Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? __eou__ You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . __eou__ What do you mean ? It will help us to relax . __eou__ Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ? __eou__ I guess you are right.But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home . __eou__ I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends . __eou__ That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong.Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . __eou__ Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us.That is excellent exercise and fun , too . __eou__ Good.Let ' s go now . __eou__ All right . __eou__
Can you do push-ups ? __eou__ Of course I can . It's a piece of cake ! Believe it or not , I can do 30 push-ups a minute . __eou__ Really ? I think that's impossible ! __eou__ You mean 30 push-ups ? __eou__ Yeah ! __eou__ It's easy . If you do exercise everyday , you can make it , too . __eou__
Can you study with the radio on ? __eou__ No , I listen to background music . __eou__ What is the difference ? __eou__ The radio has too many comerials . __eou__ That's true , but then you have to buy a record player . __eou__
Are you all right ? __eou__ I will be all right soon . I was terrified when I watched them fall from the wire . __eou__ Don't worry.He is an acrobat 。 __eou__ I see . __eou__
Hey John , nice skates . Are they new ? __eou__ Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates . __eou__ What position do you play ? __eou__ I ’ m a defender . It ’ s a lot of fun . You don ’ t have to be able to skate as fast on defense . __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re a pretty big guy . I play goalie , myself . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? Which team ? __eou__ The Rockets . __eou__ Really ? I think we play you guys next week . Well , I have to go to practice . See you later . __eou__ All right , see you later . __eou__
Hey Lydia , what are you reading ? __eou__ I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ? __eou__ It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ? __eou__ January 5th . __eou__ Let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers ! __eou__ That ’ s bogus . I don't feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense . __eou__ No , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize . __eou__ Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ? __eou__ A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you ! __eou__
Frank ’ s getting married , do you believe this ? __eou__ Is he really ? __eou__ Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much . __eou__ Who is he marring ? __eou__ A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think . __eou__ Have they set a date for the wedding ? __eou__ Not yet . __eou__
I hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs . __eou__ That ’ s right , we bought it the same day we came on the market . __eou__ What kind of house is it ? __eou__ It ’ s a wonderful Spanish style . __eou__ Oh , I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses . __eou__ And it ’ s a bargaining . A house like this in river side costs double the price . __eou__ Great , is it a two bedroom house ? __eou__ No , it has three bedrooms and three beds , and has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling . There ’ s a two-car garage . __eou__ That ’ s a nice area too . It ’ ll be a good investment for you . __eou__ Yeas , when will you buy a house ? __eou__ Not untill the end of this year , you know , just before my wedding . __eou__ Right , congratulations . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Hi , Becky , what's up ? __eou__ Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she's around . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her . __eou__ No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . __eou__ It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids . __eou__ My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . __eou__ You said she used to ? How did you stop her ? __eou__ We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . She understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful . __eou__ That sounds like a good idea . I'll have to try that . __eou__
How are Zina's new programmers working out ? __eou__ I hate to admit it , but they're good . And fast . The Filipino kid is a genius . __eou__ So you'll make the Stars.com deadline , and have us up and running next week ? __eou__ It'll be close , but we'll make it . __eou__ Good . After Stars.com starts paying us , we won't need Vikam's cash anymore . __eou__ And if we don't need them , we won't need Zina , either . __eou__
Do you like cooking ? __eou__ Yes . I like cooking very much . I got this hobby when I was 12 years sold . __eou__ Why do you like it ? __eou__ I have no idea . I like cooking by myself . I like to taste delicious food . __eou__ That's wonderful ! __eou__ And I love trying new recipes , which I usually test with my friends . You can come , too . __eou__ Really ? I hope I can have a chance to taste it . Don't forget to tell me . __eou__ Certainly . __eou__
Anyone home ? Jen ! __eou__ I'm in the kitchen ... let yourself in ! __eou__ Wow ! You're really working up a storm ! __eou__ I know . I've even worked up a sweat . __eou__ You look like a cooking show host--only messier . __eou__
You look so tan and healthy ! __eou__ Thanks . I just got back from summer camp . __eou__ How was it ? __eou__ Great . I got to try so many things for the first time . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ I went sailing , fishing , and horseback riding . __eou__ I ’ m so jealous . __eou__ The counselors were so nice too . It was the best summer ever . Except for all those mosquitoes ! __eou__
Diana , do you like the perfume I gave you ? __eou__ It ’ s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ’ t wear perfume . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know that . __eou__ That ’ s all right . Thank you all the same . __eou__

I don't know how . __eou__ You will . __eou__ Oh ... __eou__
Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday . __eou__ Oh where was that ? __eou__ I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track . __eou__ Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy.She is always making us kids eat the proper foods . __eou__ Well , it pays off for her.How old is she anyway ? __eou__ She will be 86 next month . __eou__ That is truly amazing ! __eou__

I'm from Japan . __eou__ To me English is a difficult language . __eou__ A second language is always difficult . __eou__ True , but English is harder than most . It's a crazy language . __eou__ A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? __eou__ One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . __eou__ No wonder you say English is a crazy language . __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ I hope so . I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing , and I'm not quite sure where to look . __eou__ I'll certainly try to help you .

I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television . __eou__ Thank you for you help . __eou__
Here ’ s your hot dog and beer . What happened ? Did I miss anything ? __eou__ Yeah , Cal Ripen just hit a home run . __eou__ What ’ s the score ? __eou__ Well it was 3 to 4 , but Ripen ’ s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base . __eou__ So Baltimore is winning ? __eou__ Right . __eou__ This is a really great place to watch a baseball game . __eou__ Yeah , there isn ’ t a bad seat in the place . __eou__ The fans are great here , too . Not like in Philadelphia . __eou__ It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game . __eou__ Yeah , it reminds you why they say baseball is America ’ s favorite pastime . __eou__

Every country should face the history . __eou__ Yeah , we don ’ t live in the vacuum . We have traditional values and long but different history . __eou__ Sometimes , we , human beings , really had done something wrong , so we should admit it at first . __eou__ But there is always somebody who wants to turn his back on the true history . __eou__ I believe such things won ’ t be realized , just daydreaming . __eou__
Do you like traveling , Kathy ? __eou__ I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... __eou__ Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__

You honestly believe the world ’ s improving every year ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I think that science is making us wiser .

I think it goes back about 8 generations so far . __eou__ that ’ s amazing . Do you have a large extended family ? __eou__ I ’ Ve got 30 cousins on my mom ’ s side and 10 cousins on my dad ’ s side . __eou__ are you very close to your first-cousins ? __eou__ the ones that are my age are close relatives . Now that I ’ m older , I don ’ t spend as much time with them as I used to , so I don ’ t know my younger cousins as well as the older ones . __eou__ I see . who ’ s the head of your household ? __eou__ it ’ s definitely my mother . And , her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family . __eou__ that ’ s interesting . What does your grandfather think of your step-mother ? __eou__ at first , she was quite critical of her , but now that they ’ Ve been married for a few years , she ’ s starting to accept the fact that my father divorced my mother . __eou__ that ’ s pretty much how you feel about your step-mother . Like grandmother , like grandson . __eou__
Hi , Mr . Wang . Do you feel like going boating with me ? __eou__ Sounds interesting , I haven't gone boating for some time now , and what time ? __eou__ How about tomorrow afternoon ? __eou__ Sure .

how do you usually get to school ? __eou__ I usually ride my bike . Which form of transport do you prefer to use ? __eou__ I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle , but when I feel lazy , I drive my car . __eou__ I think we should discourage people from using their private cars . They produce too much pollution ! __eou__ I agree , but I would find it difficult to stop using my car . It's just so convenient . __eou__ cars might be convenient , but they're so bad for the environment . __eou__ do you have a car ? __eou__ no . I used to have one though . Once I started using my bicycle to get around , I found that I didn't really need it . __eou__ maybe if I sold my car now , I wouldn't be so tempted to use it . __eou__ you could try . It would save you a lot of money . __eou__ that's true . Every month , I spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs . __eou__ if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too ! __eou__ I could stand to lose a few pounds . Having a car has made me lazy . I never end up walking anywhere ! __eou__ let's go to a car dealership . I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price . __eou__ sounds good ! Let's go ! __eou__

I will make friends , and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . You know , like fencing , or theater or something . __eou__
Isn't this lovely weather ?

It's going to rain soon . __eou__ Good.So we don't have to work.How nice ! __eou__ But I don't think it's so nice . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ The weather report says it's going to rain for a whole week . __eou__ Oh , I'm afraid all the flowers will die in the rain . __eou__
On , darn . The grocery store is closed . __eou__ Yeah , this one closes at ten . We could drive to the 24 - hour store on sixth . __eou__ Alright . We are out of everything . __eou__ I wish the store close to us was open 24 - house a day . __eou__ I know , our schedules are so weird . Sometimes , the little corner store is the only thing within walking distance that ’ s open when we get home . __eou__ Yeah , and the prices there are very high . __eou__ I know . Three dollars for milk . __eou__
Do you think they two will get married ? __eou__ You can count on it . __eou__ I think so.Yes , they get along so well . __eou__ I like him.He ' s good for her . __eou__ You're right . He sure is . __eou__

Then we will visit the University Museum . __eou__ Where are we going to have a drink ? __eou__ There is a coffee shop round the corner . Can you see that big building at the end of the road ? __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ That is a bank . The coffee shop is opposite the bank . __eou__ Good . I will have hot chocolate . __eou__ A stop ! Wait for the lights to turn green . __eou__ When crossing the road you must always pay attention to what's around you . __eou__ Sorry . How far is the museum ? __eou__ I am not sure . We will ask for directions in the coffee shop . __eou__ Here we are . You find us a table and I'll get the drinks . __eou__
How about going to the cinema tonight ? __eou__ That's great . What's on tonight ? __eou__ I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one . __eou__ Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better . __eou__ Don't you think it's too bloody ? __eou__ On the contrary , very exciting . __eou__
I feel so uncomfortable . __eou__ Are you sick ? __eou__ No . The teacher is dragging the chalk over the blackboard . It set my teeth on edge . __eou__ He ’ ll finish writing in a minute . __eou__
I have made up my mind . I am getting a tattoo . __eou__ Really ? Are you sure ? __eou__ Yeah ! Why not ? They are trendy and look great ! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back . __eou__ Yeah but , it is something that you will have forever ! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . On top of all that , I have heard it hurts a lot ! __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Of course ! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink . __eou__ Oh , I didn ’ t know that ! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something . __eou__ I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . Also , find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles , and that the place is hygienic . __eou__ Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing ! __eou__
Excuse me , what's the screen near your steering wheel for ? __eou__ It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now . __eou__ Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ? __eou__ News about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on . __eou__ Is there anything interesting ? __eou__ Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education . __eou__ I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ? __eou__ Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs . __eou__ That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ? __eou__ Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals . __eou__ I got it . Do you pay for the programs ? __eou__ Yes , 50 Yuan per month . __eou__
Oh , no ! __eou__ How dreadful ! __eou__ Look at the view from the window . __eou__ Oh , dear . That ’ s terrible . Not at all what I expected . __eou__ It ’ s awful , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ I can ’ t bear to look at it . I ’ m rather disappointed . __eou__ It can ’ t be helped . __eou__
What do you do in your free time , Nancy ? __eou__ Well , I like playing the violin . __eou__ Really ? How long have you been playing the violin ? __eou__ About ten years so far . I started learning when I was in middle school . __eou__ That's really interesting . __eou__ Sure . So what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ? __eou__ Well , I like collecting matchbox ! I'm not sure if that counts , though . __eou__ Of course it does . Everybody has his own hobby . __eou__
How can I tell her about this ? __eou__ Don't worry , you'll find a way . __eou__ There is no need to be so frustrated . __eou__ How can you live without job in the future ? __eou__ Don't worry , you'll find a way . __eou__
What sports do you like to play ? __eou__ I like baseball and basketball . __eou__ How about football ? __eou__ In my country football is brand new , so I never learned the game when I was younger . __eou__ It's a very popular game in America . __eou__ Yeah . I heard a lot about it . Is it really that fun ? __eou__ For me , it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play . __eou__ Are you a football player ? __eou__ No , I just for fun with my friends . We play two hand touch or flag football . We're too old to play tackle football . __eou__ What is two hand touch and flag football ? __eou__ Instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing . __eou__ I see . It's safer then right ? __eou__ Exactly . We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts . If you want to learn and play a little , you're welcome to join us . __eou__ I'll give it a try . Give me a call and let's go down together . __eou__ Ok . I'll call you Saturday morning . __eou__ Great . __eou__
What upsets you ? __eou__ My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s . Easier said then done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date . __eou__ It is not your mother finding one for you ? __eou__ I will find one myself , of course . I ’ m a modern girl . __eou__ Perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type . __eou__ You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea . __eou__ No , there is an updated virgin , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes . __eou__ I don ’ t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time . __eou__ I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so-called love at first sight . __eou__ Anyway , I don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . There are many other options using the internet as dating methods . Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional . The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher . __eou__ I don ’ t want to post my personal information on the internet . I ’ m not knowing who is reading it . __eou__
Are you going to the party on Saturday ? __eou__ I was thinking about it . Are you ? __eou__ Yeah , I heard it's going to be a lot of fun . __eou__ Really ? Well , what time does it start ? __eou__ It starts at 8 __eou__ Well , who all is going to be there ? __eou__ Everyone from school . __eou__ How do you know it's going to be so fun ? __eou__ This party is going to have a DJ , food , and drinks . __eou__ Wow , that does sound like it's going to be fun . __eou__ So am I going to see you at the party ? __eou__ Yeah , I will be there . __eou__
Could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades ? __eou__ Step into my office for a moment . What is your concern ? __eou__ Am I failing ? __eou__ Let's go on the computer to see what's up . Do you think you are doing well ? __eou__ I am pretty sure that I am in trouble . __eou__ I can see that you are trying , but where do you think you could improve ? __eou__ I missed a few classes ; I need to make sure I come to school on a regular basis . __eou__ Having a regular study routine and following it is very important , right ? __eou__ I'll try ; it's hard ! __eou__ Thanks for stopping by ! __eou__
Good luck on your test tomorrow . We'll be crossing our fingers for you ! __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
I'll never ever work together with him ! __eou__ What happened ? Quarrel again ? __eou__ Will you take my materials back from him for me ? Please ! __eou__ Don't ask me . I don't wanna be involved in your quarrel . __eou__
Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! __eou__ What ? What did you buy ? __eou__ It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! __eou__ What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? __eou__ There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . __eou__ And ? __eou__ So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . __eou__ And it's a brick ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? __eou__ I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . __eou__ So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . __eou__ Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . __eou__ But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? __eou__ He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . __eou__ Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! __eou__ C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . __eou__ That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . __eou__ You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? __eou__
Is the clock right ? __eou__ I'm afraid it gains a little . __eou__ By how many minutes ? __eou__ Two . __eou__
Hey , Mary , what's up ? __eou__ Just so so . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time , so we decided to meet again tonight . __eou__ Oh , that's exciting . What does this guy look like ? Is he hot ? __eou__ Well , I didn't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! And we have so much in common . We like the same team , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . __eou__ It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? __eou__ There's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have radar helping me spot new friends . __eou__ Well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you ask me what I value most in a friend , I would say honesty . __eou__ I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . __eou__ Yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . __eou__
What ’ s up ? You don ’ t look too good . __eou__ Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer ! __eou__ I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really . arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff . __eou__ Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe . __eou__ A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me . __eou__ It ’ s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff . __eou__ Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ’ s what the math says . __eou__ Math , sheath . What ’ s the evidence ? __eou__ There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH ! __eou__ Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ? __eou__ Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ? __eou__
Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning . But people have different views about lifelong learning . How do you understand lifelong learning ? __eou__ I think lifelong learning is the concept that it's never too soon or too late for learning __eou__ Does that mean studying all the time ? __eou__ I don't think so . I think it's about your attitude towards learning . One should be open to new ideas , decisions , skills or behaviors . __eou__ Then the axiom - ' You can't teach an old dog new tricks ' doesn't work any longer . __eou__ You're right . Lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts __eou__ Yes , I agree with you . When I retired I will participate in programs to keep momentally active . __eou__ Me too . To keep up with the changing world , one must be involved in lifelong learning and be ready to accept new things . __eou__ You know what ? I've recently been teaching myself French . __eou__ Really ? That's great ! I know that your company has a lot of clients in France . __eou__ Yes , so I want to learn French to develop my career . __eou__
How old are you ? __eou__ Nine ... but I'll be ten on May 1st.When is your birthday ? __eou__ I'm older than you ! I'll be ten on April 14th . __eou__ Are you going to have a birthday party ? __eou__ Maybe . I'll have to ask my mother . __eou__
It smells like an ashtray in here ! __eou__ Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ? __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking . __eou__ No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight ! __eou__ Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before . __eou__ I know , I know . I am trying but , I don ’ t have the willpower to just quit . I can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ? __eou__ Fine ! I want a divorce ! __eou__
Why are you shivering ? __eou__ It's freezing . __eou__
It seems that you get antsy when you hear I praise another guy . __eou__ I get antsy not because you praise a guy , but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him . __eou__ How come you think of him that way ? __eou__ Because you seem to have lost your vigilance . You should be on the watch out . __eou__ I have no reason to distrust him . He's never caused any harm . __eou__ Isn't there anything that sounds fishy ? __eou__ Nothing smells a rat . I told you that he's an all-right guy . __eou__ All-right guy ? All right . Let's talk about something else instead . __eou__
Cheese ! It tastes like cardboard . __eou__ I think so . Maybe that ’ s why it ’ s cheap here . __eou__
Have you signed up to join the company ’ s Christmas party ? __eou__ Sure , I have . Will you join ? __eou__ I will . You know , as a newcomer , I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere . __eou__ You are right . Our company ’ s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better . It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking . __eou__ I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there . __eou__ No , it will not be formal at all . It is a fun time . You will love the game show . Please dress casually . Usually there is an over abandon of drinks , so be careful with that . __eou__ Don ’ t worry , I can handle that . And I know if the boss is there , even it is an informal evening , it does not make a good impression to get totally drunk in front of him . __eou__
If the weatherman's predictions are accurate , it should rain tomorrow . __eou__ I hope not . Then we'd have to reschedule our baseball game . __eou__
hi , Emily , do you know that guy over there ? __eou__ The tall one ? Sure , that's Drive , he works with Lily . __eou__ He is cute.What dose he do ? __eou__ I'm not sure , he is a manager I think . __eou__ Really ? Are you going to introduce us ? __eou__ Well , he has already taken you know , that's his wife right there . __eou__
You didn't ring me last night . You said you would . __eou__ I'm sorry to have made you disappointed . __eou__ That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . __eou__ Was I ? Sorry , I didn ’ t mean to be . I do apologize . __eou__ And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? __eou__ Forgive me darling . I'm very tired . __eou__
Hi , Nicole . Did you have a good weekend ? __eou__ Yes , I did . But I feel tired today . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ Well , on Saturday I cleaned the house and played tennis . Then on Sunday I hiked in the country . __eou__ And I bet you studied , too . __eou__ Yeah . I studied on Sunday evening . What about you ? __eou__ Well , I didn't clean the house and I didn't study . I stayed in bed and watched TV . __eou__ That sounds like fun , but did you exercise ? __eou__ Sort of . I played golf on my computer ! __eou__
There will be a parade to celebrate National Day this weekend . __eou__ What's the route ? __eou__ From Zhongshan Circus to City Bank . __eou__ If only I could join it ! __eou__
Excuse me . I'm afraid you're in my seat . You've moved my books . __eou__ Oh , dear . __eou__ You must have realized somebody was here . __eou__ Oh , well , I looked around . There wasn't any other space . I waited a while and nobody came . I'm sorry if I've taken your place . __eou__
What ’ s the life expectancy in your country ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? __eou__ About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world . __eou__ I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . __eou__ Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . __eou__ Did she ? That ’ s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment . __eou__ How ’ s your son these days ? __eou__ Oh , he ’ s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . __eou__ He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you mine it is a good age to have a child ? __eou__ I had mine when I was 24 . that ’ s a little young . I ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . __eou__ Yes , I think you ’ re right . I ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet . __eou__ Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ? __eou__ Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed . __eou__ Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom . __eou__ It ’ s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . __eou__
I'm going to Japan this year on vacation . __eou__ Have you ever been to America ? __eou__ No , but I'd really like to . __eou__ You'd like it . __eou__
Hey , Mark , long time no see . __eou__ Julie ! It's good to see you again . How have you been ? __eou__ Great . I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand . __eou__ Really ? How was it ? __eou__ Fantastic ! I didn't want to come back . __eou__ I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful . __eou__ They are . And not only that the people are friendly , but also the food is delicious , not to mention cheap . __eou__ I do like Thai food . Did you see much of Bangkok ? __eou__ Not much . I've got enough city life in Beijing . __eou__ I know what you mean . I could use a vacation myself . __eou__ Hey , wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime ? __eou__ Yeah , it sure would . __eou__
Could I see the manager please ? I have a complaint to make . __eou__ Yes , I ’ m the manager here . What can I do for you , Madam ? __eou__ Did you have the room checked before we move in ? __eou__ Which room are you in ? __eou__ 1808 . The toilet doesn ’ t work properly , the water doesn ’ t run in the shower . __eou__ I ’ m awfully sorry to hear that . I ’ ll turn to it right away . __eou__
Congratulations , Vivian . You won the grand prize , again . __eou__ Isn't it just great ! I just knew I'd win ! __eou__ You did ? How ? Did you wear red underwear again this year ? __eou__ Not only that ! __eou__ Tell me ! Tell me ! What's your secret ? ! __eou__ OK , OK . I'll whisper it to you , but you have to promise not to tell anyone ! __eou__ What ? ! You did that ? ? ! ! ! __eou__
We are going to the concert this evening . Will you join us . __eou__ I'm very sorry I can't . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I've been snowed under with since my bosses away on business . __eou__
You'v been work here for nearly a month , how do you feel about the job ? __eou__ Not bad.Thank you for your help . I am always busy with this job , I feel a bit tired . __eou__ I had the same feeling when I first came to work here . but after a period of time , I feel better , I am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job . __eou__ I also feel that work efficiency here is very high . and you have strong working ability and professional skill , it seems that you know all , that's really wonderful ! __eou__ You know the phrase , the survival the fittest . We have no choices . __eou__ That's right , I have to work hard . __eou__
The music is on.May I have the pleasure to dance with you ? __eou__ Sorry , I'm engaged for the foxtrot.Will the next Walls be all right ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__
Excuse me , is this seat taken ? __eou__ No , please feel free . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__ Do you work in Shanghai ? __eou__ Yes I do . How about you ? __eou__ No , I'm a tourist . This place is amazing ! It's much bigger than I imagined , and much more exciting ! There's so much to see here . __eou__ You can say that again ! It's much more modern than people imagine . Where are you from ? __eou__ Um , well let's see ... I'm from Kansas originally . A much quieter and more peaceful place than here , that's for sure ! __eou__ Uh huh ... __eou__
Look at this headline , Soo Mi . __eou__ Wow ! So many people in the United States get divorced ! __eou__ Is it the same in Korea ? __eou__ I don't think so . In Korea some marriages break up , but most couples stay together . __eou__ Do people get married young ? __eou__ Not really . Very few people get married beforethe age of 20 . __eou__ Hmm . Do women usually work after they get married ? __eou__ No , a lot of women stay home and take care of their families . But some work . __eou__
Boy ! What a beauty ! I fall in love with her at the first sight . __eou__ The beauty under the tree ? __eou__ Of course.No girl is more charming . __eou__ She is a young man ! __eou__
Excuse me.Where do I register ? __eou__ Oh , over there in Pacific Pavilion . __eou__ Is that the large , white building ? __eou__ Yeah , that's it . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
How was your education going on in Australia ? __eou__ I'm going to graduate this summer . __eou__ Where are you going to work then , in Australia or back in China ? __eou__ I'm planning to return to China after graduation . __eou__ Why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad . __eou__ Well , I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment . __eou__ Yeah , China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country . __eou__
Do you have any particular hobbies , Tom ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I love playing badminton , table tennis and computer games . And playing the games has become my favorite . __eou__ I hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers . And they don't care about their own health at all . How about you ? __eou__ I'm no better than them . They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time , but I think it's stimulating . __eou__ You won't play online games full of violence , will you ? __eou__ Once in a while . __eou__ It's no good . And I think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time . You might as well do something healthy and meaningful . __eou__ I hope I can practice self-control again . __eou__
What ’ s the plot of your new movie ? __eou__ It ’ s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . I play the part of the detective . He has to catch the killer , but there ’ s very little evidence . It ’ s a psychological th __eou__ Did you enjoy making the movie ? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director . __eou__ I have had disagreement with every director . I ’ Ve worked with . We ’ Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . It was the same when I made this movie . I don ’ t no __eou__ Critics are not very happy with the movies that you ’ Ve made recently . Does that bother you ? __eou__ Not at all . The feedback from audience has been great . I care about what they think more than what the critics think . __eou__ Did you do you own stunts in the movie ? __eou__ I wanted to , but my insurance company wouldn ’ t let me . All of my stunts were done by a stuntman . As you know , I used to do my own stunts , but I ’ ll leave that to the experts in future . __eou__ Thank you very much for doing this interview . __eou__ My pleasure . Have you seen the movie yet ? __eou__ Yes . I have . I liked it very much . Like you , I was very impressed with Rachel ’ s performance in the movie . She ’ s going to be a star . __eou__
Who's that old lady trimming the trees ? __eou__ She's my grandma . __eou__ She's looks very healthy.How old is she ? __eou__ 92 . __eou__
Mom . My legs are killing me . __eou__ Hold on . We will be successful right away . __eou__
Oh , man . I had the best supper last night . My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing ! __eou__ I love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce . Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts . Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger ! Mmm ! Mmm ! It ’ s almost lunchtime . I would die for a plate of stir fry right now ! __eou__ Well , you can keep the vegetables , I ’ ll take the meat . The stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion ... __eou__ What ? You call that a stir fry ? More meat than vegetables ? That ’ s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry . What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap ! __eou__
What did you say ? __eou__ I said it's a lovely day . Why don't we go for a walk ? __eou__ Well , I feel a little tired . __eou__ Come on ! A little labor , much health . __eou__ Then can you wait a few minutes ? I want to finish writing this letter . __eou__ Don't take too long . It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather . __eou__ I won't be long . No more than ten minutes . Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park ? __eou__ I Believe I will . Look for me near the lake . __eou__
Thank god you showed up when you did ! He ’ s insane ! Do you think we should call the police ? __eou__ Don ’ t worry about it , I ’ ll call my friend and have him take care of it . I can ’ t believe he was stalking you all these years . What a nut job ! __eou__ I know ! Well ... he said I ’ m not pregnant . I ’ m sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing . I want you to know that I didn ’ t do it on purpose ... __eou__ Don ’ t apologize ! From the moment I met you , not a day has gone by when I haven ’ t thought of you.And now that I ’ m with you again , I ’ m ... I ’ m just scared , Veronica . The closer I get to you , the worse it gets . The thought of not being with you , I mean , I just can ’ t handle it ! We were made for each other , Veronica . You are my everything , my soul mate . What can I do ? __eou__ Just hold me ... I ’ ll always be here for you , no matter what . And together , we can tackle whatever life throws at us . I believe in us , steven . __eou__ I ’ m so happy to hear that ! I knew we belong together . I love you so much . __eou__
Zina , can I talk to you about something personal ? __eou__ As long as it doesn't take too long . __eou__ My boyfriend says I work too much . That I spend more time with you than with him . __eou__ Was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend ? __eou__ He said not to bother coming back . And I said , fine , I won't . __eou__ So what's the problem ? __eou__
Mary , how was your date with john ? __eou__ it's ok . It seems we have a lot in common . __eou__ oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ? __eou__ he is tall and slim , fair-haired . __eou__ sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? __eou__ he is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . __eou__ oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ? __eou__ he didn't say , but he said he would call me . __eou__ maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much ! __eou__ oh , steve . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What if he doesn't call ? __eou__ come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry . __eou__ thank you , Steve . You're always so encouraging . __eou__ that's what friends are for . __eou__
Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ? __eou__ It was a nightmare . __eou__ What ’ s up ? __eou__ Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year . __eou__ Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ? __eou__ Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout . __eou__ This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ? __eou__ I am still waiting for their call . __eou__ Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward . __eou__
So the company decided to cancel your trip to Hong Kong ? __eou__ Yes , The SARS epidemic is not under effective control yet . So I'd better not risk it . __eou__ Maybe it's a good things . If you don't have to go to Hong Kong , you can take a break and take things easy for a while . __eou__ You are right . Maybe we should work out a fitness plan and start to do more exercise . Sitting around in the office all day is no way of keeping fit . __eou__ That's a good idea . Let's see if we can get more people in this plan . There isn't much business these days anyway , so I think many people will be interested . __eou__
Which pair of jeans do you like best ? __eou__ I really like the straight legs . __eou__ But they aren't very fashionable . What about these ? __eou__ I don't like the way they sag down . I feel like I have plumber butt in them . __eou__ That's the style ! You just wear boxers . __eou__ What if someone got it in their head to give them a tug ? What then ? __eou__ You're so old fashioned ! Nobody is going to pull down your pants ! __eou__ If you ask me , it's a walking invitation ! __eou__
Hi , Charles . What's the matter ? __eou__ Oh ! ! My car isn't working . I'm waiting for a tow-truck . __eou__ Do you have a ride home ? __eou__ Yes , my wife is coming to get me . __eou__ That's good . Do you live near here ? __eou__ No , we live in the suburbs . What about you ? __eou__ I live downtown , with my parents . __eou__ Do you have a car ? __eou__ I don't need a car . I walk to work . __eou__ You're lucky ! __eou__
Happy anniversary , sweetheart ! __eou__ Yes . to our first anniversary and many more to come . Cheers ! __eou__ I'll drink to that . Thanks for making this a night worth remembering . __eou__ Well , it's a special day . They say if you survive the first year , the rest is smooth sailing . __eou__ That's good to know . Oh , listen ! The band's playing our song . __eou__ I requested it . What do you say ? Do you have your dancing shoes on ? __eou__ Always . __eou__
What do you plan to do for your birthday ? __eou__ I want to have a picnic with my friends , Mum . __eou__ How about a party at home ? That way we can get together and celebrate it . __eou__ OK , Mum . I'll invite my friends home . __eou__
How about seconds , Victor ? __eou__ No.thanks . I'm full . __eou__
Why don't you have dinner with me tonight ? __eou__ I'd love to . __eou__ Let's say about 6:00 ? __eou__ That's OK with me . __eou__
Cigarette ? __eou__ Oh , uh ... Thanks . Henry , do you have a light ? __eou__ Sorry , here . __eou__ Thanks . Lovely day . Pity I ’ m on duty . __eou__ I ’ ll stand in with you if you like . I ’ Ve got nothing else to do . __eou__ Oh , no . I couldn ’ t possibly . __eou__
Hi Rose , what are you busy with right now ? __eou__ Hi Jack , I'm working on these documents . The manager wants them for half an hour . __eou__ Well , Rose . __eou__ Is there something any need ? __eou__ Are your free this weekend ? __eou__ Yes , I have nothing to do . __eou__ Great , Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend ? __eou__ I beg your pardon ? __eou__ I'd like to call on you this weekend . I just want to a drop in for a chat . __eou__ Really ? well , ok , you're welcome . __eou__ Is 5 PM . Saturday a good time for you ? __eou__ Hmm , how about seven ? I can treat you to dinner . __eou__ Sure , that would be great . I'll bring the wine . __eou__ OK . Then I'll be expecting you . __eou__ I'll be there on time . __eou__
How do you shoot pool ? __eou__ You have 16 balls on the table , 7 solid colored , 7 striped colored , a black 8 ball , and the white ball . __eou__ And ? __eou__ You hit the white ball with your cue . The white ball hits the colored balls . And you want to get the colored balls into the pockets . __eou__ How do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one ? __eou__ At the beginning , it does not matter , but once someone gets one ball in , it is set . __eou__ Can I get the black ball in ? __eou__ The black ball has to be the final ball in the pockets . __eou__ Let's go and try now ! __eou__
How about going to hear a country-and-western singer tonight ? __eou__ I'd enjoy that . __eou__ I'll pick you up around 8: 00 . __eou__ OK . I'll see you then . __eou__
The mosquitos are biting me ! __eou__ Me , too , I can ’ t stop scratching . They are everywhere ! Sneaky little jerks . __eou__ Do you have any bug spray ? __eou__ No , I forgot to buy some . __eou__ Then we ’ ll have to put up with it . __eou__ We can cover ourselves with beer ! That way if they bite us , they ’ ll get drunk and fall asleep . __eou__ That ’ s without a doubt , the best idea you ’ Ve had ! Let ’ s do it ! __eou__ Run ! They are thirsty for more ! __eou__
Stop running around in front of the TV , will you ? Why don't you just sit and watch ? __eou__ I've tried , but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program . __eou__ Then stay away . No one is keeping you from doing that . __eou__ Don't be so irritable . I just don't understand the program , that's all . __eou__ All right , I will explain it to you later on . Now scram . __eou__ Ok . I will wait until you have had your fun , if that's what you want . __eou__ That's exactly what I want , thank you . __eou__
Okay , can I ask you something direct ? __eou__ Ha ! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush . __eou__ Fair enough . Give it to me straight . Did she bully you into this ? __eou__ No , seriously . . . I really want this . __eou__ I tell ya , when I got the invite , it really threw me for a loop . You've done a complete 180 . __eou__ I know . But things have changed . I guess I've settled down . __eou__ I guess so . __eou__
My daughter plans to quit her present job and wants to find another . She says she wants to get a better job with higher pay . __eou__ It seems quite normal to me . It is pretty much what I want to do . __eou__ But what about settling down to start a family ? Doesn't anyone want to get married any more ? __eou__ It is different now . The world is becoming colorful . Some of my friends don't feel the same pressure to marry . We all want to wait for the right moment . __eou__ What time is the right moment ? __eou__ Let the universe find us instead of forcing love . We prefer natural love . The most important thing is to be happy . Love will find us later . That is what we say . __eou__
Please excuse me , but I really have to be going . __eou__ Yes , of course.It was nice to see you . __eou__ It was nice to see you , too.And please give my regards to Mrs.Robbins . __eou__
Excuse me . Is this seat taken ? __eou__ I'm afraid so . __eou__
What do you think of the coming match ? __eou__ Winning is a piece of cake to me . __eou__ You are bragging again . __eou__
What would you reckon the taxing increases ? __eou__ Well , the state will benefit a lot , I suppose . __eou__ But what do most people think about it ? __eou__ Ah , it ’ s hard to say . __eou__
are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ? __eou__ of course . Is the dinner still on ? __eou__ yes , I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place . __eou__ we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice . __eou__ that's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark . __eou__ it can't be that bad . __eou__ I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here . __eou__ really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime . __eou__ do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better . __eou__ ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ? __eou__ when I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation . __eou__ has anything else happened to you ? __eou__ nothing else has happened to me , but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close . __eou__ well , we'll be careful . Thanks for letting me know . __eou__
Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not . __eou__ Why doesn't he ask her ? __eou__ He is too scared to ask her . __eou__ He's a chicken guy . __eou__
I don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit . __eou__ Yeah . Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian . She's almost driving Li Na crazy . __eou__ If I were Li Na , I would ask her if she had done that . __eou__ She is as meek as a lamb . She never goes against anyone or anything . She's as good as gold , you know ? __eou__
Where is John ? I can't find him anywhere . __eou__ Haven't you heard that he is in prison ? __eou__ What ? Beg your pardon . __eou__ John is in prison now.He was copped outstealing . __eou__ I just cann't believe my ears ! __eou__
What do you need ? __eou__ I need to use the Internet . __eou__ You have your library card , right ? __eou__ Yes , I do . __eou__ There is a wait right now to use the computers . __eou__ That ’ s fine . __eou__ Would you please write your name on this list ? __eou__ Then what ? __eou__ I will call you when a computer is free . __eou__ How do I log on to the computer ? __eou__ Use the number on the back of your library card . __eou__ Thanks . I ’ ll be sitting over there . __eou__
What a nice tie you are wearing ! __eou__ Thank you.But does it really look all right ? __eou__ Certainly.It matches your suit perfectly . __eou__ Then does it go well with my sweater ? __eou__ Yes.You look very smart today . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
What do you make of the case ? __eou__ If you ask me , I don ’ t think it ’ s guilty . __eou__ What do you mean by saying so ? __eou__ I mean it ’ s not his fault . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? __eou__ Yes . Don ’ t you think he should be pitied rather than accused ? __eou__
Happy Mother's Day , Mom ! __eou__ Thanks ! These are beautiful . You shouldn't have ! __eou__ Of course I should have ! You certainly deserve them ! You put up with all of us . __eou__ I forgot what I put up with . In that case , I do deserve these flowers . __eou__
I have a real problem when I meet people . __eou__ What is it ? Maybe I can help . __eou__ I never know when to shake hands and when not to . Can you tell me something about it ? __eou__ Do you come from a country where they shake hands ? __eou__ Oh yes . Men , women , and children shake hands all the time . __eou__ It ’ s very simple . Men shake hands , women and children don ’ t . __eou__ But some women do shake hands . And now a lot of children have such good manners , they shake hands too . __eou__ Well , a good rule to follow is , for men you hold out your hand , for women and children , you wait and see what they do . __eou__ That sounds easy enough . __eou__ Sure . Once you get the hang of it , it ’ s a piece of cake ! It ’ s nothing to worry about . __eou__
Sam , I am so sorry . It was your birthday yesterday and I completely forgot about it . __eou__ Don't worry about it . I keep forgetting everyone's birthdays as well . __eou__ Margaret really told me off when she found out that I had forgotten all about it . We did try to phone you , but you and Jane must have gone out . __eou__ Yes , Jane invited me for dinner to this new restaurant which opened near us . __eou__ Oh , yes , I know the one . How was the food ? __eou__ The food was excellent , but Jane ordered a birthday cake , which they forgot about . So as you can see , you were not the only one . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ Yes , Jane was quite upset about it . The manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert , but still ... __eou__ I would think this was the least they could do . __eou__ In the end it was a nice evening and I got an iPad as my birthday present which I wanted for a while . __eou__ Great . I have also been thinking of getting one . Do you think you could ask Jane to have a quiet word with Margaret ? My birthday is not that far away . __eou__ I can try , but knowing Margaret she will see through that immediately . __eou__
Here's the restaurant we're meeting the Smiths at . __eou__ Let's go in to wait for them . __eou__ After you . __eou__
When do you usually go to the movies ? __eou__ I usually go in my free time on the weekends . How about you ? __eou__ The movie theater is always so crowded on the weekends . I like to go to the movies during the week . __eou__ That's true . And sometimes the tickets are cheaper during the week as well . __eou__
Are you telling us a lie again ? __eou__ I will be hanged if I lying . __eou__ All right . But what was the trouble ? __eou__ My car run out of petrol . __eou__
I can't believe Mr . Fro didn't buy it . Who does that guy think he is anyway ? Bill Gates ? __eou__ He had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked . __eou__ Time to order . Balista , today I want a skinny triple latte . __eou__ When did you start worrying about your weight ? __eou__ I'm not . I just don't feel like drinking whole milk today . Why ? Do you think I'm fat ? __eou__ No , Jess , chill out ! __eou__
Come on , Tara . Let ’ s go up to the window and buy two tickets . The movie is starting in a few minutes . __eou__ We can ’ t break into the line . Don ’ t be so impatient . We ’ ll be at the front of the line soon . __eou__ Two tickets , please . How much are they ? __eou__ Oh no , Ari . I didn ’ t mean for you to pay for me when I invited you to go tonight . Let ’ s go Dutch . I ’ ll pay my own way . I insist . __eou__ I ’ m looking forward to this film . I read a good review of it in this morning ’ s newspaper . __eou__ Me , too . It will be great to see something light and funny for a change . I ’ m tired of heavy drama . __eou__ Are these seats okay ? __eou__ They ’ re fine , but I can ’ t watch a movie without popcorn . __eou__
Do you often buy magazines ? __eou__ I buy a computer magazine every month . It keeps me up-to date with all the latest developments . __eou__ Why don ’ t you find the information on the internet instead ? __eou__ Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for . Besides , I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes . __eou__ Do you have an online edition of that magazine ? __eou__ Yes , they do . But you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription . __eou__ Do you have a subscription ? __eou__ Yes , I do . The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month . Do you every buy magazines ? __eou__ I only buy them if they look particularly interesting . I don ’ t buy any regularly . __eou__
Mumm . Those burgers smell great . It's perfect day for a barbecue . __eou__ It sure is . I'm glad it didn't rain . My name's Mike Gates , by the way . __eou__ Oh , hi ! I'm Barbara Johnson . Nice to meet you . __eou__ I'm sorry . What's your name again ? __eou__ Barbara . But please , just call me Barb . __eou__ So Barb ... what do you do ? __eou__ I'm studying medicine . __eou__ Really ? Where ? __eou__ At Harvard . What about you ? __eou__ I'm an engineer at IBM . __eou__ Oh , are you ? That sounds interesting . __eou__ Yeah . I like it . Hey , it looks like the food is ready . __eou__ Good . I'm starving . __eou__
Wow ! I can't believe I'm standing here ! __eou__ What are you so excited about ? __eou__ I'm standing in front of an exquisite work of art ! __eou__ What's the big deal ? It's just a picture of some woman . __eou__ I've seen it so many times in books , but I never imagined I'd get to see it in person . __eou__ There are tons of other paintings that I think are better . __eou__ Maybe so , but do you have any idea how much this one is worth ? __eou__ No , how much is it worth ? __eou__ About 80 million dollars . __eou__ Whoa . __eou__
hey , Maris , are you a part-timer ? __eou__ part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ? __eou__ oh , it ’ s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ? __eou__ sure , I have a part-time job as a bartender . __eou__ cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar ! __eou__ yeah , but I ’ m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset . __eou__ that ’ s true . I ’ m wondering did you learn anything from the job ? __eou__ of course . There ’ s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world . __eou__ you mean you got working experience , right ? __eou__ not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life . __eou__ it must be very demanding . __eou__ sometimes it is . But after working for a few weeks , it ’ s easy to figure out . __eou__ really ? It sounds interesting . __eou__ maybe you can come to the bar one day and I ’ ll show you around . __eou__ great . I ’ m looking forward to it . __eou__
Have you seen that house ? __eou__ Yes , it looks interesting . __eou__ You're right . I love it very much . __eou__ It must be old . __eou__ At least more than 100 years old . __eou__ Let's enter it ! __eou__ I can't open the door . __eou__ It must be locked . __eou__ Let me ask the old woman in that reception office . __eou__ She can't answer you . __eou__ She must be deaf . __eou__ It must be a haunted house . Are you frightened ? __eou__ Frightened ? You must be joking . __eou__
Have you got any hobbies ? __eou__ Yes . I'm fond of playing the chess and I'm very keen on playing cards . __eou__ Which is easier to learn ? __eou__ Both , but the rules of playing cards vary in different places . __eou__
Jim , how was your weekend ? __eou__ I went to the beach with my friends and had a barbecue there . __eou__ That sounds like a lot of fun . Did you go swimming , too ? __eou__ Sure . I think it ’ s a fantastic place to go . __eou__ I couldn ’ t agree more . That ’ s an ideal place for a vacation . __eou__ It sure is . __eou__ I can ’ t wait to go there myself . __eou__
You'd better prepare for the examination . __eou__ I don't think the exam will be very hard . __eou__ You should change your attitude , or you will not pass the course . __eou__ Maybe you're right . I have been too lazy lately . __eou__
It is high time you have a talk with him . That may help clear the mists . __eou__ I did , but he gives me a runaround . __eou__ If I were you , I would put the whole matter on the table . __eou__ But he was trying to beat about the bush . And my talk with him was fruitless . __eou__
What is the correct time , please ? __eou__ It's exactly twelve minutes past seven . __eou__ When will the lecture begin ? __eou__ It'll begin at nine o'clock sharp . __eou__
Should I ask Sara to the party ? __eou__ I would if I were you . __eou__
If he promised to help you , I'm sure he will help . He's a man of his word . __eou__ You said it . I always count on him when I need his help . __eou__ Last year he helped me out of trouble , too . __eou__
We're having a sixties party next week . Do you want to come ? __eou__ What is a sixties party ? __eou__ You come dressed in anything from the sixties . __eou__ That sounds like fun . But where can I get clothes that old ? __eou__ Check out your mom's closet . I'll bet she still has something . __eou__ Good idea . Can I bring some music from that period too ? __eou__ That will be great ! Do you have LPs or Cds ? __eou__ Don't tell me you have a record player ! __eou__
I want to improve my handwriting , and I've practiced it for several weeks , but nothing happened . You see , my handwriting is still bad . __eou__ Oh , come on . You know it's a long process , you have to be patient . __eou__ I know it , but I don't know when I can make it better . __eou__ A , whatever you do , the most important is perseverance . So you have to hang on there , the longer , the better . Then some day , you will find you've already made a lot of progress . __eou__ Yeah , you are right . I must stop complaining and stick to it every day . __eou__ Yeah ! Where there is a will , there is a way . __eou__
I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby ! __eou__ My first grandchild . __eou__ And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does . __eou__ Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though . __eou__ Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does . __eou__ Well , children usually resemble their parents . __eou__ It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is . __eou__ You often like comparing children with their parents . __eou__ You ’ re right . __eou__
The music has started . __eou__ How do you like this waltz ? __eou__ It's very nice . __eou__ May I ask you for a dance ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ You are doing the waltz wonderfully well . __eou__ Thanks . I'm glad you say so . Oh , the music has stopped . __eou__
Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ? __eou__ Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English . __eou__ I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ? __eou__ Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said . __eou__ It must be interesting to study English . __eou__ Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss Parker says that my pronunciation is very good . __eou__ Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ? __eou__ Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them . __eou__
Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! __eou__ What is it ? What happened ? __eou__ I think someone is stalking me . __eou__ No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? __eou__ I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . __eou__ Did he leave when you left ? __eou__ Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ He followed me all the way home ! __eou__ That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . __eou__ Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? __eou__ Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . __eou__ Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! __eou__ Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . __eou__ I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . __eou__ Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry . __eou__ Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . __eou__
Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ? __eou__ I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ? __eou__ I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . __eou__ Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . __eou__ Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . __eou__ But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? __eou__ Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . __eou__ I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? __eou__ That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . __eou__ Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? __eou__ Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . __eou__ How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? __eou__ That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . __eou__ So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? __eou__ Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . __eou__ Why did they want to found a college ? __eou__ Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__ Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . __eou__ When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? __eou__ In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . __eou__ It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . __eou__ Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard . __eou__ Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history . __eou__ Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S . __eou__ I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard . __eou__ Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related . __eou__ That ’ s right . I have a lot to learn from you . __eou__ You can ask me any question at any time . __eou__
I am not convinced by your explanation . Could you explain it ? __eou__ Sorry , I really can't do that . There's little time left for us . __eou__ I can't accept your excuse . It's five o'clock . __eou__ But I have an appointment with Ann . __eou__ Ok , sounds good . But I think it's your trick . __eou__
What do you do in summer ? __eou__ I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride . I love being out in the fresh summer air . How about you ? __eou__ I don ’ t often go for walks , but I either play sports outside-you know , tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book . __eou__ What do you do in winter ? __eou__ Well , I play sports indoors quite often . If I ’ m feeling lazy , I just watch a film at home . I prefer summer to winter . __eou__ I think most people do . I like wearing nice , colorful clothes in summer-you know , a nice dress or skirt . It ’ s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter . __eou__ Yes . I like wearing shorts in summer . My legs would freeze ! __eou__ Do you think we ’ ll have a nice summer this year ? __eou__ Thanks to global warming , it could be hotter than ever ! __eou__
I will never forget Linda . After all , she was my first lover . __eou__ I think you ’ ll lay it to rest with the time flying . __eou__ I remember that someone says that it is difficult to forget the people who don ’ t want to forget . __eou__ But I think time can change everything . __eou__
Could you tell me what university you want to go to , John ? __eou__ Pardon ? __eou__ What university would you enter ? __eou__ University ? Why ? You asked me last year . __eou__ Oh , I forget.Sorry . __eou__ I went to Harvard University . __eou__ Did you ? And what course did you take there ? __eou__ God save me ! Is there anything wrong with you ? Didn't I tell you ? __eou__ I've not known.Perhaps , I've got a bad memory . __eou__ I did a B . A . in economics.Remember ? __eou__ Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A . __eou__
I've been chosen to plan the next family reunion . __eou__ Fun for you ! Do you get to do anything you want ? __eou__ Yep . And I should start planning now . __eou__ Does everyone usually show up for your family reunions ? __eou__ Just about . There are at least a few hundred in our immediate family alone . __eou__ How Ay days will the reunion be ? __eou__ Usually it's at least five days and four nights . __eou__ This is going to be a major production for you ! __eou__
Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia . __eou__ Nice to meet you , Lvan.My name is Alike . I'm from Japan . __eou__ To me English is a difficult language . __eou__ A second language is always difficult . __eou__ True , but English is harder than most.It ' s a crazy language . __eou__ A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? __eou__ One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . __eou__ No wonder you say English is a crazy language . __eou__
What did you think of the film ? __eou__ I liked it . I thought it was great . __eou__ Yes , I liked it , too . Did you like the acting ? __eou__ Yes . I thought it was excellent . Didn't you ? __eou__ Not really . I thought it was disappointing . __eou__ It's a nice cinema , isn't it ? __eou__ Do you think so ? I don't like it very much . I found it rather uncomfortable . __eou__
What ’ s up ? You don ’ t look too good . __eou__ Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer ! __eou__ I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really , arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff . __eou__ Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe . __eou__ A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me . __eou__ It ’ s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff . __eou__ Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ’ s what the math says . __eou__ Math , sheath . What ’ s the evidence ? __eou__ There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH ! __eou__ Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ? __eou__ Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ? __eou__

Hey ! How was your first day of class ? I ’ m in level two and I ’ m loving my class this semester ! It ’ s great being in a class of international students ! __eou__ Mine was ok , except that no one in my class speaks English . I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester . __eou__ That ’ s both fortunate and unfortunate . It ’ s the United Nations in my class ! We have people from all over the world ! There are three Germans , a Pole , a Scottish , two French , an American , a Brazilian , __eou__ That ’ s quite the array of nationalities . Everyone in my class is from Asia , except me . There are a few South Koreans , several Japanese , Malaysian , Thai , Singaporean , Filipino , Kazakhstan , and o __eou__ Well , I think you ’ re pretty lucky actually . You ’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture . __eou__ I guess so , but I think it ’ s going to be hard to relate to my classmates , especially with the language barrier . I think I might change classes . __eou__ Don ’ t ! Stay the course ! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful . I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice . __eou__ I highly doubt it . Your girlfriend is Chinese . __eou__ Well , there is that , yes . __eou__

I admire the bravery of plum blossoms . __eou__ But it used to be ignored by many people . __eou__ The bright people will remember it forever . __eou__ Well , it's snowing . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms when snowing . __eou__

I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work . __eou__ I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music . __eou__ Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better . __eou__ Really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress . __eou__ Yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework . __eou__ I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brian power . __eou__ You can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier . __eou__ That ’ s true . There ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character . __eou__
There is a new coffee shop opening up down the street . __eou__ I hope that they have a good menu . Most coffee shops only have coffee and Danish . __eou__ That's right .

He likes children and always wants a child of his own . __eou__ In fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese . __eou__ Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ? __eou__ It ’ s still a mystery . Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant . But she begins to take her maternity leave now . __eou__ Oh ! You mean she doesn ’ t have to work now ? It ’ s hard for young parents not to overreact , isn ’ t it ? __eou__

What's your favourite dance ? __eou__ It's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz . __eou__ How about tango ? __eou__ Oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ? __eou__ Tango is my favorite . Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot . ( the music has stopped ) __eou__ Thank you for the dance . __eou__ My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . __eou__ OK . __eou__
I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . __eou__ Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . __eou__ We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . __eou__ The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it . __eou__ I think you're right . There needs to be an international response to this problem ? __eou__
I just had a terrible week . __eou__ What a shame ! __eou__ I fell down and hurt my arm . __eou__ That's too bad . __eou__ Then my son drove into a tree . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . __eou__ The dog bit the delivery boy . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ And a storm blew our roof away . __eou__ Ho , no ! __eou__
I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby ! __eou__ My first grandchild . __eou__ And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does . __eou__ Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though . __eou__ Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does . __eou__ Well , children usually resemble their parents . __eou__ It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is . __eou__ You often like comparing children with their parents . __eou__ You ’ re right . __eou__
When do you go to bed usually ? __eou__ I go to bed at ten and get up at six . __eou__ That's helpful for your health . __eou__ Sure . __eou__
Have you been ever been to Disneyworld ? __eou__ When I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ? __eou__ The one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland . __eou__ That's right . Why do you ask ? __eou__ Well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon . __eou__ When are getting married ? __eou__ Some time next year . We haven't set the date yet . __eou__ Congratulations ! I had no idea . __eou__ Thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ? __eou__ Do you like amusement parks ? __eou__ For the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though . __eou__ If you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time . __eou__ Even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ? __eou__ Even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun . __eou__ Thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight . __eou__ I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it ! __eou__
Can you speak French ? __eou__ Yes , I can , but not very well . __eou__ Can you understand your Spanish teacher ? __eou__ More or less . How well do you understand Mr . Wang , your Chinese teacher ? __eou__ About 40 percent , if he speaks slowly.When he speaks fast , I can only catch a word here and there . But Mr . Wang is an excellent Chinese teacher.With his help , my Chinese is getting better and better e __eou__
you look better today . How did your test go ? __eou__ much better than it did yesterday . __eou__ did you pass ? __eou__ I not only passed my test , but I aced it ! I'm so happy ! __eou__ you should be . You worked really hard last night preparing for it . __eou__ thanks for helping me with it . If you hadn't encouraged me to do my best , I wouldn't have ever been able to pass . __eou__ you don't have to thank me . It's just a part of my job as your counsellor . __eou__ did you always do well at school ? __eou__ no , in fact , I was terrible at taking exams . __eou__ really ? __eou__ sure , but my teachers always encouraged me to do the best that I could and that helped me a lot . When are your final exams ? __eou__ I'll get my finals in two months . __eou__ when do you plan on studying for those exams ? __eou__ most students just cram the night forehead . __eou__ do you think that's a good idea ? __eou__ no , I think I should study a little bit at a time , starting a few weeks before the exam . __eou__ that sounds like a good idea . What are you going to do if you have any questions while you're studying ? __eou__ I'll go and talk to my professor or a learning support assistant . __eou__ it sounds like you've learned something useful this year ! __eou__
Can I borrow your Cds for our school dance ? __eou__ Oh , you don't ask much , do you ? __eou__ I promise I will personally guard every single one and they will come back in perfect condition . __eou__ I'll tell you what . Your class can rent them from me for the night and buy back any damaged ones . __eou__ That sounds fair . That's still cheaper than paying a band to come play for us . __eou__ Not as fun though . A live band is way more exciting ! __eou__ Our class doesn't have enough money . We already checked into it . __eou__ Let me know with your next dance . I know a band that may give you a break for the publicity . __eou__
Do you want to go to the beach tonight ? __eou__ Sure , which beach are we going to ? __eou__ I wanted to go to Malibu beach . __eou__ I like Santa Monica . __eou__ The water there looks so dirty . __eou__ I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica . __eou__ I like the pier too , because it's beautiful at night . __eou__ Is Malibu beach nice ? __eou__ It's a lot nicer , and I really like it better . __eou__ So you want to go to Malibu ? __eou__ If that's okay with you . __eou__ Sure , let's go to Malibu . __eou__
There are so many environment problems in the world today . Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ? __eou__ I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan for action , but I doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late . __eou__ We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . There ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . Developing countries put more emphasis on economic development than on environment protection . __eou__ Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ’ re not thinking about the long-term damage to the forests . We should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life . __eou__ In other parts of the world , especially in Africa , there is a problem with desertification . Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . In means that people cannot grow enough food . __eou__ It also means that people sometimes fight over the famp 3land that remains . Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people . __eou__ Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment . __eou__ I think I ’ d like to do that . I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies . __eou__
Kathy ! How are you ? It's been ages ! What are you doing these days ? __eou__ I just opened my own restaurant . I'm also head chef . __eou__ You're kidding ! You've always hated cooking ! __eou__ Well , I used to hate cooking , but now I love it . __eou__ When did you change your mind ? __eou__ After I tried French food . Before that , I used to cook really boring things for my family . __eou__ I still can't believe it ! So , did you go to cooking school or something ? __eou__ Yeah . I went to California to study . __eou__ Really ? How long did you stay there ? __eou__ I was there between 88 and 90 . __eou__ And what did you do after that ? __eou__ Then I came back here . I worked for about three years to get some experience . __eou__
Susan , I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend . __eou__ A house warming party ? __eou__ Yes , Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn . __eou__ Congratulations ! That ’ s wonderful . I bet both of you are quite happy . __eou__ Well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate 1 in this area is extremely expensive . __eou__ I understand . That ’ s why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town , far from the city . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea if you can find employment nearby . __eou__ I agree . That ’ s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin . __eou__
What can I do for you ? __eou__ I am trying to find this book . __eou__ What ’ s the problem ? __eou__ It doesn ’ t seem like this library has it . __eou__ Have you checked the computer ? __eou__ I have already . __eou__ What did it say ? __eou__ It says the book is on the shelf , but I didn ’ t find it there . __eou__ I can always borrow the book from another library . __eou__ You can do that ? __eou__ I ’ ll make the call and contact you when it gets in . __eou__ That ’ s fantastic . Thank you . __eou__
ABC Rent-a-Car . May I help you ? __eou__ I would like to rent a car . What kind of car do you have ? __eou__ We have Volkswagen , Pinto , Plymouth and Datsun . __eou__ What is the rate ? __eou__ Twenty dollars per day for Volkswagen , Pinto and Datsun , and twenty-seven dollars for Plymouth . __eou__ How about mileage and gas ? __eou__ There is no charge for mileage . And fill up the gas when you return the car to us as it is not included . __eou__ OK . I'll try a Pinto . I want to rent a car for one week . __eou__ All right , sir . May I have your driver's license ? __eou__ Here you are . __eou__
Would you be willing to accompany me to the party tonight ? __eou__ Sure , I'd love to . __eou__
Which film shall we see ? __eou__ There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert ? __eou__ Yes , I'd love to.Here is a good one , Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall . __eou__ Fine ! Do you want anything to eat now ? __eou__ No , I'm not hungry . __eou__ Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun . __eou__
Spring Festival is the most important festival in China , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , that's true . __eou__ How long is the holiday ? __eou__ It depends.But usually it's about 15 days . __eou__ Do you eat any special food for the festival ? __eou__ Yes , dumpling is a must.There is also other food.For example , people eat chicken for good luck . __eou__ That's interesting . I'm told the Chinese firework is very beautiful , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it's really wonderful ! __eou__ Oh , great ! I hope I can spend this Spring Festival with you here in Beijing . __eou__ I'm sure you'll have a good time . __eou__
I'm really sick of waiting for a bus . __eou__ Yeah.Especially when you have something urgent to do . __eou__ But a taxi costs too much . __eou__ That's true . __eou__
I feel absolutely horrible . My temperature is 41 degrees Celsius , and I've got a headache and a runny nose . __eou__ do you have any other symptoms ? __eou__ I've also got a terrible stomach-ache . Is my face still swollen ? __eou__ just a little . Has your toothache gone now ? __eou__ yes , for the most part . It doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments , anyway . __eou__ how about your tongue ? Does it still hurt ? __eou__ no , the burn ointment seemed to take effect right away . I think it's already healed . __eou__ how did you get that burn again ? __eou__ I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago . __eou__ you haven't had much luck lately , have you ? __eou__ no , but I'm sure I'll get better soon . __eou__ when's the last time you took your tablets ? __eou__ I took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch . __eou__ I think it's time you took another does of each . What would you like to drink with them ? __eou__ just some water , please . Do you have any ointment for my nose ? It feels so itchy after blowing my nose so much . __eou__ sure , I'll just go and get it now . what would you like to eat ? Some soup ? __eou__ that sounds good . __eou__ soup always makes me feel better when I'm sick . I hope it makes you feel better , too . __eou__
I haven't got enough evidence for prosecuting him . __eou__ Why don't you find someone who is in the know . __eou__ I'm just thinking about that , but the trouble is , I don't know who is well in the know . __eou__ Did you ask his former secretary , Lora ? She knows a lot about him . __eou__ Thanks for reminding me . She's the right person to help me . __eou__
What are you two doing in here ? __eou__ We heard you weren't feeling well , so we came to check on you . __eou__ I was sitting there giving out nametags and all of a sudden , there she was . __eou__ Who , Femi ? Yeah , Yi-jun saw her inside . __eou__ All these memories of prom night came back to me . I had to be alone . You remember that night ? __eou__ I remember someone spiked my punch . You sat with me in the girl's bathroom ... __eou__
You're not looking happy.What ' s the matter ? __eou__ Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired . __eou__ With the job ? __eou__ With everything , with everybody , with all this ! __eou__ A good suggestion for you.You need a holiday . __eou__ It wasn't always like this , you know . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I mean.We always do the same thing.There ' s no variety in our lives . __eou__ You need a holiday.That ' s what's the matter . __eou__ Certainly , perhaps . __eou__
Oh dear , Miss , you are soaked ! Wow , it's really raining heavily outside . __eou__ Yes , it sure is . I had to run here from work ! I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break . __eou__ Well please , why don't you go ahead of me in line ? I'm in no hurry . __eou__ Oh , that's so nice of you ! Thank you very much . __eou__ My pleasure Miss . Actually , could you recommend what to eat here ? I've never been here before . __eou__ Sure . Well , the avocado sandwich is delicious , and it's the healthiest thing on the menu . Personally , I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice . I usually get that . Also , the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town ! __eou__ Well , thanks for the suggestions . __eou__ Oh , don't mention it . __eou__
Dad , what's the date ? __eou__ It's December eighteenth . __eou__ In seven days it will be Christmas Day . __eou__ Yes , I know that . __eou__ So , can I buy some new shoes as a Christmas present ? __eou__ Sure , a promise is a promise . __eou__
What happen , John ? __eou__ Nothing . __eou__ Why do you look unhappy ? __eou__ I ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off . __eou__ Oh , cheer up . He ’ ll understand you . __eou__
This man is your fiance , Dolly ? __eou__ Yeah , how do you like him ? __eou__ He's handsome . __eou__ Can you give me a touch of his character ? __eou__ He's outgoing and honest , but sometimes he's a bit conservative . __eou__
Do you think I should buy this now and bring it with us ? __eou__ Don't bother . those are a dime a dozen where we are going . __eou__
Brooke , are you still mad ? Is your mom mad ? __eou__ No ... mom said that we'll have the wedding at home on the 2nd . So let's hope your mom is right about that being a lucky day ... __eou__ It will be . And today is , too . I just talked to the airlines ... __eou__ They're going to give us back the seats ? __eou__ No , they're giving us discount tickets on a honeymoon package in ... __eou__ Hawaii ? My dream honeymoon destination ? __eou__ You got it ! We'll fly there directly from Texas . __eou__ Oh , Jack ! That's wonderful ! __eou__
The world changes , the family changes too . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ People now like a small family composed of two parents and one child . __eou__ That is called a nuclear family . __eou__ I don't like such a family . __eou__ What kind of family are you like ? __eou__ I like a family composed of many people . It includes grandparents , parents , aunts and uncles , and children . __eou__ It's a traditional family . It may be too large to live well . __eou__ We can live well , I think . __eou__
What was that all about ? __eou__ We had a difference of opinion . __eou__ Is she going to be okay ? __eou__ She'll be fine . __eou__
Is sailing fun ? __eou__ You bet ! __eou__
John dates her seven times a week . __eou__ Really ? That's a straws in the wind . __eou__ I think so . Maybe he's fallen for her . __eou__ Yeah . They suit each other . A perfect match between a man and a girl . __eou__ Right . __eou__
I was told my friend Joe was speaking ill of me . That's a real let-down . __eou__ I don't think Joe has done such a thing . Don't believe things in haste . __eou__ Maybe I should go and ask him whether it's true . __eou__
Good morning , Loans . __eou__ Good morning , Mr . Smith . __eou__ I would like to compliment you on your diligence . __eou__ Well , thank you , Mr . Smith . But I was just doing my job . __eou__ Yes . And we're proud of you , Loans . __eou__ It's nice of you to say so . __eou__
Which countries have you been to ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been to most of the countries in Europe , several countries in asia-china , Japan , korea , and Thailand-and to the united states and Canada . __eou__ I thought you had been to Australia too . __eou__ No , but I ’ m planning on visiting Australia and new Zealand soon . I ’ Ve heard that they are beautiful countries . Which is the most beautiful country you ’ Ve been to ? __eou__ I think I ‘ d say norway . It has many picturesque fjords , waterfalls , and mountains . __eou__ Isn ’ t it really cold there ? __eou__ Well , the north of Norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . It ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter . __eou__ I ’ Ve been to other Scandinavian countries , but not to Norway . Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there . __eou__
Alison , would you like to have some more ? __eou__ No thanks . I have had enough . __eou__ Actually you haven't have much . __eou__ To tell you the truth , I am on the diet . __eou__ That sounds ridiculous . Why ? __eou__ Well , I am gaining weight these days , and I have to watch my calories . __eou__
Welcome to my birthday party , I am so happy you can come . __eou__ Thanks for inviting me . Here is the gift for you . Happy birthday , Francis ! Many more happy and healthy years for you ! __eou__ Thank you , shall I open it now ? __eou__ Yes , please do . __eou__ Wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . I really like it . That is so nice of you . __eou__ Yeah , I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car . It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself . __eou__ Typical you , always wanting to keep the best things for yourself . The more I appreciate the gift now . __eou__
Did you read the news that ' China's property prices rose at the fastest pace in 18 months in December , ending the year with rising fears of bubbles in the property market ' ? __eou__ No . Does the newspaper say what has caused that ? __eou__ Yes . It says the hike was a result of purchase rush in the fourth quarter on expectations of tightening politics . __eou__ I think the government should make a serves of moves to cool the market . __eou__ Right . The climbing property prices has become a headache for Chinese residents . __eou__
I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They ’ re famous , so everyone loves them . __eou__ I think they must have horrible lives . All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . They must get sick of it . __eou__ I bet they love it really . Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films . __eou__ No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ’ t even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party . __eou__ Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ’ s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and a t-shirt , but they can ’ t because their managers force them to wear clothes they don ’ t like . __eou__ I don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ’ re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored . __eou__ I think you should give them some credit . They ’ re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves . __eou__ Come on ! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves 。 __eou__
Hi , it is a pleasant surprise ! __eou__ Yeah , it ’ s been ages ! So how have you been ? __eou__ Couldn ’ t be better . And you ? __eou__ Just as usual , you know . __eou__
Hey , Mary , can you cut that out ? __eou__ Cut what out I ’ m not doing anything . __eou__ The tapping of your pen on your desk . It ’ s driving me crazy . __eou__ Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup ! __eou__ I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ? __eou__ You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? __eou__ Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are . __eou__ Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down . __eou__ Yeah , I ’ ll try to do the same . So , I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night ? __eou__
The weather in Beijing is just beautiful ! __eou__ Autumn is the best season in Beijing , you know . __eou__ Yes , I can see . The summer heat is over , and the winter cold is still far away . __eou__ What is the weather like in Washington at this time of this year ? __eou__ Autumn is also very nice in Washington . __eou__ Is it very cold in winter there ? __eou__ No , it isn't . But sometimes it snows a lot in winter . __eou__ Does it rain a lot in summer there ? __eou__ Oh yes ! Sometimes it rains very heavily.How about here in Beijing ? __eou__ There's a lot of rain in summer , but it seldom rains in autumn . __eou__ I feel it's rather dry here . __eou__ That's true . Many people from the south don't like the weather here . __eou__ Are you from the south ? __eou__ No , I'm from the north . I was born in Beijing , actually . __eou__ I see.so this is your hometown ? __eou__
Mike , come and look at this painting of shrimp ! It is so simple yet so vivid ! __eou__ Yeah . It is incredible ! Is it the work of Qi Bakshi ? __eou__ Yes , it is . How do you know that ? __eou__ Well , Qi is famous all over the world , isn ’ t he ? Besides I am quite interested in Chinese painting . __eou__ Cool ! What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer , free sketch or claborate-style painting ? __eou__ I prefer free sketch , especially the landscape paintings . I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings . __eou__ That's true . Chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature , which is an important part of China's traditional culture . __eou__ I love this art exhibition ! __eou__ So do I . Let ’ s go to other areas to see what they have got , shall we ? __eou__ OK . __eou__
Lousy weather , isn't it ? __eou__ It has stopped snowing , but it's even colder . __eou__ Look at the ice there hanging from the eaves . __eou__ And the streets are covered with snow . __eou__ Do you know what the temperature is today ? __eou__ I missed today's weather forecast over the TV . __eou__ It feels like ten degrees below zero at least . I don't mind the cold weather but I do hate it when it gets slippery . __eou__ The ice will soon be thick enough for skating . I am so fond of winter sports . __eou__ That's great . Let's go skating together tomorrow . __eou__
Nick , it's very nice of you to see me off . __eou__ You're welcome . Did you have a good time on this vacation ? __eou__ Very well . If I leave I'll miss you . __eou__ Me too . Please write to me as soon as you get Boston . __eou__ I'm sure and I remembered your phone number . I'll call you . __eou__ OK , they begin to register . __eou__ It's time I left . __eou__ Have a nice journey ! Do give my regards to your parents . __eou__
What are your working hours ? __eou__ Eight to twelve in the morning , two to six in the afternoon . __eou__ Much better than mine . __eou__ What are your hours ? __eou__ Mine aren't fixed . Sometimes I do the day shift , sometimes the night shift . __eou__
Would it be all right if I went home next weekend ? __eou__ For What ? __eou__ Well , I want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday . __eou__ Well , that sounds like it would be OK . Just be careful . __eou__
Could you tell me what university you went to , Mr . Smith ? __eou__ I went to Yale University . __eou__ Did you ? And what did you study ? __eou__ I have a B . A . in Economics . __eou__ Would you mind telling me how old you are ? __eou__ I'm twenty-seven . __eou__ And could you tell me what other jobs you have had ? __eou__ Yes , I have worked in a bank for the last years . __eou__ And what was your salary at the bank ? __eou__ I got $ 500 a week . __eou__
Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ? __eou__ I'm all right , thanks . Just a little tired . __eou__ Late night ? __eou__ Yeah , I got home around two . __eou__
I am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year , what do you say ? __eou__ Fantastic ! I enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette . __eou__ How did that happen ? __eou__ A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face . __eou__ Sounds cool ! But that is not what a lady should do . People are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk . __eou__
What do you do for a living ? __eou__ I ’ m a doctor . __eou__ Really ? Do you like it ? __eou__ Yes , I do . It ’ s very interesting . What ’ s your job ? __eou__ I ’ m a bus driver . __eou__ Oh , do you enjoy it ? __eou__ No , I don ’ t really like it . It ’ s boring . __eou__
what a nice garden ! Look at these tulips ! __eou__ that would be a good shot . Can you take my picture here , dear ? Please try to get the garden in the frame as well . __eou__ all right . Would you please stand closer to the flower bed ? Good . Smile . Say " cheese " . OK , got you . That's terrific . __eou__ thanks . Could you take one more from this angle ? __eou__ no problem . __eou__ now let's have one together . __eou__ do you know how to set the timer ? __eou__ let me see ... set the timer first and push the button , oh , come here . __eou__ OK , let's have a try . __eou__ cheese ... __eou__ did it come out ? __eou__ yes , but it's blurred and a little dark . __eou__ never mind . Let's go to the falls and try again . __eou__ Ok , let's go . __eou__

I wanted to but my wife preferred to see the old film . __eou__ What a pity . It was quite exciting . Both teams played very well . __eou__ How did it finish ? __eou__ It finished in a draw . What was the film like ? __eou__ It was quite good . But . I missed the beginning of it because I had to eat first . __eou__ Did your wife enjoy it ? __eou__ No , she didn't . After half an hour she stopped watching and started to read a book . __eou__

I am sure things will turn note , ok ? __eou__ I am not . she is no picnic . __eou__ Well . if you think I can help , let me know . __eou__ Thanks , Serena . __eou__

What a nice day ! Why don't we go for an outing ? __eou__ Sure.Where would you suggest ? __eou__ How about going to the suburbs ? __eou__ Sounds good . __eou__
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? __eou__ Sorry , I thought you knew . __eou__ But you should have told me you were in love with her . __eou__ Didn't I ? __eou__ You know you didn't . __eou__ Well , I'm telling you now . __eou__ Yes , but you might have told me before . __eou__ I didn't think you'd be interested . __eou__ You can't be serious .

Where's Tom this evening ? __eou__ He's a little sick under the weather . __eou__ Really ! What's the matter with him ? __eou__ He has the flu . __eou__ Tell him I was asking about him . __eou__ I will . __eou__
Maybe you should talk to the teacher . __eou__ No , it's no use . __eou__ You never know unless you try . __eou__ I know . She won't change my grade . __eou__
well , I finished my last final today . __eou__ the end of all the hard work for my master's . what a nice feeling to get my degree ! __eou__ do you want to attend the convocation ? __eou__ certainly . After years of hard work , I wouldn't miss it . By the way , where can I find cap and gown ? __eou__ do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them ? __eou__ oh , I think they're provided by the school for that special day . __eou__ no . those you have to provide for yourself . __eou__ what do most of the students do ? __eou__ well , most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service , but some of the education majors have had them made , because they will be faculty members , and they'll need them f __eou__ then , I might as well have them made . __eou__ Mary , don't move . Stand right there . It's a good shot . The background is very pretty . __eou__ hold it a second . I want to fix my hairpin . __eou__ it doesn't matter . Say'cheese ' . __eou__ here's Lisa . May I take a picture with her ? __eou__ Certainly . Ok , got you . __eou__
Do you mind if I ask you a question ? __eou__ No , not at all . Go ahead . __eou__ What do you do in order to improve your English ? __eou__ I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things . Most importantly , I practice every chance I get . __eou__ It ’ s a good idea to have a radio , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Sure . It ’ s like understanding on the telephone — — you can ’ t see the speaker ! It ’ s great for improving listening comprehension . __eou__ It takes a long time to learn a language , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ It certainly does . But if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress . __eou__
Good morning , Sue . __eou__ Good morning , Tom.How are you ? __eou__ I'm fine , thanks , how about yourself ? __eou__ Things couldn't be better.Where are you going now ? __eou__ I am heading for the library .

Is the environment a big issues in your country ? It is in mine . __eou__ It is in mine too.The biggest issue is water . The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important . __eou__ What methods do you use to conserve water ? __eou__ Water is rationed . We can only use a certain amount each month . It means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . They use too much water . __eou__ I see . I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . __eou__ Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . __eou__ We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . __eou__ The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don ’ t believe that any single country can do anything about it . __eou__ I think you ’ re right . There needs to be an international response to this problem . __eou__
Hurry up . Time is running out . __eou__ I see . I have run as fast as I can . __eou__
Hi Cody , how did practicing go this week ? __eou__ Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn ’ t get a chance to memorize the second page , but I think I mastered the tricky section . __eou__ Great ! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . Good , good . This week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let ’ s take a look at this __eou__ Charles ? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ? __eou__ It might work . I ’ ll have to hear it.Show me what you ’ Ve done . __eou__ It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home ! __eou__ It ’ s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ’ t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp b __eou__ Is that better ? __eou__ Yes , much better . Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . What was that ? __eou__ Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make . __eou__ That's ok , keep going , you ’ re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics ! Keep your elbows lifted . Remember to stroke the keys , don ’ t pound . That ’ s better ! Remember that as a pianist or any __eou__
Can you tell me the time ? __eou__ It's 5:30 by my watch . __eou__ Is your watch right ? __eou__ Yes . There's only a few seconds in a whole month . __eou__
I heard that you're going on your first date Friday night . __eou__ Are you angry , Lisa ? __eou__ Angry ? Why would I be ? __eou__ Please don't tell my mom . __eou__ Come on . Dating is a part of young people's social life . Besides , you're sixteen already . __eou__ I'm glad that you see it that way . __eou__ Do you want to borrow my coat ? I have a black coat that would look smashing on you . __eou__ Thank you so much , Lisa ! __eou__
Hi , Mary , long time no see . __eou__ I heard through the grapevine that your getting married . __eou__ Yes , next March . __eou__ Congratulations , I hope everything works out . __eou__
Jim and you are bosom friends , aren't you ? __eou__ I wouldn't say so . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I thought he was , but he ends up to be a con man . __eou__
is everything alright ? __eou__ yes , everything is fine . __eou__ what took so long ? I thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago ! __eou__ didn't they announce that our flight was delayed ? __eou__ I didn't hear anything about a delay . I thought everything was running on time . What happened ? __eou__ we boarded the plane on time , but then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem . __eou__ then what ? Your plane was three hours late ! __eou__ we finally took off , but about 30 minutes later , the captain came on the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight . __eou__ turbulence is pretty normal , isn't it ? __eou__ yes , but this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life ! Everyone started getting sick . The flight attendants had to stay in their seats . The captain decided to land early . __eou__ so where did you land ? __eou__ we landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again . __eou__ that sounds like a nightmare ! __eou__ it wasn't too bad . At lease I'm alive . __eou__ have you had anything to eat ? __eou__ I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant . How about you ? __eou__ I had a few coffees while I was waiting . Let's get out of here ! __eou__
I've got some bad news about the bike you lent me . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ I fell on the way to school , and your bike got scratched . I'm really sorry . __eou__ Don't worry about it . It's not new , it already has a few scratches . Did you get hurt ? __eou__ No , thank you . __eou__ That's the most important thing . __eou__ It's kind of you to say . I feel a little stupid . __eou__ Forget about it . __eou__ When you lent me the bike , it looked brand new , almost anyway . __eou__ Maybe , but really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well . __eou__ I appreciate that , thank you . __eou__
What date is it today ? __eou__ Today is December 23,2002 . __eou__ Oh , the day after tomorrow is Christmas . __eou__ Merry Christmas to you ! __eou__
Hello ! I'm Penny , I moved here just now . __eou__ Oh , Penny , I'm Leonard , glad to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you , too . I thought I should come and say hello to you . I haven't known anybody . __eou__ It is hard to get used to a new place , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes . Would you like to come here later to have a coffee ? Bring all your family . __eou__ We'd like to . Can you tell me when we go ? __eou__ About 4 . __eou__ OK . Do you want us to bring something ? __eou__ No , just come here . __eou__ OK , see you later . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
You know what , last night I almost got hit by a vase falling from the third floor . __eou__ Oh , how dreadful ! I ’ m ever so sorry . __eou__ Luckily that was nothing serious . __eou__ Thank God ! __eou__
I do feel like a trip to Florida on such a gloomy day in New York , to enjoy the sunshine while lying on the beaches of Florida . __eou__ That's a great idea . It's the best season for tourists in Florida . You can also get a good sun-tan there . __eou__ But if the sunshine is too strong , it might damage the eyes and the skin . __eou__ You can put on your shades . And remember don't make your skin look like a tomato . Or else after that your skin will begin to flake off . You may even wind up with skin cancer . __eou__ I see . Overdoing it will do more harm than good . __eou__ You said it . __eou__
I just finished reading this article ' Getting Old Gracefully ' . It's a very good article . __eou__ What does it say ? __eou__ A lot of things . There is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . You really should read it . __eou__ Thank you . But I don't think I'll bother . __eou__ Why not ? What this article says makes good sense to me . If you read it , I'm sure you'll agree with me . __eou__ I don't think I'll have any trouble with getting old . But perhaps you can keep the article for a while , I may read it later . __eou__
Thanks for coming shopping with me . __eou__ I'm so honored that you thought to ask me . __eou__ I've never given a speech in front of a thousand people before . __eou__ You're going to do great . And you're going to look great . __eou__ Thanks . Now let's decide which one of these suits looks best for this occasion . __eou__ I still like the olive one best . There's a tailor here who can take up the sleeves for you . __eou__ The question is , can he have it done before Friday ? __eou__ These guys are professional . I think they can have it done tomorrow . Let's ask . __eou__
I love slim girls , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Not particularly . I like fat girls . __eou__ And I like a girl with good skin , do you ? __eou__ I can ’ t say I do . What I like a girl with good manners . __eou__ Well , yes . But surely you like a girl with a nice figure . __eou__ Yes . But I like a girl with a nice personality . __eou__ But you like a girl to be rich , surely ? __eou__ Not particularly . I like a girl to be good . __eou__
What's going on here ? __eou__ We're waiting in line to get one of Master Li's Chinese couplets . I got one last year and I had good luck all year ! __eou__ Master Li ? Who's that ? __eou__ He's Taipei's most famous calligraphy master ! Quick ! Get in line ! __eou__ I will ! I could use some good luck ! __eou__
I suppose you like cinematography and costumes and that sort of stuff ? __eou__ Yes , I do . The look of a picture is very important . __eou__ I think sound is even more important ! Guns , bombs , sirens--that's what makes a movie exciting ! __eou__ You wouldn't know a good movie even if it bit you on the nose . __eou__ In my book , all a good movie needs is a chase scene and lots of things that blow up . __eou__ Enough ! If we don't finish the game , there won't be time for any movies tonight ! __eou__
What day is today ? __eou__ It's Thursday , I think . __eou__ Tomorrow is Friday . It's going to be the weekend . __eou__ We're busy on weekdays , but we'll have a good rest at the weekend . __eou__ We'll meet again in a few days . __eou__
I decided to go for this kind of life . __eou__ Try to keep cool . It's not an easy take . __eou__ I know . I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst . __eou__ Then you will be in line for a doom . __eou__
What day is it today ? __eou__ It's Friday . __eou__
Are you new to this school ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m new . __eou__ Is this your first year in college ? __eou__ I transferred from another school . __eou__ Where did you transfer from ? __eou__ I was at PCC before . __eou__ Why did you transfer ? __eou__ I was going to go here first , but my grades weren ’ t good enough . __eou__ Did you like it at PCC ? __eou__ PCC is an incredible school . __eou__ Well , I wish you luck here . __eou__ I ’ m sure I ’ ll like it here . __eou__
There is something wrong with my girlfriend . __eou__ What's the trouble ? __eou__ The department manager is all over her . He says he loves her . __eou__ What about your friend ? Did she fall for him ? __eou__ Of course not ! She thinks he's an apple-head . She doesn't like an apple-headed man , you know . __eou__ Now you don't have the butterflies in your stomach , do you ? __eou__
Are you ready to go to the bank ? __eou__ Sure , what do you need to do there ? __eou__ There ’ s problem with my bank statement . There ’ s a mistake on it . I also need to withdraw some money some the ATM . __eou__ I have to exchange some money . __eou__ that ’ s right . You ’ re going away next week . __eou__ I also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . There was a problem last week . __eou__ I have to pay my credit bill too . If I don ’ t pay it soon , the credit card company will charge me interest . __eou__ Their interest rates are usually quite high . It ’ s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest . __eou__
It ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean . __eou__ would you like to live in the country ? I ’ m not sure I ’ d like it . __eou__ I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The two just don ’ t go together . __eou__ I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities . __eou__ People can ’ t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , but there ’ s more to do . __eou__ I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings . __eou__ I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes . __eou__ The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ’ s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful . __eou__ Just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . There ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . There ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods . __eou__ You ’ re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country ! __eou__
Hey Mike . What are you doing ? __eou__ Nothing much . What are you up to ? __eou__ I was just concerned about Sam . He hasn't been himself lately . __eou__ He took the civil service exam and failed . __eou__ That sucks . He must feel depressed . __eou__ Yeah . He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days . __eou__ Why don't we take him out ? We can try to take his mind off of it . In the least show him that we're there for him . __eou__ That's a great idea . Why don't you call him . I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else . __eou__ Ok . I'll call you back after I'm done . __eou__ Sounds good . __eou__
Did you hear Peter just retired ? __eou__ Are you sure ? He is quite young , isn't he ? __eou__ He is not young as he looks . I think he's almost sixty . __eou__ Really ? He looks so young . __eou__
Hello , Steven . Congratulations ! __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ How's your married life ? __eou__ We're happy together now . We both think that we're a well-matched couple . __eou__ That's very good . It's said that marriage is the Ab of love . But the words may not be right . __eou__ The situation differs in person . __eou__
We have waited for a long time . When will we start ? __eou__ Take it easy . I have to cut my losses . __eou__
are you working overtime again ? Over the last two weeks , you have worked overtime every day without a break ! Your company is draining the life out of you ! __eou__ I know , but I don't have a choice , my boss has complete control over our work schedules . I haven't made it out of the office before 9 PM a single day this week . __eou__ Well , I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work ... __eou__ No , not exactly , I'm working for minimum wage.And they don't give extra pay for overtime . Overtime is our own time . __eou__ What ? ! Isn't there a law against that , I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . You should know your rights ! If you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation . __eou__ They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it's not much of an incentive . They give us a bonus of ten dollars . __eou__ That's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ? __eou__ I would , but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job . I don't have very many job marketable skills , there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for . __eou__ it sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now ! __eou__
The tranquility of the night , the chirping of some insects , everything is so natural ! __eou__ I felt as if I had been in a different world . __eou__ And I was overwhelmed by this scene , too . __eou__
I'd like to reserve a table for three at 6:30 this evening . __eou__ Let me check . Hold on , please ... Yes , that's fine . Smoking or nonsmoking area ? __eou__ Nonsmoking , please . __eou__ All right . May I have your name ? __eou__ My surname is Gao . __eou__ How do you spell it , sir ? __eou__
OK . Come back into the classroom , class . __eou__ Does the class start again , Mam ? __eou__ Yes , but to the health , this break has long enough . __eou__ Oh , breaktime flies . __eou__ come on , baby . It ’ s time now . __eou__ Mam , another minute , could I ? __eou__ Hurry up , little boy . __eou__
why are you so upset today , Maria ? Cheer up ! __eou__ oh , Iris , it ’ s about the job with the PR company . __eou__ it ’ s a great opportunity . You should be happy with the offer . __eou__ but my mother won ’ t allow me to accept any part-time job . I ’ m afraid she will say no again . __eou__ why ? It ’ s unfair . You can learn a lot from it . __eou__ she says a part-time job is cursed blessing . It takes so much time and energy that I won ’ t be able to focus on my studys . __eou__ that may be true . But I ’ m sure you ’ re able to find a balance between them . Why not try it ? __eou__ I turned down quite a few offers before for her sake . But I ’ m a senior now , I don ’ t want to miss the chance this time . __eou__ I agree with you but I think you really need to talk to your mother and tell her what's on your mind . __eou__ I ’ ll try , but what if she insists ? __eou__ just let her know that the experience will be both amazing and rewarding . And more importantly , you can manage both your study and the job . __eou__ do you think it will work ? __eou__ sure . Every cloud has its silver lining . Just try . __eou__ ok , I ’ ll do that . Thank you , Iris . __eou__ sure . Good luck , Maria ! __eou__
Where did you go yesterday ? __eou__ I went to play tennis in the public park . __eou__ How often do you play tennis ? __eou__ Twice a week . How about you ? __eou__ I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball . __eou__ What is very difficult to gather team player together . __eou__ I usually play with my school-mates . __eou__ Do you like watching football matches ? __eou__ Yes . I went to Tinge Sport Centre for football match last Sunday . __eou__
Why are you all dressed up ? __eou__ I've got a date . __eou__
I ’ m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office . __eou__ Why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ? __eou__ What do you suggest ? I can ’ t afford to quit my job until I get a new one . __eou__ Maybe you have two choices . You could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training . __eou__
I saw an interesting program on TV last night . It was about elderly people . __eou__ And what did the program say ? __eou__ It said that people with a positive attitude tend to live longer and happier . __eou__ I think that many physicians now agree with that idea . __eou__ And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress . __eou__ And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day . __eou__
Saying you want to kill yourself , you terrified me out of my wits . __eou__ I was playing a joke on you . __eou__ That ’ s too much . __eou__ Dear , forgive me . I won ’ t do that again . __eou__
Where are you going this weekend ? __eou__ I ’ m going to Hainan . __eou__ Oh really ? It ’ ll be nice and warm there . Have you been there before ? __eou__ Yes , actually it ’ s my second visit . I was there last October . __eou__ I see . What ’ s it like there ? __eou__ Well , the life style is much more relaxed than here in the city . And the seafood is tastier ! __eou__ Well , have a great time ! __eou__
Hurry up , Daniel , it's Barbie time . __eou__ All right , Sis ! __eou__ Come on , it's cool outside . __eou__ I really wish Mom and Dad were here with us . __eou__ Hey , Daniel , what's your favorite weather ? Snowy or sunny ? __eou__ Me ? Er , I like hot weather , just like today . __eou__ What ? Are you crazy ? __eou__ I like to watch Barbie sticking her tongue out . __eou__ Ew , Danny , gross ! __eou__ By the way , what's your favorite weather ? __eou__ I love snowy , because it is very very romantic . __eou__ Look , is that Tom ? __eou__
My girlfriend dumped me . __eou__ Well , that's life . __eou__
Did Roll win the race ? __eou__ Yeah , he did . But he only won it by a hair's breadth . __eou__ But anyway , he won at last . __eou__ Yeah . To win is the most important thing . __eou__
What's this then ? __eou__ It's my geography , sir.The Map of Africa you set us . __eou__ But this should have been handed in last Thursday . __eou__ Yes , I know , sir . I'm sorry . __eou__ Well , what's your excuse then ? __eou__ My mother's been ill and I had to stay at home . __eou__ Oh , Yes ? __eou__ It's true , sir . __eou__
Hey , This is your order . __eou__ Are you new here ? I come to this coffeehouse often . But I didn't see you here before . __eou__ Yes . I started this part-time job just three days ago . And my internship will last 1 week . I'm still a student now . __eou__ Do you mind if I ask you why you've taken the part-time job here ? __eou__ Of course not . You know , there are many foreign customers like you here . And I think it's good for me to improve my oral English . __eou__ Oh , are you an English student ? Or you just study English for interest's sake ? __eou__ No , I'm not an English student . But I do like English . I'm going to be a volunteer in the 2008 Olympics where I want to be helpful with the language . So I try to improve my English . __eou__ Very nice . Thank you for your time . __eou__ Thank you , sir . But I'm not allowed to accept any tips . __eou__ OK then . I don't want to put you in trouble . __eou__ Well , would you like something else ? The new-made cafe parfait is really good . Want some ? __eou__ OK . But I'd like some cookies . __eou__ Sure . If you want more coffee , please go over there . There is self-help coffee maker . __eou__ I surely know that . Don't forget that I am a regular customer here . __eou__ Oops . Well , wait for a while . We'll get it done quickly . __eou__ It's OK . Thank you . __eou__
Do you think the bad weather will last long ? __eou__ I don't think so . It changes so quickly this time . __eou__ I hope so . We have planed to visit the square but we have to cancel it . __eou__ I think you can go to visit the museum . It's worth seeing . You can go to the square some other time . __eou__ Good idea . Thanks a billion . __eou__
Let's go in . __eou__ After you . __eou__
Could you tell me what university you want to go to , John ? __eou__ Pardon ? __eou__ What university would you enter ? __eou__ University ? Why ? You asked me last year . __eou__ Oh , I forget . Sorry . __eou__ I went to Harvard University . __eou__ Did you ? And what course did you take there ? __eou__ God save me ! Is there anything wrong with you ? Didn't I tell you ? __eou__ I've not known . Perhaps , I've got a bad memory . __eou__ I did a B . A . in economics . Remember ? __eou__ Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A . __eou__
I think he deserved his gold . __eou__ Did you see his last dive ? __eou__ Yes , it's perfect ! __eou__ He's diving for the gold . __eou__
You are studying here , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . I have been here for three years . __eou__ Do you like this campus ? __eou__ Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected . __eou__ Oh.It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped . __eou__ I ’ ll just have to put up with it . __eou__
How I wish my son Mark could be as excellent as your Joe ! __eou__ Don ’ t be too humble . Few young men could be equal to Mark . And in some respects Joe and Mark are neck and neck . __eou__ I agree . Both Joe and Mark are men of guts . __eou__
Hi Mark . __eou__ Hi . __eou__ What are you planning to do today ? __eou__ I'm not sure yet . __eou__ Would you like to have lunch with me ? __eou__ Yes . When ? __eou__ Is 11:30 AM OK ? __eou__ Sorry , I didn't hear you . Can you say that again please ? __eou__ I said , 11:30 AM . __eou__ Oh , I'm busy then . Can we meet a little later ? __eou__ OK , how about 12:30 PM ? __eou__ OK . Where ? __eou__ How about Bill's Seafood Restaurant ? __eou__ Oh , Where is that ? __eou__ It's on 7th Street . __eou__ OK , I'll meet you there . __eou__
How have you been ? __eou__ Fine , thanks . How about you ? __eou__
Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company . __eou__ Thank you , I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it . __eou__ You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ? __eou__ Well , yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions . __eou__ Now , the effort pays off . You have accomplished something . __eou__ Come on , don ’ t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ’ t get this turned around without the support from you people . __eou__
I hate to say goodbye , but it's late . __eou__ Can't you stay for a little bit longer , it's only 8 . __eou__ I wish I could.But I'm afraid I can't . I've got some serious studying to do . I have to go . __eou__ OK.See you on Today . __eou__ See you on Moday.Have a great weekend . __eou__ You too.Thanks for dropping in . __eou__
Are you really dating with Frank ? __eou__ Yeah . But in my heart of hearts , I find he ’ s not very much to my liking . __eou__ Then why not keep away from him ? __eou__ The problem is that I just have no one to turn to right now . __eou__ That ’ s stupid . __eou__
Hi , Jim . How are you ? I haven't seen you for a while . __eou__ I'm fine . I've been out of town . I just got back . __eou__ Where were you ? __eou__ I was in New York for a wedding . __eou__
What do you think of the novel you just finished reading ? __eou__ I like it a lot . It has a very funny beginning , I think . It attracts your attention the moment you begin reading it . __eou__ What do you like best about it ? __eou__ I like the plot . It's so full of twists and turns . I also like the main character . She is so humorous and smart . __eou__ What do you think of the ending ? __eou__ The ending is a bit weak . It's so abrupt , like those of most other detective stories . __eou__
Quite a few times , I had my back to the wall . __eou__ Really ? Generally they will turn out to be a good thing . __eou__ That ’ s right . __eou__ You ’ ll exert all your energy and get out of it . __eou__
Is that your phone ? __eou__ Yes , it's my new business phone . Do you like it ? __eou__ It's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ? __eou__ Yes , it's got wireless Internet access . __eou__ That's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ? __eou__ Yes , but I don't really use it often . Have you ever used it ? __eou__ No , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . __eou__ Yes , I guess I should try to use it . __eou__
Good morning , Mary ! __eou__ Good morning , John ! __eou__ I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ? __eou__ I'd be delighted to , John . Saturday did you say ? __eou__ Yes , if that's all right for you . __eou__ I'm pretty sure I'll be all right . In fact , I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you . What time are you planning to start ? __eou__ Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner . __eou__ That sounds fine . I'll be there around seven . __eou__
Don't worry . I'm sure you'll do better next time . __eou__ I didn't realize it was so difficult though I know I'm always too nervous in such competition . __eou__ It doesn't matter . Forget it . __eou__ I don't think I performed well . __eou__ Oh ! That's much hetter than I did . __eou__ Can you tell me how to improve myself ? __eou__ There's no secret at all . The only thing for you to do is to practice more . You will succeed . __eou__ Thank you for your encouragement . __eou__ It's a pleasure . Come on . I'm on your side . __eou__
I just dropped in to say goodbye . __eou__ What time are you leaving ? __eou__ I'll leave at 10 o'clock . __eou__ Take care and give my best to you parents . __eou__ Thank you , I will . Hope to see you again next year . __eou__
Come back . You haven't paid yet . __eou__ May , just let him go . __eou__ But he took some newspaper away without paying . __eou__ I know . __eou__ Why ? You make me confused . __eou__ He lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines , read the political sections and return them later . __eou__ Why does he have such a privilege ? __eou__ He used to be a hero during the war time and everyone respect him . __eou__ I see . Does he live by himself ? __eou__ Yes , he has no children and his wife passed away when he was in the battle . __eou__ He must be lonely ? __eou__ I bet . But he is always busy telling the children stories . __eou__ How respectable ! __eou__
How may I help you ? __eou__ I need to get on the Internet . __eou__ Do you have your library card with you ? __eou__ Yes , I have it . __eou__ You ’ re going to have to wait for a computer . __eou__ That ’ s okay . __eou__ Please put your name on this list . __eou__ Then what do I need to do ? __eou__ When there is a computer available , I will call you . __eou__ What do I do to log on to the computer ? __eou__ Just type in the number on the back of your library card . __eou__ Okay . Thanks for your help . __eou__
Are you coming to the bridal shower for Jane ? __eou__ Yes , I am . When is the wedding ? __eou__ Aug 8 . __eou__ August bride . How nice ! By the way , who is going to be the matron of honor ? __eou__ Mrs . White . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? I wonder who is going to give Jane away at the wedding . You know her father passed away several years ago . __eou__ Maybe her uncle will . __eou__ I think so . The wedding will be held at her church , right ? __eou__ Right . Red Rochester will officiate at the wedding . __eou__ Do you know where they will go on their honeymoon ? __eou__ Yes , Jane says they will go to China . __eou__
Don ’ t do that again . You are riding the tiger . __eou__ No problem . I can deal with it well . __eou__ You will ask for it . __eou__ All is best now , isn ’ t it ? __eou__
Hurry up ! Time is money ! __eou__ Don't build a fire under me . I know the importance of time . __eou__ But you are too slow to follow them . __eou__ Don't you see I'm trying my best ? __eou__
Watch out ! You'll hit that car if you're not careful . __eou__ Oh no , I won't . But we will have an accident if you don't stop shouting . __eou__ You see . I told you you'd hit him if you weren't careful . __eou__ Oh , shut up , will you ? It was all your fault.If you'd kept quite this would never have happened . __eou__ Oh , so it was my fault , was it ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse . __eou__
Steve , you look pale . What happened ? __eou__ I didn't sleep a wink last night . __eou__ Did you have something on your mind ? You look so concerned . Maybe I can help you . __eou__ Well , I am under a lot of pressure . My boss is very pushy . He assigned me three projects . Now the deadlines are near , and I still have not finished all of my projects . __eou__ Is there anything I can do to help you ? __eou__ Well , I guess no one can help me but myself . For the moment , I just need someone to talk to , so that I can relieve my stress . __eou__
Lodge , You must come around sometime , You have to check out my mew stereo . __eou__ Sure , When is good time for you ? __eou__ Can you make it on Tuesday ? __eou__ What time do you want me there ? __eou__ Anytime after six will be fine . __eou__ All right , It's a date . __eou__
My friend Jean is very beautiful . __eou__ What's her figure ? __eou__ Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too . __eou__ What's the color of her eyes ? __eou__ Dark blue . __eou__
What ’ s the life expectancy in your country ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? __eou__ About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world . __eou__ I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . __eou__ Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . __eou__ Did she ? That ’ s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment . __eou__ How ’ s your son these days ? __eou__ Oh , he ’ s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . __eou__ He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ? __eou__ I had mine when I was 24 . that ’ s a little young . I ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . __eou__ Yes , I think you ’ re right . I ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet . __eou__ Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ? __eou__ Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed . __eou__ Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom . __eou__ It ’ s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . __eou__
Hey Mike . I forgot about registration . I'm a day late , so all the classes are mostly full . What do you think I should do ? __eou__ You're screwed . You can't do anything about that . You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful . __eou__ Do you think going to the registration building will help at all ? __eou__ No . They will tell you the same thing in a worse way . __eou__ Did you register yet ? __eou__ Of course . Registering for classes is not something you want to miss . __eou__ What classes do you think are still open ? __eou__ Well , I know psychology 101 is a big class , so there will always be seats in that class . You can also get into Sociology . __eou__ That's helpful . Thanks . But what do you think about philosophy . I wanted to take that class this semester . __eou__ I took that class last year . The professor is really cool , so if you go to his office , you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full . __eou__ He does that ? __eou__ I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class . __eou__ That makes sense . I think I'll do that . Thanks for all the help . __eou__ No problem , man . __eou__
Thanks for helping me move into my new house . __eou__ Any time . I'm just glad I could help . __eou__
I've been so stressed these days . __eou__ What's the matter ? Are you OK ? __eou__ I don't know where to go for college , and what to major in . __eou__ Don't worry . You have plenty of time to decide . __eou__ And I also want to get scholarships to help me pay for the tuition . I want to get the burden off my family . __eou__ You always worry too much about everything . Take it easy , honey . You are good enough . You can go to the ideal college . __eou__ OK , OK . I'm so sorry . By the way , for you , is it more important to make money or to enjoy your work ? __eou__ In a perfect world , I would enjoy my work if I do not have to do much , and make lots of money ! __eou__ OK , honey , stop dreaming . You should face the reality . __eou__ That's only a joke . To be honest , I have to improve my English , because my English is not good enough . I still get confused about some simple grammars . Since you are quite good at it , do you have any suggestions ? __eou__ En , first you should be concentrated on what the teacher said in class . Second , I suggest you to take an additional course in some training center . __eou__ Is the training center helpful ? __eou__ I think so . Because I've taken one to improve my oral English during summer vacation . __eou__
I'm glad we live in a small town . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because the houses look so nice at Christmas time . __eou__ Yes , they do . Do you have a Christmas tree this year ? __eou__ Yes , we have a big tree this year . I bought the decorations at the five-and-tencent store yesterday . Do you want to come and see it ? __eou__ I can't now because I have to buy a present for my mother . __eou__ When can you come ? __eou__ I don't know when I can come . I'll let you know later . __eou__
You know , smoking does do harm to your health . __eou__ Yes , you're right . __eou__ Why don't you try to give it up ? __eou__ I've tried to give up smoking several times , but it's no good . Smoking relaxes me . __eou__ Have you ever thought of just cutting down ? You could do it gradually . __eou__ Yes , maybe I should have another try . __eou__
Hello , Jim . What was the film like ? __eou__ Awful . It was a complete waste of time . __eou__ Why ? What was it about ? __eou__ It was about a married couple . They had to live with the wife's mother , because they didn't have enough money to buy a house of their own . __eou__ A lot of young people have to do that . __eou__ Yes . but the husband had to work overtime three times a week , so he was always tired . __eou__ lt sounds like the story of my life . __eou__ Yes , it does , doesn't it ? But this man was always over-tired , and he couldn't sleep.So he used to take two sleeping pill every night . __eou__ I take sleeping pills sometimes . __eou__ Yes , but not two every night . Anyway , the strain was too much for him . He had nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital . __eou__ It sounds a very depressing film . __eou__ Not really . His wife was able to find a good job as an interpreter , because she could speak French and German fluently . After a few months ' work , she had a better job than her husband . So in the end , __eou__ I don't know . My wife used to speak French . I must tell her to brush it up . __eou__
Would you like to stretch your legs ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Let's get a soft drink . __eou__ Do we have enough time ? __eou__ It's a fifteen-minute intermission . __eou__ The seats are excellent . We're right in the center . __eou__ It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great . __eou__ I can't agree more . __eou__ Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert ? __eou__ In the United States , yes . But back in China , I went to concerts a couple of times with my parents . __eou__ Do you have large concert halls in your city ? __eou__ We have two . One is like this one . The other is a little smaller . __eou__ That's great . Well , we'd better get back to our seats . It's about to start . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ What time will the library be closing ? __eou__ It closes at six . __eou__ Does it always close at six ? __eou__ No , not every day . __eou__ Will the library be open on Saturday ? __eou__ Absolutely . __eou__ What are your hours on Saturday ? __eou__ Saturday ’ s hours are from nine in the morning to six-thirty at night . __eou__ All right .

Whose part do you think is best played ? __eou__ That of the old man . __eou__ You're absolutely right ! That's the very figure I like best . __eou__ Some of the scenes moved me into tears . __eou__
Vince , I think one of your programmers is spying on us for WebTracker . __eou__ Pardon ? __eou__ I won't say who , because I'm not sure yet . But I'll know soon . __eou__ Zina , I hope you're not scheming to make Elvin look bad . __eou__ It isn't Elvin . __eou__ Dave then ? Dave is a spy for WebTracker ? You can't be serious . __eou__ Loan me that tape recorder you have . And don't say anything to anyone until I come back . __eou__

What a great weekend that was ! __eou__ My feelings exactly . __eou__ I really enjoy the beach in the summer . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . __eou__ We should come here more often . __eou__ You are absolutely right . __eou__ I'd like to come back next weekend . __eou__ That's exactly the way I feel . __eou__
Aren ’ t you going to swim ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? Don't you know I can't swim ? __eou__ You are not telling me that we drove 50 miles to come here for just sunbath , are you ? __eou__ Hey , don't shout . Come here ! Sit closer . Now , Jim , we ’ Ve had a lovely day . Don't spoil it now . __eou__ What about your beautiful bathing suit ? We shopped all day . Don't you want to show it off ? __eou__ Everybody who walks past me sees it . Besides , it's a good sunbathing suit . __eou__ All right . Suit yourself . I am going swimming . __eou__ Jim ! __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ Can you get me a beach umbrella and a deck chair ? I am really tired of lying in thousand . __eou__ I've got a better idea .

That is the new classroom building for our senior high school . __eou__ Is there a swimming pool in your school ? __eou__ Yes . There is a large swimming pool , but it is only available in summer . __eou__ I do envy you . And I hope I can enter your school one day . __eou__ I believe that you can make your dream come true . __eou__
Television is undoubtedly a great invention , but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just aren't selective enough . Lesley , got a television . how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch ? __eou__ I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me , rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish . __eou__ Do you think of television though as a great time-waster ? __eou__ Un ... I think it can be a time-waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see ... Mm , it can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they're watching . __eou__ Aha , but how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get . . . get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things ... best programmes that ... that undoubtedly are on television ? __eou__ Well , I suppose one of the problems is ... will depend on what a person's life style is , and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television , he will then , you know , hmm . be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things . __eou__ Do you think though that ... that in . . . in a sense television skilled people's own er ... sort of , creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television ? __eou__ Yes , I think that is a danger , and I think that . . in fact is what mishappening to a lot of people who use it as their ... their main ... um field of amusement and ... because they don't have other outside interests and even when people come round they'll leave the television and not be , you know , particularly interested in talking to them , you Know the television will be the main thing in the room . __eou__
Don't be shy . Have some more chicken . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__

See you later ! __eou__ See you later ! Drive carefully . __eou__

Come in , come in , what can I do for you ? __eou__ Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ? __eou__ Yes , I am applying on it . __eou__ I wonder if I could enroll in it .

Management is going through a big turnover these days . With Bill's retirement , and department realignment , we have lost about 1/3 of our managerial staff . They've been dropping like flies ... __eou__ Isn't that a good thing ? Having fewer bosses means having less stress , don't you think ? __eou__ Actually , I don't think so . Supervisors are really important to make sure everything goes smoothly in the workplace . They are necessary for divvying up work and disciplining employees . If there is no one to keep an eye on us , no one would get any work done . You know what they say , when the cat's away , the mice play . __eou__ You're right , we do need leadership . But what we don't need is too many people to lead us . You know what they say about too many chiefs and not enough Indians ... __eou__ Alright ... I get your point . __eou__

We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! __eou__ Why can't we ? __eou__ It's an old superstition . If we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . Can Andy bring a date ? __eou__ I'm not sure . He just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon . __eou__ But we can't have thirteen for dinner ! __eou__ I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill .

Hi Mary , how's it going ? __eou__ Well , last night I had a big argument with Ann . __eou__ Terrible . It must be something serious . You two are such close friends . __eou__ Now that I look back at it , it wasn't that big a deal . I shouldn't have lost my temper . __eou__ Really ? What happened ? __eou__ It's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . Then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she need to cancel the trip . I was so angry when she told me that I said she didn't care about our friendship at all . __eou__ That's pretty harsh . __eou__ I know , but I was so upset . I mean , come on ! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ? __eou__ You know she probably feels just as bad . __eou__ Well , I think I was being a little selfish myself . I know they don't get to see each other very often . __eou__ Well , in that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding . You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . After all you can go to the beach anytime you want . __eou__ Yeah , I'll call later to patch things up . __eou__
I can't bear you anymore . I am sick of your drinking . I am divorcing you . __eou__ Don't do that to me , honey . Give me a chance , please .

Finally the class is over . Be quick . Ben must have been waiting for long . __eou__ Oh , I am so tired . My back is sore and my neck hurts . __eou__ That's normal .

He was extremely nervous then . __eou__ He lost a very good chance to go to college , didn't he ? __eou__ Yeah . The test was fairly easy and almost every test-taker could pass that exam . Adult College Entrance Exam is much easier than college entrance exam . And there are fewer subjects . __eou__ That's a very good lesson . We must familiarize ourselves with the exam from now on . __eou__
What did you do over the weekend ? __eou__ I went a global warming rally . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . __eou__ Do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? __eou__ It might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . __eou__ What else can we do to protect the environment ? __eou__ If you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . __eou__ How about recycling ? Does that actually help ? __eou__ Yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . __eou__ What do you think the biggest worry for our future is ? __eou__ I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . __eou__ I had no idea you were such an environmentalist before ! __eou__ To be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . __eou__
Merry Christmas , Bill ! __eou__ Merry Christmas . Steven ! __eou__ What do you want to do to celebrate Christmas ? __eou__ I'll have supper with my girlfriend and go shopping .

It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first ! __eou__ Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! __eou__ Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? __eou__ I might just !

Hey , Mike . You've been surfing the Net for quite a while . What on earth are you searching for ? __eou__ It's something relative hackers . I often hear people talking about them , but I don't know much about them . __eou__ Well , roughly speaking , a hacker is a computer buff . __eou__ You mean a guy using enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the computer ? __eou__ You can say that . __eou__ But why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them ? __eou__ They must have mixed hackers with crackers . __eou__ What is crackers then ? __eou__ There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers , but they aren't . They break into computers and break the phone system . Real hackers call these people crackers , and want nothing to do with them . __eou__ So they are two totally different concepts . __eou__ Well , the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy , irresponsible and not very bright , and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer . Unfortunately , many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers . This irritates real hackers to no end . __eou__ I see . Then the basic different is , hackers build things , crackers break them . __eou__ You got it . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__
I don't have my homework today . __eou__ You usually are good about turning it in ; what happened ? __eou__ I was really sick . __eou__ But couldn't you have done it when you felt better ? __eou__ Yes , I probably could . __eou__ You have already missed one other assignment ; when can I expect the make-ups ? __eou__ Next class meeting . __eou__ That will be soon enough , but make sure you get next week's assignment in as well , all right ? __eou__ That would work for me . __eou__ Good . I know that you are capable of being an excellent student . __eou__
What are you reading about in that science magazine ? __eou__ There are several interesting articles on recent scientific breakthroughs . I just finished reading one about cloning . __eou__ I ’ m not sure I like the idea of that . I don ’ t want people copying me or other people . It could be very confusing . __eou__ According to the article , you have no real need to worry . Research nowadays is focussing on cloning parts of a human body to replace damaged or lost parts , not on recreating a whole human . __eou__ In the future , that could be possible . __eou__ In this article , scientists say that if you took the genes from someone and tried to create a copy of a person , there ’ s no guarantee that the copy would look or act like the original ! __eou__ Really ? What else have you discovered ? __eou__ I read about how scientists are using material from plants and animals to create new medicines . For example , an animal be immune to disease that affects human . So , scientists find out why it ’ s immune __eou__ That ’ s great , because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves . I prefer natural remedies to man-made ones . __eou__
Thanks for helping me up . __eou__ Are you OK ? I didn't mean to put you in danger . __eou__ I'm the hazardous one here .

Everyone's laughing ! __eou__ He said you obviously prefer Greek comedies to Greek tragedies . __eou__

I waited for a full hour in the cold wind . __eou__ So how long did you stay ? __eou__ I left after the opening dance . I couldn't wait to get out of there . __eou__
What is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space ? __eou__ I wasn't quite prepared for the view of the Earth as we left . It was just awe-inspiring . It emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole Earth , where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance . I wasn't quite prepared for that . It's inevitably etched in my memory . __eou__ When viewing the Earth from space , do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind ? __eou__ Detached . You're literally detached from one planet , captured by another . Your only link to reality is the Earth out there ; fortunate - 1y , it stays in view the whole time . __eou__ There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality . Is it going to be some future project that never happens ? __eou__ I believe it's certainly for real . It without question has suffered a lot of delays . But there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in December . It is a reality . It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground . __eou__ There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission . It seemed to fizzle out . Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner ? __eou__ I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair , that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on . But only time will tell . __eou__ You had gone to the moon twice , orbited space around the Earth lots of times , and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have . How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness ? I just can't wait . __eou__ If I were the man making the decisions , you could get in line tomorrow . I strongly support ordinary people going into space . Unfortunately , I don't think it will be in the near future . __eou__
Where did you go yesterday ? __eou__ I went to play tennis in the public park . __eou__ How often do you play tennis ? __eou__ Twice a week . How about you ? __eou__ I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball . __eou__ But it is very difficult to gather a team of players together . __eou__ I usually play with my schoolmates . __eou__ Do you like watching football matches ? __eou__ Yes , I went to the Than He Sports Center for a football match last Sunday . __eou__ Oh , I watched it on television . It was an exciting match . __eou__
Where is your native place ? __eou__ My native place is Shanghai , which is a very beautiful cosmopolitan city . __eou__ So are you a local ? __eou__ Yes , I am a local resident . __eou__
What ’ re you doing now ? __eou__ I ’ m watching TV . __eou__ You ’ re supposed to clean your teeth before you go to bed . __eou__ I will . __eou__ And don ’ t ever forget it . __eou__

I'd be very willing to help you with that . __eou__ Thanks . I really appreciate it.In fact , I do need a letter of recommendation for this scholarship . __eou__ What kind of scholarship is it ? __eou__ It's an undergraduate scholarship offered by the American Minority Students Scholarship Association . I'm eligible for it because I'm Asian American . __eou__ Fine . I know about that scholarship.You have to be a student in your junior year , and you have to have a grade point average of 3.7 or higher . __eou__ I'm a junior now , and my GPA is 3.92 . __eou__ Excellent . So you'll have a good chance of getting it . __eou__ Well , I hope so . The competition is probably pretty heavy.And they want a writing sample too . __eou__ Do you have an essay you want to send them ? __eou__ No , they want a special essay . I must write an essay on a particular question they pose . __eou__ What is the question ? __eou__ They give applicants a topic.The topic is , The Place of Ethnic Minorities in a Democratic Society.My essay must be three pages typed and double-spaced . __eou__ That's a pretty short essay . __eou__ Yes , but I need to write it by next week . __eou__ Good luck . I'm sure you will do a good job . __eou__ I came here today to talk to you because ... Well , I need to ask two favors . __eou__ Sure . What are they ? __eou__ First , I need a letter of recommendation . __eou__ I'd be happy to write one for you . __eou__ And second ... Well , I'm not sure if it's normal . __eou__ What is it ? Do you want me to read your essay ? __eou__ Yes , if you could . I mean , if you could read it to make sure there are no mistakes.Or maybe you'd have some suggestions . __eou__ Of course I could read it . That's no problem . But you need to get it to me soon . __eou__ I will . I want to write the first draft tonight.So I could bring it tomorrow morning . __eou__ Alright . If you can bring it to me tomorrow morning , I can talk with you after class on Friday.So I'll have some feedback for you before the weekend . __eou__ That would really help me a lot . I'm very grateful . __eou__ Don't mention it . I'm always willing to help good students . __eou__
Did you hear how cold it got last night ? __eou__ I heard the radio announcer say it was 18 degrees below zero . __eou__ It was so cold this morning . I could hardly start my car . __eou__ My car didn't want to start either at first . __eou__ Don't you have a garage ? __eou__ Not in the new apartment . We have to leave the car in the parking lot . __eou__ How much antifreeze did you put in your new car then ? You must have to keep it well below zero . __eou__ I do . Right now I have it protected up to 30 below zero . __eou__ Does it ever get that cold on here ? __eou__ Not really . It sometimes gets to 20 below . __eou__ Speaking of cold , how about going for a cup of coffee to warm up . __eou__
What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? __eou__ I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . __eou__ Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done . __eou__ You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . __eou__
What's the matter with you , Paul ? __eou__ I'm not feeling well . I think I'm having a cold . __eou__ Looks like it.You need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest . __eou__ Yeah , I will . __eou__
You look pale today . __eou__ I didn't wear make-up this morning . __eou__ You should do sports to keep young . __eou__ You're right.Make - up can only disguise my age , but exercise may delay it . __eou__

He ’ s an executive for a large computer company . I saw an interview with him on TV yesterday . They were asking his opinion about future uses for computers . __eou__ Well ! I guess people don ’ t find him so peculiar anymore . __eou__

The worst thing was the guy behind me . He snored all through the night ! __eou__ Really ? But you were in first class ! Nobody woke that guy up ? __eou__ The stewardess said it's not company policy to wake people up for any reason . __eou__ That's terrible ! So you didn't get any sleep ? __eou__ Not much ... but that's ok ... I'm a night owl anyway . __eou__ So , aside from visiting our factory and offices , are there any other things you want to accomplish while you're in China ? __eou__ I'd love to squeeze in a trip to the Great Wall . __eou__ That's not a problem .

Forget it ! __eou__ But you've been looking for that stamp for years . __eou__ It's not worth it . Besides , I have to save up to pay for some bills . __eou__ Bummer .

I feel confused by all the diet options out there . I don ’ t know which one actually works . __eou__ Most of them are not so practical . It will be very bad for your health if you skip lunches or supers as the recommended . I think making an exercise plan can be more effective . __eou__ Maybe you ’ re right . It is very expensive to go to a weight-loss center . I ’ d better join in a fitness club . __eou__ You don ’ t need to lose weight , you are not fat . __eou__ I bought an exercise dress yesterday and I found it was hard to dress it up . __eou__
I visited the Polar Aquarium today . __eou__ Is it like a zoo of polar animals ? __eou__ Almost .

I want to take my kids there some day . too . __eou__

What ’ s the area of your country ? __eou__ It ’ s not very big . It ’ s a little over half a million square kilometers . __eou__ That sounds quite big ! How many people live there ? __eou__ There are about 30 million people in my country . Most of them live in the north . __eou__ What ’ s the average income ? __eou__ That ’ s the really hard to say . I think most people earn about two thousand dollars a month , if you convert the money from our currency into dollars . __eou__ So your country is fairly rich . __eou__ I think we are richer than most countries , but not as rich as countries in western Europe . Our biggest problem at the moment is unemployment , which is roughly 8 % . It has doubled over the last four years . __eou__ Unemployment in my country is a fraction of that . __eou__
Look at this headline - Elvis Baby Born on Spacecraft . Where do these tabloids get such crazy stories ? __eou__ I ’ Ve often wondered the same thing . I also wonder who reads them . Then I realize that I ’ m standing here reading them myself . __eou__ It looks as though everyone in line reads them , or at least looks at the headlines . __eou__ I think we picked the right line . This one seems to be moving more quickly than the others . __eou__ Maybe our checker is faster at scanning the food . __eou__ I ’ m glad . We have only about twenty things here , and I ’ m in a hurry to get home . __eou__
The answer is zero ! What a let-down ! __eou__ I really want to take him over my knee . __eou__ No hard feelings . After all , he is a child . __eou__ If you say so ! __eou__

I didn't realize it . I promise I'll keep it down in the future . __eou__ Oh , it's no problem.It ' s OK.You know , it only happened once . __eou__ I am glad we've straightened everything out . __eou__

I was quite nervous during the interview . I really want to have the job . Right now , I am still a little on the edge . I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview . __eou__ Take it easy . It is all over now . How was it going , anyway ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . I think I did well in the paper exams . I was prepared to answer a lot of questions , but they didn't ask those as I expected . To my surprise , the manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me . __eou__ That's strange . But probably , it is the new interview technique they call it ' Getting to know you more personally ' . What about your answers ? __eou__ Just did my best . __eou__

I don't know why people are just mad about David Peckham . Is there really anything so fascinating with him ? __eou__ He appeals to the fans thanks to two things __eou__ You mean he plays well ? Yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks . __eou__ Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts.However , a few free kicks often make everything different , especially scoring one such goal in the nick of time . __eou__ In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls . __eou__ Yes , his face looks are manly , with a straight nose and infinite eyes . As a man of medium height in the West , he keeps a powerful but elegant figure , looking neither lanky nor stout . __eou__ And he is English !

Office software like Windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier . __eou__ Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place one machine instead of three . __eou__ Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before . __eou__ When will we get one of those ? __eou__ You know our boss always trying to save the last penny . We have to use up the equipment first . __eou__
Congratulations ! Mr . Stuart ! You won the city marathon . __eou__ Thank you . I am very excited . __eou__ We are all very proud of you . __eou__ I am very happy , too .

Are you ok , Chuck ? You look pale . __eou__ I'm fine , Katherine . I just stayed up late last night working on my Chinese . __eou__ Oh , poor you . You know what ? I found a new way to learn Chinese and it works very well . __eou__ You did ? Do tell me . I've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it , but I've made little progress ! __eou__ Sure . I'm learning Chinese through songs . __eou__ So you're learning Chinese songs ? __eou__ You can say that . I can actually sing some of them now . __eou__ That's a real achievement . How did you do that ? __eou__ I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer . __eou__ It makes sense . __eou__ It does . I've learned some Chinese folk songs this way . They are clearly presented and easy to follow . __eou__ Can Join you , Katherine ? I do want to have a try . __eou__ Why not ? I downloaded a beautiful song the other day . We can learn it together now . __eou__ Great . Do you think we need a Chinese dictionary ? __eou__ Yes , just in case we run into me new characters . __eou__ Ok . I will bring it with me . __eou__
Where to , miss ? __eou__ Hi ! Crenshaw and Hawthorne , at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner . __eou__ Sure thing . So , where are you flying in from ? __eou__ From China . __eou__ Really ? You don ’ t look very Chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so . __eou__ It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products . __eou__ Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ? __eou__ Don ’ t you know it ’ s rude to ask a lady her age ? __eou__ Don ’ t get me wrong ! It ’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas ! __eou__ Well thank you ! In that case , I am 26 years old , and what about yourself ? __eou__ I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U . S of A , although I have some Colombian heritage . __eou__ Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ? __eou__ Uh ... yeah .. of course ! __eou__ Que bien ! Sentences poems habeas en espanol ! __eou__
Oh , boy , I hate to say this , but I really have to leave now . __eou__ That ’ s all right . I understand . __eou__ I ’ m so sorry . __eou__ That ’ s ok . Don ’ t be sorry . We ’ ll talk later . __eou__
Have you thought of moving at all , Sarah ? __eou__ We ’ Ve thought about it , but my husband and I can ’ t afford it right now . The only thing we could afford would be living in the slums , which is something I don ’ t want to do . __eou__ Buying a house can be expensive , but there are ways to find cheaper houses . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Well , sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . You ’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . Do you know anyone who has done that before ? __eou__ Sure , my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way . They ’ re pretty satisfied with it . __eou__ Is the house pretty run-down . __eou__ Not at all . The woman , who owned it , took good care of it . But when she died , she had no family left and no will , so the government had to sell it for her . __eou__ Was it a very old house ? __eou__ It was about 75 years old . There were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time . __eou__ Is it in a good location ? __eou__ The area can be a bit rough in the evenings , but the neighbors watch out for each other , so it ’ s ok . __eou__
Do Mona and Jim need a new house ? __eou__ No , they have a big new fancy house . __eou__ Does Jim make a lot of money ? __eou__ Yes , he does . He is a science fiction writer . __eou__ Does Jim need to make more money ? __eou__ Afraid so . The more the better . __eou__ What do they need all that money for ? __eou__ Well , they spend it pretty quick . New clothes , new computers and new cars every year . And they ’ Ve got a cook and housekeeper.Mona used to be an actress , she likes to spend a lot of money . __eou__ Do they have any children ? __eou__ No . They want children but no luck yet . __eou__ What does Jim like to do ? __eou__ Jim likes to travel around the world.That ' s expensive ! So he tries to make a lot of money . __eou__ What does Mona like to do ? __eou__ Oh , she enjoys spending money on fancy parties.Mona loves to wear sexy dresses , and she has quite a bit of jewelry . __eou__ Wow ... She sounds like a high maintenance wife . __eou__ I guess so . She is also interested in politics . She knows everyone in city government . __eou__ Politics can be an expensive hobby . __eou__ She is pretty serious about it . Her uncle is a mayor . She wants to follow in his footsteps . __eou__ Politics is a hard game to play . __eou__ She might do well . Everyone seems to like her . __eou__
Are you alright , child ? __eou__ Hey , I still know my name . __eou__ What did the nurse say ? __eou__ She said I have a fever but nothing major . __eou__ In that case , you should go home and get plenty of rest . __eou__ What if this small fever turns into a big fever ? __eou__ Then I'll phone our family physician and make an appointment for you . __eou__
Who was the best teacher that you ever had ? __eou__ That would have to be Miss Baymler , my fourth grade teacher . __eou__ What was she like ? __eou__ She was patient , kind , fun , smart , caring , and yet strict , too . I really learned a lot from her . __eou__ What kind of things did you learn ? __eou__ She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do . __eou__ Anything ? Do you really believe that we can do anything ? __eou__ If you really want to do something and you work hard at it , I believe you can do it . __eou__ You said she was strict . Did she have a lot of rules ? __eou__ She had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable . For example , the students had to treat each other with respect , or they would be disciplined . __eou__ I see . She sounds like she really cared about her students . __eou__ Yes . She treated us all fairly . She don ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets . __eou__ Really ? Doesn ’ t every teacher have a teacher ’ s pet ? __eou__ Well . To be honest , I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades . However , Miss Baymler didn ’ t treat me any differently . She really didn ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets . __eou__ Do you know what she is doing now ? __eou__ As a matter of fact , I do . After she taught our class , she got married and moved to another city . Then , she started writing children ’ s book . __eou__ Have you ever read one of the books ? __eou__ Of course ! Both children and adults enjoy her books . __eou__ Why don ’ t you recommend one to me ? __eou__ ok ! I ’ ll bring one to you next time . __eou__
Mum , this is for you . __eou__ Oh , flowers ! What for , my dear ? __eou__ Happy Mother's Day to you , Mum ! __eou__ Oh , thank you.You are so sweet ! __eou__
Did you like the party ? __eou__ Not particularly . I was rather disappointed . __eou__ Why ? What had you expected ? __eou__ I ’ d expected it to be much more exciting . __eou__
Look , daddy is on again . Don't you think he is handsome ? __eou__ To some extent , he is . And what do you think we move to a better place ? I can't see him clearly from here . __eou__ The seats in the middle of this stadium are great , but they're already occupied by somebody else . __eou__ Oh , thank you for pointing that out . By the way , have you been following NBA for this season ? __eou__ Of course , tomorrow evening there will be a most exciting game . __eou__ Who plays who ? __eou__ Rockets vs Lakers . Yao Ming , my idol , will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience . __eou__ It's amazing . And when did he begin to play in the NBA ? __eou__ In 2002 . And since then he has attracted more attention than ever . __eou__ I can't consider you as a little kid any more . I know he is very tall . __eou__ Oh , you know something . He is 2.26 meters tall . But he is also nimble and skillful . __eou__ I also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game . __eou__ Yes , what's worse is he can't take any further part in the game . __eou__ That's really terrible . Oh , God , we forgot to cheer for Daddy . __eou__ Never mind . After all he is not so attractive as Yao Ming , right ? __eou__ You are always so naughty . __eou__
Pretty ! Say beautiful rather . Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than she altogether-face and figure ? __eou__ I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers . __eou__ Such an eye ! The true hazel eye-and so brilliant ! Regular features , open countenance , with a complexion , Oh ! What a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ' the picture of health ' ; now , she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health . She is loveliness itself . __eou__
Is that Mr . Green ? __eou__ This is him speaking . __eou__ I am calling to inform you that we're happy to have you with us . Welcome aboard , I'm sure your friend would have given you a lot of information of our school and its motto , ways of teaching , etc . __eou__ Yes . I am very glad to have the chance . __eou__
I'm so nervous about this oral test . __eou__ Just calm down . I'm sure you'll do well . __eou__ I just want to get it over with . __eou__
I hear you ’ re taking a music class . I didn ’ t know you ’ re interested in it . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m not . I ’ Ve never had a music class before . __eou__ In my opinion , you ’ ll make it . __eou__ You ’ re having me on again . __eou__ No , I ’ m serious . __eou__
What ’ s the date today ? __eou__ December the fifteenth . The day after tomorrow is little Tom ’ s birthday . __eou__ Right . What present should we give him this time ? By the way , how old is he ? __eou__ Thirteen today and tomorrow . Fourteen the day after tomorrow . __eou__ How time flies ! He ’ s a big boy now . __eou__ And don ’ t forget Mary , Tom ’ s twin sister . It ’ s her birthday , too . __eou__ OK . Let ’ s invite all their little friends to come and celebrate . __eou__
Peter and Mary broke up . __eou__ Are you serious ? __eou__
I had a wonderful evening . __eou__ I did , too.Come and visit us again , will you ? __eou__ I will . __eou__
Do you know Sally ? __eou__ Sally ? She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains . __eou__ Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop a clock . __eou__ Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career . __eou__
Do you hear what happened to Sally ? __eou__ No , what ? __eou__ She had to go to the hospital . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ She passed out in class . Seems she hadn't eaten anything in days . __eou__ Why on earth would she do that ? You mean that she intentionally did not eat any food for days ? That's crazy ! __eou__ Yeah , but that's what she did . __eou__ I can't believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies . And all for a certain look . __eou__ Well , it's not just the girl ’ s fault . It's also society's fault - magazines and ads that show - thin models all saying , It's in to be thin . It's hard for them not to listen . __eou__ True , but there are limits . Being thin is one thing ; starving oneself to death is another . No one forces them to do this . __eou__
Have you ever thought about Tom ’ s attitude ? __eou__ I ’ Ve cut it up and come to the conclusion that hi is actually sick of Jenny ’ s brother . But he likes Jenny . She is a big apple in his eye . __eou__ Love me , love my dog . He ’ s a sensible kind man . __eou__ That ’ s why many people look up to him . __eou__
Have you found another job yet , Sally ? __eou__ No , I haven't , but I've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper . __eou__ What kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__ Either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel . __eou__ You haven't had any experience in either of those fields . __eou__ I know.But I'd like to try.Look , here are some advertisements that I've cut out . __eou__
Hi . Are you new in this class ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I really don't know anyone . __eou__ My name is Steven . What's your name ? __eou__ My name is Bill . How are your lessons going ? __eou__ Very well . And my favorite subject is Chinese . __eou__ I prefer to learn English . In my opinion , English is easier than Chinese . __eou__ I guess English has fewer characters . __eou__ You are right . __eou__
Robert , this is my friend , Mrs . Smith . __eou__ Hi , Nice to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you too . __eou__ Mrs . Smith , what do you do for work ? __eou__ I'm a doctor . __eou__ Oh . Where do you work ? __eou__ New York University hospital in New York City . What do you do ? __eou__ I'm a teacher . __eou__ What do you teach ? __eou__ I teach English . __eou__ Where ? __eou__ At a high school in New Jersey . __eou__ That's nice . How old are you ? __eou__ I'm 32 . __eou__
Hah ! For three hours while you threw up . And Femi dumped me for that . I really loved her . __eou__ I'm so sorry , Taylor . Go talk to her . I'm sure she'd be happy to see you . __eou__ She probably wouldn't even recognize me . She's probably married . __eou__ Yi-jun said Femi was talking about you . So get out there , Tiger ! __eou__ Was she really ? So you're telling me there's a chance ? __eou__ Can't hurt to try . Carpe diem . Who can say if we'll be here tomorrow or not ? __eou__
Oh , Ralph , I heard it is very dangerous traveling in space . Disasters have happened before . If the spaceship were out of order . . . __eou__ You should be optimistic about this . Things have taken a good turn . You should remember that less than two centuries ago the dangers of train travel seemed similarly terrible . __eou__ But is it possible that travelers could be hit by meteors ? __eou__ It's once in blue moon . __eou__ What do you think is the real danger man faced in space ? __eou__ The main one is radiation . There are two sorts of radiation man must fear in space . The first is radiation from the sun , and this is particularly dangerous when the sun is very active and explosions are occurring on its surface . The second , less harmful , comes from the so-called Van Allen Belts . __eou__
Hi , Mark , did you catch the game last night ? __eou__ No , I was out . Was it worth watching ? __eou__ You didn ’ t hear ? Spain won , two to zero . __eou__ Oh , really ? So , Spain is through to the next round ? __eou__ Yeah . The final is next week . You have to watch it . __eou__
Get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work . What a life ! I've had enough of it . __eou__ Cool down , man . Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic . But life isn't really all that . You should take the initiative and make some changes first . __eou__ What should I do then ? __eou__ I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . It may offer you many benefits . First , it's good for your health . I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate . While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . You might as well sleep out for a longer hour . __eou__ I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . After all , it's a sport . But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ? __eou__ Well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing . I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great ! __eou__
How many people are there in your family ? __eou__ Five . Besides my parents and me , there are my brother and sister . __eou__ That ’ s a big family . How old is your brother ? __eou__ Eighteen . __eou__ What about your sister ? __eou__ She ’ s not quite twenty-five . __eou__ Do you miss your family ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Do you often go home ? __eou__ No . But I often send e-mail to them . And make a call to my parents regularly . __eou__ How often do you call to them ? __eou__ Once a week . __eou__
I'm terribly nervous . __eou__ Calm down ! __eou__
What's wrong ? You don't like ancient Egypt ? __eou__ Actually , I don't like history . Lately , these shows are always about the Pyramids . __eou__ The Pyramids are amazing ! Millions of gigantic stones ... each one perfect ... __eou__ And nobody knows who built them , right ? It's a total mystery ! __eou__ You sound like the TV ! You're not going to tell me that aliens built the Pyramids , are you ? __eou__
What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps . __eou__ I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated . __eou__ Come on , nothing can be that bad . __eou__ But promise me , you'll keep it a secret . __eou__ Ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ? __eou__ I've fallen in love with my boss . __eou__ Really ? Is he married ? __eou__ Bo , of course not . He is still single . __eou__ Then what's your problem ? __eou__ I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us . __eou__ Oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip . __eou__ Worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days . __eou__ Office romance is very tricky . __eou__ It gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed . __eou__ Cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine . __eou__
How may I help you ? __eou__ I want to return this video . __eou__ Is that all you need ? __eou__ I also need to check these books out . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ That ’ s everything . __eou__ I need your library card . __eou__ I have it . Here you go . __eou__ Do you need anything else ? __eou__ That ’ s everything . __eou__ Your books are due back two weeks from today . __eou__ Thank you . Good night . __eou__
Did you happen to bring that book that we were talking about yesterday ? __eou__ I did . Let me go get it for you . Here you go . __eou__ Thanks so much . __eou__ I like the way that the gifts I get increasingly more lavish . __eou__ I had no idea that there were specific things that should be given on different anniversaries . __eou__ So what does it say you should give your wife this first anniversary ? __eou__ It says that traditionally , give something made of paper . __eou__ I can think of two things made of paper — stationery and money . __eou__
I'm going to the park to play baseball with the guys . __eou__ But you promised to play chess with me this afternoon . __eou__ Yeah , but that was before the guys ask me to join the team . __eou__ So what ? __eou__ You know how much I want to be on the team , and now there is an opening for me.If I don't go to practise today.They ' ll get someone else and I'll miss my chance . __eou__ I don't care about baseball.You know I need to practice for the chess championship and you promised to help with me if I washed the dishes for you last Sunday , and I did . __eou__ I know , and I will . __eou__ When ? __eou__ After baseball practice . __eou__ And then , it'll be dinner time , then homework , and then your Show is on.You are going to break your promise . __eou__ No , I won't . I'm going to skip TV tonight and work on your chess game with you if that's ok with you . __eou__ Well , I'd rather do it the way we set up.But if you promise to give me your best game , it's ok with me . __eou__ No problem , I'll play as hard as I can and give you an extra game to say thanks . __eou__
What stresses you out the most ? __eou__ Probably my parents . __eou__ How so ? __eou__ Well , during school , they wanted good grades . Then after I got a job , they wanted me to get a better job . And finally , they want me to get married . __eou__ You have to deal with a lot of pressure from your parents . __eou__ Your parents are not like that ? __eou__ Ever since I brought home some bad grades in elementary school , they never expected much . __eou__ You're lucky . __eou__ What do you do to deal with the stress ? __eou__ Not much I can do . It's always there . I sometimes go out with some friends and drink , but that's only a temporary solution . The stress always returns in the morning . __eou__ That sucks . You wanna go grab a beer ? __eou__ Sure . Sounds great . Let's go . __eou__
Tony looks very handsome in the suit . __eou__ He prefers suits to jackets . __eou__ Judge from his look , he's a very serious person . __eou__ As a matter of fact , he is . __eou__
Lily thinks that the job takes a back seat to the family after she is married . __eou__ She must be a good wife . __eou__ Not necessarily . This is only what she says , not what she does . __eou__ I see . __eou__
What's the weather like ? __eou__ I don't know . I just woke up . __eou__ Why don't you look outside ? __eou__ Okay . It looks like rain . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ The sky is gray . __eou__ Is it raining right now ? __eou__ No . __eou__ How do you know ? __eou__ The street isn't wet . __eou__ I have to go shopping today . __eou__ You'd better take an umbrella . __eou__
Hey there , you look a little lost . Are you new here ? __eou__ Yeah how ’ d you know ? __eou__ You can always spot the newbies . I can give you a few pointers if you want . Were you trying to use this machine here ? __eou__ Yeah ! I just started my training today and I ’ m not really sure where to begin . __eou__ It ’ s ok , I know how it is . This machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ? __eou__ Well , I don ’ t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio . __eou__ In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle . __eou__ Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ’ s a lot of weight ! __eou__ It ’ s not that much . Just watch ... I ’ m ok ... __eou__
I don't know how John can put up with his son , who fools around without working . __eou__ He's out of John's hands . Nothing he can do about such a black sheep . __eou__ If I were him , I would give him a good talking-to . I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that . __eou__
Do you like ice skating ? __eou__ I have never tried it . __eou__ Then you've got to try it . Let's go to the skating rink on Thursday . __eou__ Sorry , I don't think I can . __eou__ Friday then . How about it ? __eou__ Friday is great . __eou__ It's settled then . __eou__
Gordon , you're ever so late . __eou__ Yes , I am sorry . I missed the bus . __eou__ But there's a bus every ten minutes , and you are over 1 hour late . __eou__ Well , I missed several buses . __eou__ How on earth can you miss several buses ? __eou__ I , ah ... , I got have late . __eou__ Oh , come on , Gordon , it's the afternoon now . Why were you late really ? __eou__ Well , I ... I lost my wallet , and I ... __eou__ Have you got it now ? __eou__ Yes , I found it again . __eou__ When ? __eou__ This morning . I mean ... __eou__ I am not convinced by your explanation . __eou__
Let's have seafood tonight and then go see the new movie at Mall Cinema.Betsy told me it's a beautiful love story and I shouldn't miss it . __eou__ Oh , Goodness , please not again.That ' s what we did last week . __eou__ No , we didn't . Last week we went to see that movie about a man's struggle against mental illness . __eou__ Right , it was a chick flick , just like this one , so what's the difference ? Besides , this is the last week for the third movie in Destroyer series and I want to see that on a big screen . Action movies need to be seen in a theater on a big screen . __eou__ Oh , yeah , and I did promise to see it with you if we went to that movie last week.But you liked that movie , didn't you ? __eou__ Oh , sure , it was great . I had popcorn for dinner and paid the price of a movie ticket to get a two-hour nap . __eou__ It wasn't that bad , and you're the one that insisted on skipping dinner.We went to an excellent restaurant . __eou__ That place doesn't have a single meat dish.Just fish and shellfish and you know I don't like fish that much . __eou__ And I don't like meat that much.The only meat I eat is chicken . __eou__ But when I pick the restaurant , we go to a place that has both chicken and fish . I always respect your food preferences . __eou__ Well , I suppose that , to be fair , you should get to pick the movie and we can go to a restaurant that serves meat . __eou__ Now you're talking , we can see that love story next time . __eou__
How's your new job going ? __eou__ Really well , thanks . __eou__ How are you finding your new boss ? __eou__ She's not bad . She's a bit bossy , but I'm sure I'll get used to her . __eou__ Would you rather have her or your old boss back ? __eou__ She's far better than my old boss . He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down . __eou__ How about your new co-workers ? __eou__ They are all pretty easy-going . It's a very friendly place to work . __eou__ Do you miss your old co-workers ? __eou__ Of course . I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well . They were like family to me . __eou__ Do people in different departments get along with each other ? __eou__ Sure . Since we work together in teams , we have to get along with each other . __eou__ Do you like working in teams with people from different departments ? __eou__ Yes , it helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives . __eou__ Do you like working in teams ? __eou__ I prefer it to working independently . I think most people do . __eou__
Linda , John and I are going to get married next week . __eou__ That's wonderful . Congratulations . __eou__ Thank you , Linda . We would love you to come to our wedding . __eou__ I'd love to .

I like the striped pattern . __eou__ yes , I adore simple fashions . How does it look on me ? __eou__ it looks great , but you need something to go with it . It's too plain on its own . __eou__ how about this blue sweater ? __eou__ that's a good idea . When did you buy it ? Is it a name brand ? __eou__ yes , but I bought it when it was on sale , 50 % off the original price . OK , what do you think ? __eou__ that looks lovely . Just one more thing---you need a pair of earrings . __eou__ I've got a pair of pearl earrings . Here it is . __eou__ perfect ! __eou__ you have good fashion sense , Karen . __eou__ thanks . We should be ourselves . There are so many fashion victims out there . __eou__ yes , but with our sense we'll always look good . __eou__
Susan ? What brings you here today ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve got some papers due . __eou__ Really ? So what ’ s the news ? __eou__ Not too good yet . Better than I was though . __eou__

What do you think are the main causes of war today ? __eou__ I ’ d say the main reason is poverty . Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . __eou__ It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . __eou__ Several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . __eou__ How do you think they could be ended ? __eou__ I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that . __eou__ So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them . __eou__ It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries . __eou__ Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . __eou__ The problem is that many poor people might suffer . __eou__
Are you feeling better today , Bill ? __eou__ Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening . __eou__ You'd better give up smoking .

I need something to keep me awake . __eou__ Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work . __eou__ Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it . __eou__
Well , I must be off now . I have an appointment at six . __eou__ In that case , I won't keep you any longer . Drop in any time . __eou__ Ok . Goodbye . __eou__ See you later . __eou__

I think you've helped make a big difference in her life . __eou__ Do you have any plans for next Sunday evening ? __eou__ No , why ? __eou__ My friend , who had the mishap , wants to take us to dinner to show her gratitude for helping her . __eou__ She doesn't need to do that , I didn't do anything . __eou__ She feels you gave me the freedom to be able to assist her and she appreciates that . Come on , Let's indulge her . __eou__
Hey , Tom , what to go for a run ? __eou__ No thanks . I like to run in the morning .

He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know . __eou__ Yeah but , he is always in a really foul mood . I try to find out what ’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but , he always shuts down and brushes me off . __eou__ Men are like that you know.They can feel nervous , anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness . __eou__ I guess you are right . What do you think I should do ? He wasn ’ t always this grouchy you know ... __eou__ Talk to him , try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn ’ t work , I say get rid of him and get a new one ! __eou__ You are something else you know that ? __eou__

It is somehow embarrassing for them to see each other everyday . __eou__ That is the down side of an office romance . I hope their work is not affected by the emotional stress . The boss must be very annoyed if that will be the case . __eou__ Well , Tina says she would be able to handle it and concentrate on her own work , easier set them done . But working harder and concentrating only on the job might well helped to overcome the initial stress of the breakup . __eou__
Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday . __eou__ Oh where was that ? __eou__ I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track . __eou__ Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . She is always making us kids eat the proper foods . __eou__ Well , it pays off for her . How old is she anyway ? __eou__ She will be 86 next month . __eou__ That is truly amazing ! __eou__
What time shall I pick you up ? __eou__ How about 6:30 ? __eou__ That'll be fine . See you soon . __eou__

Has the train come yet ? __eou__ No , I ‘ Ve been waiting for ages . __eou__ It ’ s so unreliable . I ’ Ve been late for my meetings all this week . __eou__ Yes , me too . I think I ’ Ve lost some important clients recently because of this train ! __eou__ Yes , my customers have started to complain too ! __eou__ Oh look ! Here it comes now ! __eou__
I've got some bad news about the bike you lent me . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ I fell on the way to school , and your bike got scratched . I'm really sorry . __eou__ Don't worry about it . It's not new , it already has a few scratches . Did you get hurt ? __eou__ No , thank you . __eou__ That's the most important thing . __eou__ It's kind of you to say . I feel a little stupid . __eou__ Forget about it . __eou__ When you lent me the bike , it looked brand new , almost anyway . __eou__ Maybe , but really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well . __eou__ I appreciate that , thank you . __eou__
Jenny is going to marry another man next month . __eou__ Yes , I know . __eou__ But , how can you be so calm . You loved her so much . __eou__ At least I ’ m the one who rates with her . I ’ m glad we can still be friends . __eou__
What's your favorite sport ? __eou__ Basketball , I'm a basketball fan . __eou__
Hello , Jane . What do you do in your spare time ? __eou__ Well , nothing special , reading , watching TV , walking , and so on . __eou__ Don't you have any hobbies , like stamp collecting or things like that ? __eou__ No , I don't have any hobbies . How about you ? __eou__ I like collecting antiques . It's expensive , but it's a lot of fun . __eou__ Really ? How many collections do you have ? __eou__ So far I have more than 500 collections . __eou__ Among those collections , which is the most expensive ? __eou__ A set of ancient china . It is really invaluable . __eou__
It seems to me that everything is going digital nowadays . __eou__ Yes . Speaking of digital wares , I bought a digital camera last week . __eou__ Cool ! What brand __eou__ A Sony . It's only one third the size of my old camera and looks rather smart . __eou__ What about the quality ? __eou__ Superb ! It's a 4 megapixel one and the photos it takes are very vivid and clear . __eou__
It's four o'clock already . I hate to leave , but I think I must . __eou__ Can you stay a little longer ? __eou__ I'm sorry , but I can't . __eou__
Can I see your parents some time tomorrow ? __eou__ Sorry , they are too busy these days . __eou__ How about this weekend ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . __eou__
Happy Thanksgiving ! __eou__ You , too . __eou__ Let's have pumpkin pie . __eou__ It's my favorite . __eou__
Are you going anywhere for your vacation ? __eou__ Yes , we're making plans for a tour . __eou__ That'll be lovely . Where are you going ? __eou__ Well start out from Long Island this Friday . We've planned a four day drive to Salt Lake City , where we'll join my brother and his family on his fortieth birthday . __eou__ Well , you've got to prepare a lot of food and enough sleeping bags then . __eou__ Oh , we'll spend the nights in hotels and enjoy local food as we pass by . How does it sound , David ? __eou__ It sounds good . You can do a lot of sightseeing , too . __eou__ Yes , we'll take our time . And we'll go to Five-lake Strict and the Wall Street . __eou__ So , you're going to have a really nice vacation . __eou__ You can say that again . __eou__

We'd like to have some good dishes of local specialties . __eou__ OK . __eou__ How many courses are there altogether , please ? __eou__ Eight . __eou__ Could you tell me some of entrees about the dinner ? __eou__ Sure . The main courses are roast Beijing duck and fried eel slices . __eou__ Very good . __eou__
Did you watch TV last night , Rose ? __eou__ Yeah . I saw a science program . It was quite interesting . __eou__ What was it about ? __eou__ Mars . Scientists say there might be water on it . __eou__ If so , we may live there someday . __eou__ I hope so . Did you know the US successfully sent two robotic explorers to Mars last month ? __eou__ Sure . I heard about this on the TV . On January 3rd , 2004 , Explorer Spirit landed near the so-called Guser Crater . And three weeks later , Spirit's twin explorer , Opportunity , landed on Meridian Planum named by scientists . __eou__ Yes . Both have sent back pictures of the planet . And the latter did a better job . __eou__
How is your job search going , Janet ? __eou__ I found the ideal position . I ’ m working for a plumbing company . __eou__ Are you serious ? You studied mathematics at college for four years , and now you have a job working with your hands ! __eou__ Plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge , and creativity . I love this job . __eou__ I can see that . But I didn ’ t know you had experience in that line of work . __eou__ I didn ’ t , but I applied for an apprenticeship , and since I studied math , AND I have a good attitude , my application was accepted . __eou__ Congratulations ! You do have the right attitude . __eou__
We are going to the concert this evening . Will you join us ? __eou__ I'm very sorry I can't . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I've been snowed under with work since my boss was away on business . __eou__
Well , if it isn't the teacher's pet ! __eou__ Stop it . Teacher doesn't treat me any different than she does everyone else . __eou__ You can't prove that by me . I saw the score on your report . __eou__ Hey , I worked hard on that report and I deserve the grade I got . __eou__ It just happened to be the highest grade in the class . __eou__ You're just jealous because you didn't do as well as you thought you did . Admit it . __eou__ I worked hard too . But she always gives me a lower grade . __eou__ If you think that she is not fair with your work then you should talk to her in person instead of stewing over it . __eou__
You won one million yuan in a lottery . What will you say ? __eou__ I don't know . I'm too excited to say a word . __eou__ I understand . It's too good to be true , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , too good to be true . __eou__
I was supposed to meet with you at half past one . __eou__ Yes , I see . What did you need to see me about ? __eou__ There's a problem with my schedule . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ Two of my classes occur at the same time . __eou__ Well , I can see that's a problem . __eou__ Is it at all possible for you to fix that error ? __eou__ Yes , I can . Would you still like to have both of these classes ? __eou__ I want to keep both of them , if that's possible . __eou__ Well , let me find you one of these classes on a different day . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__
I went bungee jumping yesterday . __eou__ That sounds like fun . __eou__
Hello , Tom , are you free next Sunday ? __eou__ I think so . Why did you ask that ? __eou__ I'm going to have my first baby , so I plan to hold a baby shower next Sunday . __eou__ Congratulations ! Why do people hold parties before the baby is born ? __eou__ It's the tradition . But baby showers as we know them today were not common until after World Warri . __eou__ In any case , I like baby showers , because they allow friends and family to share the joy and excitement of welcoming a new life into the world . __eou__ So you will come , won't you ? __eou__ Of course . I will prepare a good gift for the new arrival . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
What are you doing ? __eou__ What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ’ t you know what day it is ? __eou__ Mumm . no . __eou__ It ’ s only the day when the world ’ s biggest sporting event is kicking off . __eou__ What ? __eou__ The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country , and all . __eou__ I have no idea what you ’ re talking about . The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl . __eou__ This is bigger than the Super Bowl , man ! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . They first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each group having 4 teams . The top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarter final sand semifinals . __eou__ Sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me . __eou__ Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will become the next champion . So far Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt ; they ’ re really good ! __eou__ All I know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me ! __eou__ Whatever dude , I ’ m going to go watch the opening match . __eou__
We have absolute proof that you committed the crime . __eou__ That's absolutely ridiculous ! __eou__
Where can I get the information , Kate ? __eou__ Ask John . He is sure to know about it . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ He has a finger in the pie . __eou__
That was a tough question . How did you get it right ? __eou__ I just took a shot in the dark . __eou__
There ’ s a letter here for you . __eou__ Let me see it . __eou__ What ’ s the letter about ? __eou__ It ’ s a letter from NYU . __eou__ Tell me what it says ! __eou__ I didn ’ t get in . __eou__ You ’ re lying . __eou__ I ’ m not lying . __eou__ Are you upset ? __eou__ I had high hopes for NYU . __eou__ I ’ m sorry you didn ’ t get accepted . __eou__ Hopefully , I ’ ll get accepted to UCLA . __eou__
The final examination will be held at the end of this month . Have you made good preparation ? __eou__ Sure . I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year . __eou__ Are you sure you can do well this year ? __eou__ I am 100 % certain . __eou__ According to what you did last time , I have my doubts . __eou__ I am sure I can get a 95 this time . __eou__
What ? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I forget all about it . __eou__ How could you ? I reminded you just this morning . __eou__ It's leap my mind . I really feel terrible about it . __eou__ I have been looking forward to this performance all month . __eou__ I'm really sorry I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow . __eou__
Did you hear what happened to Mike last night ? __eou__ No , what ? __eou__ Well , apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . Typical , isn't it ? __eou__ Oh , no . What kind of trouble ? __eou__ Well , I don't know the details , but ... __eou__
Did you hear ? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business ! __eou__ Are you serious ? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! It disgusts me . __eou__ What are you talking about ? How does it exploit people ? __eou__ Well , to begin with , Gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . People have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . Secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . Women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies . __eou__ Geez ! Now that I think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! Although , I have been to Las Vegas , and I didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that . __eou__ You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . Now excuse me , I have a protest rally to organize ! __eou__
I'm tired of you always wearing my clothing ! __eou__ Aren't you the pot calling the kettle black ? You're wearing my pants right now ! __eou__
I ’ m sure it will be wet when we arrive . __eou__ Yes . I dare say it will be . __eou__ It will be Sunday so I expected everything will be closed . __eou__ No . I don ’ t think that ’ s possible . Some places are sure to be open . __eou__ But the bank should be closed so we shouldn't to be able to get any money . __eou__ Mmm , you may be right . __eou__ Do you think we ’ ll need our overcoats ? __eou__ No . We couldn ’ t possibly . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ It will be summer . So it will be hot . __eou__ Is that very likely in England ? __eou__ Yes . It could happen . __eou__
Let's do something really nice for our family this Christmas . __eou__ What did you have in mind ? __eou__ I don't know yet . __eou__ I just know I want to get out of the mindless gift trap . __eou__ I know what you mean . __eou__ I want to give a gift that is really meaningful . __eou__ Or do something that shows we have spent time thinking about them . __eou__ Or what only we are able to give them . __eou__
Uh ... that's Greek to me . __eou__ That means they have tapered legs . __eou__ Well , mine are baggy . They're the kind of pants you can lounge around in . __eou__ Mine are , too . __eou__ So maybe we shouldn't go out after all . __eou__ Yeah . Let's just lounge around ! __eou__
Thanks . Sometimes talking with a friend is a great way to get over something . Do you mind if I vent a little bit ? __eou__ Of course not . If you're feeling bad and want to let your emotions out , you can just say whatever you want to me . __eou__ Great , because I am really mad at William . I mean , what kind of an idiot wouldn't be able to appreciate a smart , beautiful woman like me ? Anybody who would be friends with that guy has to be really dumb . __eou__ Uh , A ... you know I'm friends with William . __eou__ Oh right ... present company excluded , of course ! __eou__
Mary is really a diligent girl . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ She learns to speak Latin by osmosis within three months . __eou__ She is really something . __eou__
Hello , this is David . __eou__ Hi David , this is Marge . Can you meet me after work for a few minutes ? __eou__ Sure ! How about the coffee shop right across the street from my office ? __eou__ That will work . __eou__ Does five thirty work for you ? __eou__ That will be fine . What I have to show you will only take a few minutes of your time . __eou__ Is it the plans for my new house ? __eou__ Yes . I just need to double check a few details with you . __eou__
I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day . __eou__ Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink . __eou__ How about the new bar across road ? __eou__ Sounds good . The food there is fantastic too . __eou__ I agree , I had lunch there last week . __eou__ Excellent ! That sounds like a plan . __eou__
I have an idea for Christmas this year . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Let's not exchange any gifts at all . __eou__ You big scrooge ! __eou__ Hear me out . We can pool the money and give it to a family who could really use it ! __eou__ But you may have some trouble convincing the kids . __eou__ Actual 1y , it was their idea first . __eou__ Now we know that they realize the real meaning of Christmas . __eou__
Do you know anything about Dr . Miller's classes ? __eou__ Yes . Are you in his class ? __eou__ I'm thinking of taking his class next semester . __eou__ He really knew his stuff , but he graded hard . Would that be OK ? __eou__ Yes , I really need someone who is really good . __eou__ I didn't find it overwhelming to earn a good grade if you work at it . Can you do that ? __eou__ Maybe , but I'm not sure . __eou__ Man , this guy was so funny when he was teaching . I like that , don't you ? __eou__ No , that stuff isn't important to me . __eou__ Did you know that he is a fairly new teacher and very current in his field ? __eou__ I don't care about any of that . __eou__ We all are looking for different things in an instructor . I hope I've helped you . __eou__
Hey , Ben ... did you catch the game last night ? __eou__ Uh ... what game ? __eou__ Baltimore defeated Texas by 17 points ! __eou__ Um ... and what sport are we talking about here ? __eou__ Football of course ! __eou__ Oh ... football . Football is cool . I usually try to catch the World Cup finals . __eou__ No , I'm talking about American football . The World Cup is soccer . __eou__ Oh , I understand . I can't say I'm a big fan . I'm from China , and football doesn't have a really big following over there . __eou__ So Chinese people prefer soccer or basketball ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . But to be perfectly honest , I'm not really a sports nut.When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team . Are you a diehard football fan ? __eou__ Oh , certainly . I wouldn't miss a game for the world . My girlfriend says I have an addiction . And actually , if I had to choose between her and my games ... I'd probably pick football . __eou__ It seems Americans are very passionate about sports . Is this just a part of your culture ? __eou__ Oh , yeah ! I think the love of sports starts when kids are very young . Americans come from many different backgrounds so I guess sports are something we can all enjoy together . __eou__
Julia , what's the weather forecast for tomorrow ? __eou__ It says a storm may come tomorrow . __eou__ Oh ! I hate rainy days ! __eou__ Me , too . I'm always in low spirits when it rains . Are you going out tomorrow ? __eou__ Yes . I have to drive to Washington D . C . __eou__ What bad luck ! __eou__ Yeah ! But you know sometimes the weather forecast is not correct . Maybe tomorrow is a clear day . Who knows ? __eou__ Yeah , maybe you are right ! __eou__
Where would you like to have your dinner ? __eou__ I don't care as long as it's a Chinese restaurant . __eou__ You don't like Western food ? __eou__ I really find Chinese dishes more to my taste . __eou__
Thanks for offering to give me a lift . I'm looking forward to this party , but I didn't want to go alone . __eou__ Don't mention it . It's my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ? __eou__ No , this is my first . Last week I went to a cookout 5 for new professors at Dean Barksdale's home . I took a taxi because I didn't want to be late . But I was the first one there . __eou__ I'll bet you were a little embarrassed . __eou__ You're right . The invitation said two to seven . I was there at two o'clock , but most people didn't arrive until three or four . They didn't start cooking until five o ’ clock . __eou__ Cookouts often start slowly . A two o'clock start means you arrive any time after two . __eou__ Thanks for telling me this . __eou__ I was late getting back from the mall , but I'm hurrying . __eou__ Why are you in such a hurry ? They said , Dinner at eight , and it's only seven-fifteen . I don't want to be the first one there again . __eou__ Don't worry . We won't be the first . __eou__
That ’ s really a let-down . __eou__ Yeah . He really does let me down . __eou__ But that should not be the reason for you to lose heart . __eou__ I ’ m at the end of tether . I run out of ideas . __eou__
Some people are always closing their handsets , so it's difficult to inform them . __eou__ Why not send them short messages ? __eou__ Can short messages reach them ? __eou__ Short messages will be kept in the short messages center . Once they open the handsets they will receive them , which is better than you can't find them . __eou__ Why haven't I thought of this skill ? __eou__ I use short messages quite a lot . If it's not too complicated I will send a short message , which can save much phone charge . __eou__ I am informed that many people used short messages to pay a New Year call , and only on the Spring Festival it amounted to 1 billion this year , didn't it ? __eou__ I almost can't live without messages , from which I learn about weather forecasts and stock quotations . __eou__
Hey , sorry to be late . __eou__ What happened to you last night ? You didn ’ t show up . __eou__ My mother was ill . I had to look after her . __eou__ I ’ m so sorry to hear that . __eou__
Hi ! How are you going ? __eou__ Fine , thank you . How are you doing this morning ? __eou__ Not bad . How about you ? Haven't seen you for a long time . __eou__ Yes . I've been to New York . I got back only yesterday . __eou__ Did you enjoy yourself ? __eou__ Very much . New York is such a nice place . Shall I show you some photographs ? __eou__ Thanks , I like looking at photographs . How nice ! Oh , I'm afraid I must be going now . I've got an appointment . Have a good day . __eou__ You too . I hope to see you soon . Goodbye . __eou__ Goodbye . __eou__
My goodness ! What happened ? You have blood on your face . __eou__ Oh , don't worry . I just killed a pigeon . __eou__ How could you have the heart to kill it ? We only have one ! __eou__ It spoiled my painting ! __eou__
How annoying ! __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ Every time I try to start this program , the computer freezes . __eou__ Maybe there's something wrong with the program . __eou__
I heard that James was fired because he got a keep back of 20 thousands dollars from a vender . __eou__ That ’ s open secret . __eou__ But mine could be a lie for his job . __eou__ How did you know that ? __eou__ A little bird whispered to me . Keep that to yourself . __eou__
Who did the stupid thing ? __eou__ It must be Kate . __eou__ No , I don't think you're right.Kate never does things like that.It must be a naughty boy who did it . __eou__
Hello ? __eou__ Hi Tina , It's Joe . __eou__ Hi Joe . __eou__ How's the weather there today ? __eou__ It's really cold . It snowed all day and the schools closed early . __eou__ What's the temperature ? __eou__ It's 30 degrees now . It was even colder this morning . __eou__ Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow ? __eou__ I was watching the news a little earlier . They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow . __eou__ I really don't like the winter . I wish it were summer . __eou__ Me too . How's the weather where you are ? __eou__ It's not too bad , but it's pretty cold here too . It was about 45 today and it rained this afternoon . I heard it's going to be a little warmer tomorrow . __eou__
Mike promised to help us . __eou__ Mike ? How can you trust him to help us ? __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ He is too unpredictable . He says anything that pops into his head . And then he forgets it all . __eou__
Hello , Ann ! Is that you ? __eou__ Yes , it is . Hi , Tom ! It's a real surprise to see you here . __eou__ It's been a long time ! What's new ? __eou__ Nothing much . What about you ? Is everything going well ? __eou__ Not bad I guess . I just got back from Hawaii . __eou__ How was it ? __eou__ I had a good time . You seem to be in a hurry . Don't let me hold you up . __eou__ Sorry , I've got a meeting in half an hour . __eou__ Ok , I won't keep you then . __eou__ Great ! It's good to see you . Goodbye ! __eou__ Yes , stay in touch . Bye ! __eou__ Give me your email , would you ? __eou__ Sure ! It's txyb@gmail.com . __eou__
Tom , I've got good news for you . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Haven't you heard that your novel has won The Nobel Prize ? __eou__ Really ? I can't believe it . It's like a dream come true . I never expected that I would win The Nobel Prize ! __eou__ You did a good job . I'm extremely proud of you . __eou__ Thanks for the compliment . __eou__ You certainly deserve it . Let's celebrate ! __eou__
Tom ! How are you ? We missed you at the party last night . Are you OK ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . I didn ’ t really feel like going out . I guess I ’ m feeling a little homesick . __eou__ Come on . We ’ Ve been through this already ! Look , I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it . __eou__ I was . It ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ’ t be able to home because I can ’ t afford the airfare . I ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family . __eou__ Yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . When I first got here , I ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . I almost let it get to me , but then I started going out , keeping myself busy and before I knew it , I was used to to it . __eou__ I see what you mean , but I ’ m still bummed out . __eou__ OK . how does this sound , let ’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there ! __eou__ You know , I could really go for that . You don ’ t mind being my wingman for tonight ? __eou__ Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys ’ night out ... well kinda ... __eou__ Great ! I must warn you though , whatever happens , don ’ t let me go on a drinking binge . Trust me , it ’ s not a pretty picture ! __eou__
There was something wrong with the plane last Thursday . __eou__ Which flight ? __eou__ Flight 198 . Fortunately , there were few passengers . __eou__ How about the passengers ? __eou__ Well , all the passengers and crew members landed on their feet finally . __eou__
There are some things I miss . But I love Chinese food.And I think the people in Taiwan are really hospitable.Besides , I grew up in Los Angeles , so I'm used to living in crowded places.Why are you going to America ? __eou__ I'm going to New York to visit my sister . She is in art school . I've never been to New York before . I'm kind of scared . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Well , I know a lot of people have guns there . I think maybe it isn't too safe . __eou__ Don't worry about it.Your sister lives there . She probably knows the places in town you shouldn't go.It ' s true there are some dangerous places in big American cities.But if your sister lives there , she must know the city pretty well already . __eou__ Yes , I'm not really scared . Maybe only a little . __eou__ Don't believe what you see on TV . You will have a good time in New York.What things do you want to see ? __eou__ I want to see the museums , and I want to shop a lot . __eou__ The museums are excellent . And the shopping ! Well ! I'm sure you'll spend a lot of money there . __eou__ Hmm . I hope not . __eou__
I'm thirsty . Pull over to that store , I'll buy some drinks . __eou__ I'm afraid I can't .

Good morning , Jerry.How ' s everything ? __eou__ Fine , just fine.Thanks . __eou__ Doing anything for lunch ? __eou__ Well , as a matter of fact , I've got a lunch date with Bob Thomas . __eou__
Excuse me . Can you tell me how to get started using these machines ? __eou__ Of course . Are you a new member here ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Welcome . My name is Johnson . __eou__ Nice to meet you . __eou__ Do you have any experience using weights ? __eou__ No , I don't . So I need some help . __eou__ Well , first it is important to go through a good stretch.You must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines . __eou__ Yes , I know that.Derek just led me through the warm up in the aerobics room.So I'm ready , I think . I can start using the machines . __eou__ Alright . Great . Then we must get a card for you . __eou__ What do you mean--a membership card ? I already have one . __eou__ No . Not that . I mean a training card.The card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine.Here , let me show you . __eou__ I'm ready . __eou__ Now , you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed.So , when you go through the series of twelve machines , you enter in the number of repetitions you do.And you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine . __eou__ I see . So this card helps me to keep track of my progress . __eou__ Yes . And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine.Today , I will go through the machines with you one by one . I will show you how to use them.And we will determine what is a good starting weight for you . __eou__ Alright . Great . __eou__ So you write your name and member number at the top of the card.And then , after you exercise each time , you file the card here . __eou__ Great . Why don't we start on the machines ? __eou__ Are you alright ? Can you do more ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I know there are still seven machines . But I'm exhausted . __eou__ That's okay . Don't worry.It ' s important not to push yourself . Especially not at the beginning . __eou__ What can I do though ? I don't know the proper settings for the rest of the machines . __eou__ We can just go through them next time . It's no problem . Really.The most important thing is to know your limits.So if you feel burned out now , it is good to stop.Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back , then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks . Right ? __eou__ Yes . I suppose it's best to stop . __eou__
Don't be afraid . Give it a try . __eou__ Okay . __eou__

What kind of games do you like ? __eou__ I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at ! __eou__ Doesn't everyone ? Which games are those ? __eou__ Well , I like to play darts . Whenever I go to a bar , I usually play for a few hours . __eou__ Did you play a lot of games when you were little ? __eou__ My parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes . We used to have family tournaments every weekend . __eou__ Do you still like playing those games ? __eou__ Not at all . I never really did , to be honest . What about you ? Did your family used to play games together ? __eou__ Everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games . __eou__ Some of my friends play cards on the internet . Have you ever tried that ? __eou__ No , I prefer to play with people I know . __eou__ How about mah-jong ? __eou__ It's a popular game with some people , but I've never played it . __eou__ I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong ! __eou__ I hate to disappoint you , but unlike what most people think , we aren't all exactly the same ! __eou__
I didn't like my brother's batting around without doing anything useful . __eou__ Maybe he is trying to find a job . When he finds one , everything will be settled . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__

We've got a new manager in our department . __eou__ Oh ? You hoped to get that job , didn't you ? __eou__ Yes , I did . __eou__ I'm sorry . That's too bad . Who is it ? Who got the job , I mean ? __eou__ Someone called Drexler . Carl Drexler . He's been with the company onlytwo years . I've been here longer . And I know more about the job , too __eou__ Hmm . Why do you think they gave it to him and not to you ? __eou__ Because I'm the wrong sex , of course ! __eou__ You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman ? __eou__ Yes , that was probably it ! It isn't fair . __eou__ What sort of clothes does he wear ? __eou__ A dark suit . White shirt . A tie . Why ? __eou__ Perhaps that had something to do with it . __eou__ You mean you think I didn't get the job because I come to work in jeansand a sweater ? __eou__ It's possible , isn't it ? __eou__ Do you really think I should wear different clothes ? __eou__ Well . . . perhaps you should think about it . __eou__ Why should I wear a skirt ?

You keep bowling spares but no strike . __eou__ I don't know why , but I think there's something wrong with my hands . I couldn't seem to be able to control it on the first ball . __eou__ I don't think it was the problem with your hands , you did several excellent spares . You have no problem with your hands . __eou__ Then why couldn't I get strike on the first ball ? __eou__ The problem is you are too nervous . You want to have a strike so much , so you deliver the ball too hard . And when it comes to the I second roll , there's no pressure . That's why you could bowl all those spares . __eou__ Really ? I will try again . __eou__

Since I was working part time , I had a difficult time keeping up with class . Now that we have exams coming up , I'm totally freaking out . __eou__ The best thing to do is study as much as you can . I'm sure you'll do alright . __eou__ I hope so . I guess I won't be sleeping for the next 3 days . That's what it'll take . __eou__ I have to study for an exam too . Why don't we study together . We can encourage each other . __eou__ That will be great . __eou__
The new webpage design is much more effective than before . I feel confident it will rope in a lot more business because of its user-friendly format . __eou__ Why do you think the new page is so much better than the old page ? I thought the old page wasn't half bad ... __eou__ The old page was okay , alright , but there wasn't a big influence in our sales volume , because the site wasn't developed with an eye towards the marketing aspect . Now it's different . We got our marketing department team in on the action , and the results are smashing ... __eou__ What changes were made from the old page to the new page ? __eou__ First , the visitors to the site are encouraged to give their contact information . They can sign up for a free monthly drawing . Once we've got their info , it goes into a database for future marketing mailers and advertising targeting . Also , there are clear links to descriptions of our products and services , so as to give confidence to new customers . We also added a specific area for on-line customer service ... So far we've gotten a ton of positive feedback ... __eou__ Great ! __eou__

Pardon me . Could you please pass me the tissue ? __eou__ Sure , here you are . __eou__ Thanks , I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . Are you ok ? __eou__ Yeah , I think the food is alright , it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me . But you are Chinese , you should have known better . __eou__ Well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies . __eou__ Oh , I see how this food can be really hard for you . I can sympathize with that . I stayed in Sichuan for a year . The food was difficult at the beginning . Every dish was so spicy . After a while though , I got used to the taste , and now I won't consider anything a real dish if it isn't spicy . __eou__ Yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , I haven't had the need or the opportunity . Every time I try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes . __eou__ I completely understand . I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choices , you've got to adapt . __eou__ Yeah , I guess that's a typical example of ' when in Rome , do as the Romans do . ' __eou__ Exactly . __eou__

Don't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted ? __eou__ Yes , at first I felt very awkward . After Bill was demoted and then resigned , it was kind of like somebody died ! I mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something . And then I was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to ... __eou__ Did they mutiny ? __eou__ Thankful , no . I guess everyone understands the opportunity I had to step into a leadership role is so great for my career . I'm really moving up the ladder now that I'm considered a supervisor . After a couple weeks , it was like nothing happened . __eou__ It is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work . supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them . __eou__ Yeah , and they also take the blame , that's what happened to my old boss ... __eou__
How about a game of tennis ? __eou__ Okay . Loser has to take out the trash for a month . __eou__ It's a deal . __eou__ See you in the court . __eou__
Are you feeling better today , Bill ? __eou__ Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening . __eou__ You'd better give up smoking . It's bad for your health . __eou__ You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit . __eou__ But you should make up your mind first . __eou__ You know , I often have to work till late at night . I need something to keep me awake . __eou__ Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work . __eou__ Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it . __eou__
Hi , John , how was your vacation ? __eou__ Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand . __eou__ That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ? __eou__ Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia . __eou__ Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ? __eou__ A little , but the rush was worth it . __eou__ Tell me about it . __eou__ We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us . __eou__ 500 feet ! I would never be able to do that . __eou__ Yeah , It was scary , but exhilarating . __eou__

It was even colder this morning . __eou__ Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow ? __eou__ I was watching the news a little earlier . They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow . __eou__ I really don't like the winter . I wish it were summer . __eou__ Me too .

Merry Christmas ! __eou__ Huh ? __eou__ I said Merry Christmas ! Don't you know that Christmas is almost here ? __eou__ It is ? Oh , that's nice . __eou__ Huh ? Didn't you know ? Aren't you excited ? __eou__ Actually , I'd forgotten about it . __eou__ Forgotten about it ? How could you ? __eou__ Because I'm not Christian , I'm Jewish . __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't know . __eou__ It's all right . There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I'm Christian . __eou__ I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ? __eou__ Well , I'll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that's not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I'll just enjoy the holiday break . __eou__ Well , would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house ? __eou__ Not at all . A party is a party . I'll be happy to come . __eou__
It's all over . I'm bankrupt . __eou__ Don't worry . Everything will be fine . __eou__
Bill , Happy Halloween ! __eou__ Happy Halloween ! What creature are you going to dress up as ? __eou__ I will dress up as a vampire with big fangs . __eou__ May I have a look at your costume ? __eou__ Sure . Wait a moment . ( Several minutes later ) Here you are . __eou__ I like your black clothes and your fangs are cool . __eou__ I will bite many beautiful girls on the neck tonight . Maybe I will suck their blood . __eou__ Haha . Wish you good luck . __eou__
I think that ’ s settled . __eou__ I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are ! __eou__ How dare you speak to me like this . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__
Hey , Karen . Look like you got some sun this weekend . __eou__ Yeah ? I guess so . I spent the weekend at beach . __eou__ That ’ s great . Where did you stay ? __eou__ Some friends of my parents live out there , and they invited me there . __eou__ So , what did you do out there ? I mean besides bask in the sun , obviously . __eou__ I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball . You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand . I couldn ’ t get through a whole game before I had to sit down . __eou__ Not to mention cooler . Did you go swimming ? __eou__ I wanted to , but the water is too cold , and I just wetted in up to my knees . __eou__ It all sounds so relaxing . I wish I could get away to the beach like that . __eou__ It looks like you could use it . Don ’ t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again . __eou__
OK class , so today we are going to continue with our anatomy class , today we will review everything we have learned . Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is ? __eou__ The brain ! __eou__ That's right , the brain ! It serves as a control center for the body , handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition . Then what major organ is in our chest ? __eou__ The heart ! __eou__ Very good ! It pumps blood throughout the body , using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins . Now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive ! Now what about the organs that help us digest food ? __eou__ The stomach and intestines ! __eou__ Very good ! Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the waste . Are we forgetting anything ? __eou__ Yeah ! Our kidneys , liver and bladder ! __eou__ Oh yes , you are right . Very important organs indeed . __eou__ So what do these organs do , teacher ? __eou__ Well , mumm , they ... Time for a break ! We can talk about it when you get back . __eou__

When you actually play , it can be very frustrating . __eou__

I need a little more practice before I invite guests over . __eou__ Looking at the spice rack , I ’ d say you ’ Ve been learning how to make asian food . __eou__ Yes .

I ’ m pretty good at making curries now , but I still need practice at making thai food . __eou__ Both kinds of food are becoming popular.Nowadays , it ’ s very easy to pick up the ingredients at the supermarket . __eou__ I hope you can stay for dinner .

Because floods of information are just a mouse click away , net users are very likely to become addicted to the web . __eou__ That's alright . I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information . It almost drives me crazy . __eou__ Then , you're probably addicted . __eou__
Sally , I ’ m tired of this Western food . I really miss my mother ’ s Sichuan cooking . __eou__ I ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ? __eou__ I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much . __eou__ I suppose you ’ re right , Lee . Maybe that ’ s why so many Westerners are overweight . __eou__ It ’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy . __eou__ You see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening . __eou__

She says it is very good . __eou__ Which one is that ? __eou__ You know , the one just on the corner with Oxford Street . There is a large pharmacy next door . __eou__ Oh yes , I know which one you mean . I have never been there , but I looked at their menu once and it did look good . __eou__ Okay then . I think we will all meet outside ? __eou__ What time ? __eou__ At 8 o'clock . I will make the reservation . __eou__ That's good . See you on Friday . __eou__
Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ? __eou__ No , I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ? __eou__ Yeah , I worked about twenty hours a week in a pizza restaurant . __eou__ What was that like ? __eou__ It was always very busy there . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I stood behind the register and took pizza orders . __eou__ Did you get any perks on the job ? __eou__ Yeah , I got to eat as much pizza as I could for free . __eou__
Did you like the play ? __eou__ Not really . It's a dull one , and the production isn't satisfactory , either . __eou__ You're absolutely right . The acting could be better . __eou__ To be fair , though , both the costumes and scenery are marvelous . __eou__
I need some books on hardware . __eou__ There's many books here.What about these ? __eou__ Great ! They're the very books I want.May I borrow two books ? __eou__ Sure.But you can only keep them for a week . __eou__ I see.Thank you . __eou__
I don ’ t know why I married him . __eou__ What is the matter ? __eou__ He never see eye to eye with me . __eou__ That is to say , love is blind . __eou__
Why is the long face ? __eou__ I'm getting sick of work man . I can't take the political bull in the company any more . __eou__ Did you just get your review or something ? __eou__ Yeah , but that's not why I am upset . I just found out another guy got a promotion . He doesn't know how to do anything . He sits there and kisses the managers butt all day long . __eou__ That sucks . __eou__ I'm just pissed that management can't see behind his smooth talking lies . __eou__ Look on the bright side . At least you have a job . __eou__ Yeah . I shouldn't stress about this anymore . It's not like I can do anything about it . __eou__ Exactly . Instead , we should have some drinks tonight . __eou__ How about a cold bottle of beer . __eou__ Now you're talking . __eou__
You're so witty ... __eou__ So why is the face tilted to the right ? __eou__ This watch is supposed to be worn on your left hand . __eou__ So it's not as convenient for left-handed people ? __eou__ It's better for right-handed people like me . See , I don't even have to move my arm to see the time . __eou__ I'm left-handed . You bought that watch so that I won't borrow it ... __eou__ Bingo ! __eou__
Is there any ticket left for tonight's concert ? __eou__ I am sorry , sir.All the tickets have been sold out . __eou__ What a shame . Will there be the same performance tomorrow evening ? __eou__ Sorry , sir . The only tickets of the same performance available are on 21st . __eou__ That's fine . I want 2 tickets . __eou__
Does Tom drink a lot ? __eou__ Yes , he does . He of ten has had one to many . But I advised him not to drink too much , he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table . __eou__ That's a problem . He has sort of Dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything . __eou__
Do you offer a course in business management ? __eou__ Yes , we do . __eou__ How many nights a week is it ? __eou__ It's 3 nights a week , Monday , Tuesday and Thursday . __eou__ And how long does the course last ? __eou__ It lasts for 9 months . __eou__ When does it start ? __eou__ The next beginning class starts on October 25th . __eou__ What time is the class ? __eou__ From 7 to 9 o'clock . __eou__ How much does it cost ? __eou__ It costs 125 dollars a month . __eou__ Yes , that's all right . I want to enroll in the course . __eou__ Thank you , please fill out this form for us . __eou__ Do you want me to fill it out now ? __eou__ Yes , please . We need a record of you education and your work experiences . __eou__

I have to pick up a lot of credits this year . __eou__ What ’ s your major ? __eou__ I ’ m majoring in French literature . __eou__ Oh , don ’ t you have to take that class on 18th century poetry ? It ’ s really difficult . I hear the students in that class have to write a paper 100 pages long . __eou__ That ’ s right . We got the assignment last week . __eou__ When is it due ? __eou__ Next Monday ! __eou__ Remind me never to sign up for that course ! __eou__

What would you do if you won the lottery ? __eou__ Let ’ s see ... If I won the lottery , I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world . __eou__ If you buy me a ticket I will go with you for sure ! __eou__ My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that ! __eou__ Alright this is a good one . What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married ? __eou__ If I told her that , she would faint and have me committed ! __eou__

I think I can handle it . __eou__ Well , if you change your mind , let me know . __eou__ I will . Thanks . That's sweet of you . __eou__ No problem . __eou__ I might need some tools though .

Seriously , I don ’ t mind helping . __eou__ OK . If you really insist , I could always use the company . __eou__
I've been standing here since half past seven . Where on earth have you been ? __eou__ I'm terribly sorry I'm late . I just couldn't help it . __eou__ It's really very easy saying you're sorry . __eou__ Look , just give me a chance . I can explain it . __eou__
Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ? __eou__ I suppose I do . __eou__ The climate here is pleasant . __eou__ They use said it __eou__ This city is really comfortable to living . __eou__ It sure is __eou__ No other city can match it . It's heaven . __eou__ Well , if you live in other as long enough you love them just as much . __eou__ Maybe . __eou__ That's for sure . __eou__
Do you know that Mary an Ben have already separated ? __eou__ Yeah , I know . __eou__ I didn ’ t know it until yesterday . I put my foot into it , and was even stupid enough to ask when they would get married . __eou__
Alice , your father is amazing . He ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house . __eou__ I know . He doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself ! __eou__ That sounds like my Grandmother . She was always stubbornly independent . __eou__ It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own . __eou__ They see their independence as a kind of character strength . __eou__ Sometimes they are too independent . __eou__
How are you making out ? __eou__ I'm doing fine.Don ' t mind me.It ' s a wonderful birthday party.Everyone is enjoying himself . __eou__ I hope so . Thank you again for your delightful gift . __eou__ Don't mention it . __eou__
Happy Birthday , Mary ! __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Here is a gift for you . I hope you like it . __eou__ What a lovely dog ! How did you know I love this ? __eou__ I had my own ways of finding out . It's a secret . You look so beautiful today . Your new shirt goes well with your skirt . __eou__ Maybe you don't believe it , but it was made by my grandmother . __eou__ Really ? It looks so nice . __eou__ Thank you . Please have a cup of tea . __eou__ All right . __eou__ How about some fish ? __eou__ No , thanks . I've had enough . Now , Mary , before you blow out the birthday candles , you have to make a wish . After that , you may cut the cake . __eou__ OK , let me make a wish ... Do you want a big piece of cake ? __eou__ No , just a small one . Next let's sing ' Happy Birthday ' to Mary . __eou__ It is very kind of you . I'm so moved by you . __eou__
How did you meet your girlfriend ? __eou__ I met Amanda through a friend . __eou__ That's great . Did you start dating right after you met , or did you become friends first ? __eou__ We started dating right away . __eou__

I haven't seen your father in like 5 years . How is he doing ? __eou__ He's not doing too well . __eou__ Why ? What's wrong ? __eou__ About a year ago , he started feeling weak all the time . __eou__ Is it due to old age or is he sick . __eou__ Maybe a little of both . The doctor's can't point out anything specifically . I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth . __eou__ That makes sense . It's important to take care of your health early in life . __eou__ That's what my father tells me almost everyday . __eou__ Well , I hope he starts feeling better . Say hi to him for me . __eou__ Thanks . I'll let him know . __eou__
Wedding rings ! __eou__ Oh , no ... __eou__ Aren't they cool ? I like the settings . __eou__ Jen , is there someone you're not telling me about ? __eou__ No . I just like looking at wedding rings , OK ? __eou__ Women are such dreamers . __eou__ These are specially designed for the year 2000 ! __eou__
Hurry up , get in . __eou__ I ’ m in , let ’ s go ! __eou__ OK , make a left here . . . no wait , I meant make a right . Come on , speed up ! __eou__ Geez ! What ’ s the rush ? __eou__ Don ’ t worry about it , just drive . Oh , no , the light is about to change . . . step on it ! __eou__ Are you nuts !

Move , move ! __eou__ What ’ s your problem ! Geez . Having a fit is not going to help ! __eou__ Here , I know a short cut ... just go down here , and we ’ ll cut though Ashburn Heights . Let ’ s go , let ’ s go ! Watch out for that lady ! __eou__ I ’ m going as fast as I can ! __eou__ Yes ! We made it . 5:58 , just before the library closes . __eou__ You ’ re such a geek ! __eou__
I've heard so much about Japan . Is it a beautiful country ? __eou__ Not everyone thinks Japan is beautiful , but to me its beauty is breathtaking.You feel the same way about France , don't you ? __eou__ Yes , I do feel the same way about France . The swift rivers , the fertile valleys , the large cities-its scenery is beautiful . Will you describe the geography of Japan ? __eou__ Well , it's made up of four large islands and many smaller islands located off the coast of the Asian main lands . France isn't an island , is it ? __eou__ Oh , no , France isn't an island . It is located in the western part of the European continent . But France does have many fine harbors and port cities on its southern and western coasts . Does Japan have good harbors ? __eou__ Good harbors ! Yokohama is one of the most famous port cities in the world , and Japan is the largest shipbuilding nation in the world . Also , there are long mountain ranges in the southern is hands . France isn't very mountainous , is it ? __eou__ No , France isn't very mountainous . But it does contain the Pyrenees , a large mountain range with high peaks and deep canyons . What kind of Climate does Japan have ? __eou__ The Japanese climate is warm and moist in the south , mild in the central part and cold in the north . Except for Hokkaido , we don't get much snowfall at all . France has a mild climate , doesn't it ? __eou__ Yes , the climate of France rarely has severe winters . In southern France , one can live in comfort the whole year . Is Japan good for farming ? __eou__ Yes , Japan is good for farming . Rice is the main crop , but Japan is also an industrial center . Fishing is very important , too . Rice isn't grown in France , is it ? __eou__ No , rice isn't grown in France . But farming , fishing and industry are also very important in France . I'd like to go to Japan some day . Would you like to visit France ? __eou__ Yes . I'd like to visit France . I'd like to travel all over the world . As you describe it , France seems to be very much like Japan . I would like to see it for myself . __eou__
I don't know why Mark often comes to me and asks me for advice . I smell some rat in it . __eou__ He is sly . He is actually angling for compliments . But he may have got the crush on you . __eou__ Nonsense ! There's no indication that he's in love with me . __eou__ Keep your fingers crossed . He may pop the question one of these days . __eou__
Hi , why do you look so depressed today , Mike ? __eou__ I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't . __eou__ I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ? __eou__ Yeah . It's so nice of you to comfort me . __eou__
Maybe we'd better go now . __eou__ It's still early . __eou__ Gosh , it's already 10.Stay here if you like . __eou__ Since we're late , let's go to see a film . __eou__ OK.Hurry up . __eou__
My uncle passed away last night . __eou__ My condolences . __eou__
Diana , in your opinion , which is more important , IQ or EQ ? __eou__ Why are you asking me the strange question , Jerry ? __eou__ I watched the movie Forrest Gump last night . And the question just lined in my mind . __eou__ Well . I think IQ matters more . But it won't work without EQ . __eou__ Why ? You seem pretty sure about it . __eou__ Because an intellectual mind can only be a beneficial thing in life . __eou__ But IQ is decided at birth.One can't expect to make a lot of improvement in it . __eou__ That's why people's achievement varies greatly . __eou__ That ' s true , but what if one comes across some difficulties . He must rely on his EQ to deal with them . __eou__ Yes , Jerry , can you share your understanding of EQ ? __eou__ I think it is independent of IQ and plays a prominent role in deciding the way we live our lives . __eou__ Quite right . Have you noticed that a high IQ is not a must for one's success ? __eou__ Just as Forrest ? __eou__ Yes , his IQ is high enough for him to embrace the success as long as he can manage his EQ . __eou__ I got it . __eou__
Come on ! It's time to go ! __eou__ Wait a minute ! Just hold your horses ! What's your hurry , anyway ? __eou__ Well , I've got to stop and get gas in the car , first . __eou__ That won't take long . __eou__ Well , it won't if there no line at the pump . __eou__ Well , I'm not quite ready . __eou__ I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you ! __eou__ You wouldn't do a thing like that ! __eou__ Oh , yes , I would ! __eou__
How's business ? __eou__ So so . __eou__
Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick . __eou__ Well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything . __eou__ Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous . and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back . __eou__ I ’ m thinking of taking you back home . I thought we could have a nice evening , but you ’ re always so negative . __eou__ I ’ m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage . __eou__ You see , that ’ s what I ’ m talking about , I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore __eou__ Next time , go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings . __eou__ Well he ’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories . __eou__ Love stories ? More like one-night-stands . __eou__ Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours ; they ’ re no saints . __eou__ My friends ? Fat ? What about those whales you call friends ? __eou__ You ’ re unbearable ; you can walk home , I ’ m leaving . __eou__
Which language do you speak ? __eou__ Well , I studied French at school , but I ’ Ve forgotten most of it . I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes . Do you speak Japanese at home with your parents ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I ’ m learning Chinese now on the internet . __eou__ How do you find studying a language on the internet ? __eou__ It ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good . __eou__ I bet you find the character difficult to write ! __eou__ Actually , many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese , so they ’ re easy for me . __eou__ So , you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers , right ? __eou__ Yes . How are the Spanish classes going ? __eou__ In a way , it ’ s similar to your experience of learning Chinese . Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones . But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself . __eou__
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? __eou__ Sorry , I thought you knew . __eou__ But you should tell me you were in love with her . __eou__ Didn't I ? __eou__ You know you didn't . __eou__ Well , I am telling you now . __eou__ Yes , but you might have told me before . __eou__ I didn't think you would be interested . __eou__ You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? __eou__ Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . __eou__ Oh , you men ! You are all the same . __eou__
So , did you go out with Richard ? __eou__ Yeah . We went to a movie last Saturday . We saw Police Partners II . __eou__ Did you like it ? __eou__ Richard did , but I didn't . Of course , I told him I liked it . __eou__ Yeah . So did you do anything else ? __eou__ Well , we went to a dance club . __eou__ Did you have fun there ? __eou__ Yeah , we had a great time . And we're going to go there again next week ! __eou__
Would you like to go to work or continue your studies after graduation ? __eou__ I think I will continue my studies . Now it's not easy for a graduate with bachelor's degree to get a job since there are so many graduates with master's or doctor's degree . We are likely to lose in competing with them in the job market . __eou__ So you will continue to study for a master's degree ? __eou__ Well , I think so . But I am thinking of going aboard to get a master's and doctor's degree . If can get a Ph . D . abroad , it will be much easy for me to get a job at home . __eou__ How can you finance your education abroad ? It is very expensive to study abroad . __eou__ I think I will try to get the scholarship since I really don't have so much money to study abroad . Actually now I am preparing for the TEFL and GRE exams . If I can get high marks in the two exams and if I am lucky enough , I may get a scholarship . __eou__ It could be pretty tough studying abroad . Being so far away from home ... __eou__
It's hard to get tickets for the movie . __eou__ Did you get any ? __eou__ Yeah , two at the tenth rows . __eou__ How much is the ticket ? __eou__ 3.5 dollars each . __eou__
What a great weekend that was ! __eou__ My feeling's exactly . __eou__ I really enjoy the beach in the summer . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . __eou__ We should come here more often . __eou__ You are absolutely right . __eou__ I'd like to come back next weekend . __eou__
I think Andy's party will be fun . __eou__ Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ? __eou__ Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ? __eou__ My boots ? Er ... Sure , ok . __eou__
Hi , Mr . Smith . Are you enjoying the cookout ? You don't look too happy . __eou__ I spent the morning at the cemetery . I put flowers on the graves of my old war buddies . __eou__ Is that what people usually do on Memorial Day ? __eou__ They should . This holiday is about remembering our war dead . But people these days think it's just a holiday for summer sales and cookouts ! __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . Thank you for telling me a little more about it . __eou__
I went to Super Junior's concert last night . It was fantastic . __eou__ Really ? Their songs are very popular all round Asia now . I am also a big fan of theirs . __eou__ Yes , their new album just came out last week . It is number one on the billboard . __eou__ I really love their dancing . They are all excellent dancers . __eou__ The lyrics of the new song are beautiful , too . Can you sing ? __eou__ Sure . I think you can hear the song everywhere you go now . __eou__ Let's go buy their new album . Want to come with me ? __eou__ Why not ? __eou__
I am a little nervous about my presentation on Friday . __eou__ If you would like me to , I could help you with that . __eou__ Wouldn't that take you away from your project ? __eou__ I have plenty of time to do this . I promise you it won't be a problem for me . __eou__ Is there a good time for you to help me ? __eou__ If we work on this tomorrow night , you could easily be ready by Friday . __eou__ How about meeting in my office ? __eou__ That would work out well . Bring any concerns that you might have . __eou__ Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot . __eou__ Don't worry . Everything will go well . I promise ! __eou__
If you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese ? __eou__ Why ? Did tom pop the question ? __eou__ Not yet . But I wonder if I can get my parents ’ consent . __eou__ Let me guess , your parents want you to marry a Chinese man , right ? __eou__ You are right . It is giving me a real headache . I feel like I ’ m between a rock and a hard place . __eou__ I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex . __eou__ Oh , how did you deal with it ? __eou__ I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend . But finally we broke up . __eou__ Oh , it ’ s a pity . What was the matter ? __eou__ Simple . We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ He hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family . __eou__ Oh , I see . In their culture women should put family first . __eou__ Yes , he said it would be better for me and for the whole family . But I simply can not quit working . __eou__ So that's why it ’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner . __eou__ Not really . There are many successful mixed marriage around us . __eou__
Where is Tom ? __eou__ He is in the bedroom and fallen asleep . __eou__ What ? It ’ s only 9p . m . Now . Why today he went to bed so early ? __eou__ He ran four miles and came back dead beat . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__
Hi , Ann . __eou__ Hi . You look excited . What's happening ? __eou__ I just heard that our school will hold a singing contest in 5 days . __eou__ And you're planning to enter ? __eou__ Of course . This is a great chance for me to show off my beautiful voice . __eou__ Is there a prize ? __eou__ I heard that the winner gets a Panda Radio . __eou__ Do you think you have a chance ? __eou__ A chance ? Not just a chance , I'm a hundred percent certain.Everyone says my voice is beautiful . __eou__ But you haven't practised all that much . __eou__ I still have 5 days to practise . It's in the bag ! __eou__ Don't be too sure . You're still going to need some help . __eou__ Yeah , maybe . __eou__
I've got to go to bed . Have to work tomorrow . __eou__ OK . Good night , then . Have a good sleep . __eou__ Good night . See you tomorrow . __eou__
I wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments . They are working very hard these days . Maybe it is time for everybody to relax a little . __eou__ That is a good idea , I love it . What time do you think is convenient ? __eou__ Well , what about this Thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ? __eou__ Ok , I will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . It has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . I am sure they don ’ t want to miss it . __eou__ I hope so . Let me know how many will come . Then I will book the restaurant . __eou__
What day is today ? __eou__ Today is Thursday . __eou__ What's the date today ? __eou__ Today is May first , 2003 . __eou__ Oh , today's International Labour Day . Is it our working day ? __eou__ Well , I don't think so . __eou__
Can you take part in our picnic this Saturday ? __eou__ That would be fine . Where are you going ? __eou__ We plan to go to a forest in the suburb . There is a beautiful river there . We can do some fishing . __eou__ Great . __eou__ And don't forget your fishing tackle . __eou__ Ok . I like fishing very much . __eou__
Daniel , what are you doing here ? Aren't you supposed to be at school now ? __eou__ The same question to you . __eou__ Well , we shall make it a secret between us . __eou__ Deal , Where is Gucci ? __eou__ She is the cheer-leader . They are required to put on a performance . Look ! Here they come . __eou__ Oh , look at her . She looks like one is the basketball babies in NBA . __eou__ I want to be like her . __eou__ Get real . Don't be so pathetic . __eou__ Hey , young man ! I'm your sis . Don't talk to me like that . __eou__ Oh , man , look at her , go ! She is amazing ! She should be my sis . __eou__ Boy , you've got such a crush on her , haven't you ? __eou__ Yes , I want to be her boyfriend . Just like in the movie . __eou__ Are you out of your mind ? __eou__ She told me she liked my new haircut . She thought it was cool . __eou__ Go ahead , have a try and be a joke . __eou__
You know John ? __eou__ Which John ? Mr.Turnbow ’ s son ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ Ve read news about him in today ’ s paper . __eou__ And he ’ s bright and intelligent .

But you must pay a deposit for the card . __eou__ There will be a refund when I return the card , right ? __eou__ Yes , if the card is well kept and has no dirt and scratches . __eou__ OK , here you are . __eou__
I am very proud of John . __eou__ Me too . No one has expected he can really get somewhere with his business . __eou__ But he has suffered a lot . __eou__
What do you think of the plan for the new airport near here ? __eou__ Perhaps they should give it a second thought . The residents are getting up in arms about it . __eou__ I think they will . __eou__
What do you think of that situation comedies showed every weekend ? __eou__ To tell you the truth , I don't think much of them . __eou__ You're becoming a real television watcher . __eou__ A lot of people feel the same way . __eou__
May I invite you for a dance ? __eou__ With pleasure . __eou__ You dance well . Do you breakdance ? __eou__ Me , what brought that on ? __eou__ There's a story about breakdancing in the paper . __eou__ What does it say ? __eou__ According to the story , it's some sort of modern dance style . __eou__ Like disco ? __eou__ Well , breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance . __eou__ And disco a kind of nightclub . __eou__ Right , a disco is a place where people dance according to nonstop recorded music ... __eou__ So ... disco is what the music is called and a disco is a place where people go to dance to it.And breakdancing is a different sort of thing altogether . __eou__ You are witty . __eou__
Could we borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend ? __eou__ That would be a possibility . Where is this fundraiser taking place ? __eou__ It is in the hotel ballroom down the street . __eou__ Do you need it for the whole weekend ? __eou__ We will need it for both days . __eou__ We will need to know who will be driving the van . __eou__ The van will be driven by Mary and me . __eou__ It needs to be back on Sunday night . Can you arrange for that ? __eou__ Oh yeah , no problem . Would you mind if we borrowed a few of the chairs from the lunchroom . __eou__ Just keep track of everything and get it all back where you took it from by Sunday evening . __eou__
Guess who I saw yesterday ? __eou__ I don't know . Who ? __eou__ Avril Lavigen ! __eou__ the Canadian rock singer ? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday . How did you see her ? __eou__ yeah , I worked as temporary staff in her concert . Look , her poster , a CD ... __eou__ so you're a big fan , eh ? __eou__ not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion and fashion designer , too . __eou__ and she was in a movie once again , right ? __eou__ yes , though I don't think her acting skills are that great . __eou__ what was your impression of her when you saw her in person ? __eou__ she looked sweeter than her pictures . __eou__ did you take a photo with her ? __eou__ no , there were too many people . When she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and ger her autographs . __eou__ crazy ! __eou__
Can you lend me fifty bucks ? __eou__ What ? Again ? Why do you keep running out of money ? __eou__ I guess I don't earn enough . __eou__ No , I think it's how you budget your life , that's the problem . __eou__ That's my business , not yours . __eou__ True enough , until the time comes that you need to take my money . I don't know where you're wasting your money but I think you need to take a look at what's really important . __eou__ So how do you survive from pay day to pay day ? __eou__ I don't just survive . I put money away as well . I know when I get paid where most of the cash will go , and I stick to my plan . If I follow a budget I don't have any nasty surprises . __eou__ I'm not disciplined enough I guess . __eou__ In a few months I'm planning to invest my money into some foreign companies . I think you need to reevaluate your spending habits . __eou__
How do you think the transport system in our city could be improved ? __eou__ I think that the public transport system could be made simpler . I never know where the bus routes actually go . The routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line . __eou__ I think we just need to build more roads . Then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams . __eou__ If we built more roads , people would just fill them with cars again . I think we should discourage people from using their cars . __eou__ How would you do that ? __eou__ I think we should do a few things at once . Improving public transport would encourage people to use that . If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much . __eou__ I don ’ t know . I think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money . They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax , for example . __eou__ I think that they should pay more tax . Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes . __eou__ The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city . The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom . It well be unpopular . __eou__ That ’ s a good point . Car owners will probably be against it , but people who use public transport will be in favor of it . __eou__
What day is today ? __eou__ Today is December twenty-third , two thousand and two . __eou__ Oh , The day after tomorrow is Christmas . __eou__ Merry Christmas to you . __eou__

The bridegroom looks a bit nervous . __eou__ On this occasion , most people do . __eou__ Oh , they are playing the wedding March . Here they come . __eou__ She is a beautiful bride . __eou__ I am so happy for them . __eou__ Are you crying ? __eou__ Yes , I always cry at weddings . __eou__ Harris and Anne are perfect for each other . __eou__ Yes , they are . __eou__ You and Tom also make a great couple . __eou__ In fact , we are beginning to make preparations . __eou__ For the wedding ? __eou__ No , no , for the engagement . __eou__ Try to catch this bouquet then . __eou__
Jessica is going back to Holland next week . I've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift , but I still have no clue . __eou__ is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with ? __eou__ yeah , that's her . We had a lot of wonderful times together . She is really a special friend , and I want to get her something meaningful . __eou__ I am not good at picking gifts . Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ? __eou__ I don't think so . That way it would lose all the charm . I want it to be a surprise . I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last . __eou__ yeah , that's nice . __eou__ hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home . __eou__ a plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to go through the customs ? __eou__ I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border . __eou__ I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble . __eou__
Have you got your invitation yet ? __eou__ My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ? __eou__ The house warming party . __eou__ Whose house warming party is it ? __eou__ Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house . __eou__ Oh , they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately . __eou__ It's out in the suburbs . __eou__ Have you seen the house ? __eou__ Yes , I have . I went out with them last weekend . __eou__ Is it nice ? __eou__ Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen . There's also a garden . __eou__ Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ? __eou__ They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight . __eou__ When are they going to have the party ? __eou__ Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow . __eou__ Wow , that would be something to look forward to . __eou__
Have you ever been to Xi ’ an ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ Ve been there several times on business trips . But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city . __eou__ I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place . __eou__ I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening . __eou__ Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ? __eou__ Well , the airport is quite far from the downtown area , but it is still more convenient than taking the train . __eou__
Tomorrow is Sunday . Let's go out and get some fresh air . __eou__ I know there is a beautiful farm in the countryside near Taipei . Are you interested in going there ? __eou__ why not ? I love animals and I love nature . __eou__ You can see many cows and horses there . lf you are brave enough , you can try horseback riding . it is fun . __eou__ sounds very interesting . I can't wait to go there . __eou__ Wow ! It is huge and you can do many activities here . __eou__ That is true . Some people go camping , some people pick fresh fruit , some people go boating and some people go grass skiing . __eou__ I never knew there were so many fun things to do on a farm . __eou__ Well , now you know . Let's go to the lake over there . Some people are fishing over there . I haven't had a chance to fish in a lake , I really want to try . __eou__ I think we need to buy some baits and borrow some fish poles first . __eou__ Yes . we can get what we need at the stands right by the lake . Who do you think will catch a big fish first ? __eou__ Of course . I will . __eou__ Wait and see . I want to try horseback riding after fishing . It looks very exciting and fun . __eou__ It is . However , you will suffer from muscle pain for many days you are a first-time rider . __eou__ No problem . It is always worth trying something new once in your life time . __eou__
how are you doing ? __eou__ I'm ok . I wish I could say the same for my friend . __eou__ what happened to him ? __eou__ he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving . __eou__ was it his first offence ? __eou__ unfortunately not . He was charged with a DUI when he was in university . __eou__ what happened to him then ? __eou__ not much ; it was a minor offence back then . He got away with a fine of $ 500 . __eou__ did they take his license away ? __eou__ no , they were really easy on him . The problem is that that was a long time ago . They are much tougher on crime now . __eou__ what do you think will happen to him ? __eou__ well , he'll definitely lose his license , pay a fine , and maybe even spend some time in jail . __eou__ that doesn't sound too promising . Does he have a defence lawyer ? __eou__ not yet . If we can't find a lawyer for him , then the state will appoint him with one . __eou__ my sister is a lawyer . I can ask her if she can help him . __eou__ that'd be great ! I know he'd appreciate your help . __eou__
Well , sir , we are asking all our guests to wear a jacket and a tie in our restaurant . __eou__ Is that so ?

I think we have the same musical tastes . __eou__ But if we're going to start a band , we have to be able to sing and dance .

What can you do to help me ? __eou__ I understand why you ’ re angry , Mrs . Wilson , and believe me , we are doing everything in our power to work this out . __eou__ Well , obviously , what you ’ re doing is not good enough ! __eou__ If you could just give us a few more days , we should be able to get this straightened out . __eou__
Can you tell me something about financial aid ? __eou__ What exactly ? __eou__ How to apply for it ? __eou__ In your first letter , that is , when you apply for admission , you should also tell them you need their financial aid . __eou__ Then ... __eou__ If the aid is available , they will give you two or more application forms , One is for admission , the others are for the aid . __eou__ What if not ? __eou__ They will tell you the aid is impossible . __eou__

What is there to do after we graduate ? __eou__ Every class reunion is organized by the president and council and anything our class does for the school in later years is headed by the president . __eou__ I'm honored that you think I would be qualified .

How is the college search going ? __eou__ It's a huge headache . I have no idea what I want to do . __eou__ But don't you want to study music ? Shouldn't it be easy ? __eou__ It should be , but there are too many options . My grades are good enough that I have a lot of choices , but after that ... __eou__ I know . You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country , a big school or a small school , a public or private school ... __eou__ Yup , you understand . And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college . They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline . And the tuition 3 is usually pretty low . __eou__ I see . Well , don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school . He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction.He gave me some information , and next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended . __eou__ Thanks for the information . And good luck in your college search . __eou__
I ’ m trying to decide what school to apply for . __eou__ Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure . What ’ s the difference between them ? __eou__ Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere . __eou__ Which is better ? __eou__ One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other .

Excuse me , Professor . I am going to miss next week's class . __eou__ Is this something that you could schedule for another time ? __eou__ No , I have to do this ; it's important ! __eou__ Have you arranged for someone to take notes for you ? __eou__ I've made arrangements with a friend to help me . __eou__ You know that I only allow one absence per semester , don't you ? __eou__ Yes , I know . __eou__ Write down your name and the date on a piece of paper and give it to me . __eou__ OK , I can do that . __eou__ Well , have a good day off from class . __eou__
It seems so strange to be here , burying you , but it's not you . __eou__ Ashes to ashes and dust to dust ... __eou__ This has been the worst and best day of my life , Taylor . They kept you in the hospital , and ... __eou__ I'll tell you all about it another day . __eou__ But you're OK ? It was nothing serious , was it ? __eou__ You ladies look very elegant in black .

The air quality in this city is horrendous . The pollution levels are so high that we are not supposed to go outside with a face mask again ! __eou__ Exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment . __eou__ On top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city . __eou__ As much as I love this city , I think I'm going to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health . __eou__ I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse effect . __eou__ What is the greenhouse effect exactly ? __eou__ It's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature . __eou__ I see , so it's similar to global warming ? __eou__ They're related to one another , yes . __eou__ I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live . __eou__ People joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well . __eou__ People always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations . __eou__ I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place . __eou__
What would you like to do tonight ? __eou__ I'm not sure . __eou__ What about going to a movie ? __eou__ OK , let's go to the cinema to see what's on . __eou__

I should thank you . __eou__ Shut up ! __eou__ No , listen to me . Perhaps it's my fault that I treat everybody so well . Maybe in other people's eyes , I want you to be my girl-friend . but ... but ... __eou__ But you have had lily already ? You should have told me about her , but you didn't . __eou__ OK ... OK ... Anyway . I will treat you as my best friend . I hope you can do the same . __eou__ Leave me ! Go away ! __eou__
Would you mind doing something for me ? __eou__ I would if I could . __eou__ Would you please explain the meaning of the word ? __eou__ Yes , With pleasure . __eou__

We have a subsidiary company l __eou__ Are the reports favorable ? __eou__ Generally , the reporters take positive lines . They do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of , but there ’ s nothing worrying in the reports . In the classifieds , one of our competitors is a __eou__ That ’ s interesting . They must be thinking of moving into that market . Are there any interesting editorials ? __eou__ Not really . They all seem to focus on the election . There have been several letters printed in the chronicle regarding that controversial article on drugs that they printed last week . __eou__ I ’ m not surprised . That article certainly added fuel to the debate . Ok . Thanks . Can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me ? I ’ d like to read them . __eou__ Sure . There you are . __eou__
Can you imagine a boat letting in the river ? __eou__ That would be terrible . __eou__ Sure thing . I have an experience like that . __eou__ Oh , how were you saved finally ? __eou__ I was in such a panic at that time . Fortunately another boat came along and I was saved from drowning . __eou__

He followed me all the way home ! __eou__ That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . __eou__ Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? __eou__ Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . __eou__ Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! __eou__ Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . __eou__ I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . __eou__ Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry . __eou__ Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . __eou__

How did you choose courses when you were abroad ? __eou__ That's a very good question . Choosing proper courses and effectively planning a college schedule is very important to the progress toward your educational goal . In order to do these wisely and effectively , you should consult with a Program Adviser or Academic Counselor . __eou__ Wait a minute . There are some new terms for me . I can hardly follow you . __eou__ Ok , I will go into more detail . A Program Adviser or an Academic Counselor is usually an experienced professor who is responsible for all the necessary academic counseling through graduation . You can discuss with him the program selection , changing or adding a program , the requirements for graduation , and other problems related to your study . You will choose some courses , and then discuss with the adviser whether your choice can meet the requirements for graduation . __eou__ Everything is so new to me . I think I'll have to experience a very difficult period when I get there . __eou__ Sure , very difficult . __eou__ I am very grateful for your advice . __eou__ It's my pleasure to talk with you . __eou__
So it is hard to be a black student on campus ? __eou__ Yes , in many ways it is . There are many stereotypes I have to deal with in my daily life . __eou__ Stereotypes ? Like what ? __eou__ Well , like since I'm black , I must like rap music , come from the inner city , or play basketball well . __eou__ I do know you like rap music , but the other two are definitely false . I ’ Ve seen you play basketball . __eou__ Hey ! But that's not the only problem . There's also the affirmative action stigma . __eou__ You mean that people look down upon you because they think you're in school because of a quota ? That's not true at all , you're really a smart guy . __eou__ I know that , but some people don't think like that . And I get problems from teachers as well . __eou__ Teachers ? I didn't think that they would be racist at all . __eou__ Racist ? Not exactly . It's how they look at me and ask for my opinion on a topic , as if I can speak for all black people and give them the black opinion on a subject . Suddenly I become the representative of the black race , as if we all had the same opinion . __eou__ I see . It looks like there are still a lot of issues we need to work on in the US . __eou__
Could you help me ? __eou__ What do you need ? __eou__ I can't seem to find my class . __eou__ What building is it in ? __eou__ It's in the C building . __eou__ Oh , I know exactly where that is . __eou__ Do you think you can tell me where it is ? __eou__ Sure , what room number is it ? __eou__ It's room number 261 . __eou__ I have a class around there right now . __eou__ Could you show me where it is ? __eou__ No problem , come on . __eou__
John , have you ever watched Beijing Opera ? __eou__ Yes , I watched once . __eou__ What do you think of it ? __eou__ Well , honestly speaking , I went to watch it out of curiosity . I'd say it's really a special art form . __eou__ I couldn't agree more . Actually , I'm a Beijing Opera fan . __eou__ Really ? Good for you . __eou__
Let ’ s play a game ! __eou__ OK ! How about Scrabble ? __eou__ No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is ! __eou__ OK ! __eou__ Let ’ s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples ! __eou__ Our cousin Pete ! My turn ! She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin ! __eou__ Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald ! __eou__ Your future husband ! __eou__ Not funny . __eou__
Hi Julie , how are things going ? __eou__ Everything is great , Tad . How are you ? __eou__ I'm doing really well . __eou__ Tad , I'm pretty hungry right now . Want to walk over and check out the food table ? __eou__ Julie , do you know who that woman is over there by the window ? __eou__ That is Mary . I heard that she's just moved in with Lee . __eou__ I thought that he was with Malia . __eou__ Oh , that relationship is history . Malia hooked up with a guy she met on holiday . __eou__ I bet that Lee wasn't too happy with that ! __eou__ Actually , he was OK with it . They hadn't been getting along too well . __eou__
You can take this car into consideration . It works well and its price is reasonable . __eou__ I was not born yesterday . __eou__
So , Emily , how was your day ? __eou__ I don't think you really want to hear about it . __eou__ It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it . __eou__ To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck ! __eou__ Why ? What happened ? __eou__ Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! __eou__ That's not very fair . What did you do ? __eou__ There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired for me for sure . __eou__ Does he treat everyone in your department like this ? __eou__ He treats everyone pretty poorly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! __eou__ Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ? __eou__ I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! __eou__ Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company ? __eou__ Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion . __eou__ That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on you shoulders . __eou__ I try to be sensible about it , but it's not very easy . Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it . __eou__ That's so true . When you have a taste for success , you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way . __eou__
Can you speak English ? __eou__ Yes I can . I speak it very well . __eou__ Where did you learn it ? __eou__ I lived in England when I was a child . __eou__ What else can you speak ? __eou__ Well , I know a little Italian . __eou__
Hi , Maggy , Did you hear about David ? __eou__ About David , No , I didn ’ t hear anything . __eou__ You know , about David and new boss . __eou__ Sorry , I don ’ t quite follow you . __eou__ Well , I hear David have been fired . __eou__ Oh , that is a shame . He is really hard working . __eou__
How would you describe your relationship with our boss ? __eou__ We have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot . __eou__ What do you think his strengths are ? __eou__ Well , he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations . __eou__
Which school is your children in ? __eou__ She is now in a private school . __eou__ Oh , it costs too much . It's more expensive than the public school . __eou__ It's idea of my husband . He is always banging the drum for better schools . __eou__ But the private school amount to better schools . __eou__
I am very interested in a new apartment near the Taxing Plaza , but the price is very high , I really can't afford it . __eou__ How much is it for each square meter ? How large is the apartment ? __eou__ It's 7500 yuan per square meter , and I really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room . Its total area is about 80 square meters . __eou__ That surely will cost you a lot of money . Are you going to make a full payment ? __eou__ Do you think I am rich enough to make it ? I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments . The real estate agency says if I pay a 25 % down payment , I can move in at once . __eou__ If sounds so tempting . Why not go applying for a loan from the bank ? They charge very low interest , so you can choose whether to pay up the balance in 10 or 20 years . __eou__
I really like the record you lent me the other day . __eou__ I'm glad you like it . __eou__ And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long . __eou__ Not at all . __eou__ I'm most grateful . Everyone in our class enjoyed it . __eou__ I'm glad . __eou__ Would you mind my keeping it for another week ? __eou__
We'd like to have a look around your house ? __eou__ Yes , of course , please follow me . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ This is our courtyard . __eou__ It's so spacious , about 40 square metres , right ? __eou__ Yes , about 46 square metres . __eou__ Are these corn ears hanging on the tree branch ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Very beautiful and very interesting . But why do you hang them in the tree ? __eou__ They don't have enough time to peel it after they harvested them , so they hung them in the tree . Then in winter , they can peel corn ears in their leisure time . __eou__ Very good idea . Sometimes such pictures can show the house's richness . __eou__
So , where are you going to spend your winter vacation ? __eou__ Oh , I ’ m going to meet my girlfriend in Thailand . __eou__ You have a girlfriend in Thailand ? Interesting . How come I have never heard of that ? __eou__ Actually it will be my first time to meet her . __eou__ You mean you haven ’ t seen her before ? Then , how could she be your girlfriend ? Maybe you don ’ t even know her . __eou__ That ’ s true . But we have known each other over the Internet for a few months now . Actually we are on an intimate level . We even plan to be engaged next month . __eou__ Congratulations ! It ’ s good to follow your heart . But I just didn ’ t expect to be so fast . __eou__ The Internet is making interaction much faster . People are getting to know each other much more quickly this way . __eou__ Probably you ’ re right . __eou__
Hi ! Susan ! I haven't seen you for ages ! __eou__ I've been really busy . How is everything ? __eou__ Oh , fine . Hey , why don't we grab a bite to eat and do some catching up ? __eou__ Yeah , why not ? I've got a little free time on my hands . Where do you want to eat ? __eou__
Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! And we ’ ll be able to relax in the sun while they ’ re playing . __eou__ It does seem like the perfect day ! I ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp . Here , Mary , help me lay down these beach towels . __eou__ There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect . __eou__ Ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee , a pail and a shovel . I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . Don ’ t stray too far . Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes . __eou__ And stay in the shallow area . I don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier . __eou__ You ’ re back already ? The water was too cold , huh ? I ’ ll tell you a secret . Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ’ ll be warmer in there . Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows . __eou__ What is that ? A jellyfish ? Jeremy , put that down right now ! It could sting you ! __eou__ Ah ! Not on me ! Ow ! __eou__
Hello __eou__ Hi Angela , it's Dan . __eou__ Hi B . How are you ? __eou__ Good . __eou__ I called you yesterday . Did you get my message ? __eou__ Yes , I was taking a shower when you called . I saw that you called and I tried to call you back , but I think your phone was off . __eou__ No problem . I wanted to remind you that my friend is getting married next week . You're still coming to the wedding with me , right ? __eou__ Oh , is that next week ? __eou__ Yes . Did you forget ? __eou__ No , of course not . I already bought them a present . __eou__ That's good . I want to invite Megan also . Next time you see her , can you tell her for me . __eou__ Sure . Does she know your friend ? __eou__ Yes , I think they might have gone to the same college or something like that . I'm not exactly sure how they know each other . __eou__ Are we all going to drive together ? __eou__ Yes . I'll pick you up first , and then we'll go get Megan . __eou__
Hey , look at the offer I got in my e-mail . It says that I can get rich quickly while working at home ! __eou__ Do you also believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I mean that you're gullible . You shouldn't believe everything you read , especially on the Internet . __eou__ But it seems like a good idea . All I have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter . After that he'll tell me how to earn much more money . __eou__ Sounds like a pyramid scheme . Have you heard of those before ? __eou__ Pyramid scheme ? What is that ? __eou__ It's a scam 7 that's based on a hierarchy , like a pyramid . The person at the top asks the people below him for money , and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him . __eou__ Sounds good to me . The guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him . __eou__ Not exactly . The scam keeps on going , with the people at the bottom paying more and more money until they reach the very bottom . __eou__ What happens then ? __eou__ Nothing . The people at the bottom give their money to the people above them , and they get nothing . They end up losing . That's why it's a scam . __eou__ I see . I guess I should be more careful about what I read , especially on the Internet where you have no idea who anybody is . __eou__
We've been cramming for tomorrow's history exam since early this morning . What do you say we take a break and listen to some music , okay ? __eou__ Now that you mention it , I'm getting a little bumed-out from studying nonstop , too . Listening to some music for a while would suit me just fine . __eou__ While you're picking out a record to play , I'll grab a couple of beers out of the refrigerator . __eou__ You sure have a lot of discs here . __eou__ Yeah , I've got everything from rock n ' roll to the latest new - wave stuff . __eou__ To tell you the truth , I'm strictly into classical music . You don't happen to have any Bach or Mozart , do you ? __eou__ Sorry , my taste in music doesn't go back any further than the 1960 ' s . Music written before then is just history to me . __eou__ Well , speaking of history , let's get back to the books.We ' Ve got an exam tomorrow , remember ? __eou__
When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ? __eou__ Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter . __eou__ How about Sunday then ? __eou__ Yes , Sunday sounds fine . What time ? __eou__ Does 6,30 suit you ? __eou__ It suits us fine . We ’ ll see you then . __eou__ Thanks , goodbye . __eou__
I was thinking of holding the company retreat in the mountains . __eou__ I agree , I think that that would be perfect ! __eou__ I was thinking it could take place sometime in January . __eou__ That might be a little too cold for some people . __eou__ Yes , you are right . __eou__ What about April ? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot . __eou__ Yes , that would work out better . __eou__ You know , maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone . __eou__ Good idea ! We'll have to get right on it . __eou__ Fine ! Well , I'll get right on it now ! __eou__
How may I help you ? __eou__ I need to check these books out . __eou__ Do you have your library card ? __eou__ Here it is . __eou__ It appears that you have late fees . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , really . __eou__ How much do I owe ? __eou__ You owe $ 24.50 in late fees . __eou__ I don ’ t have that much today . __eou__ I ’ m sorry , but until you pay it , you won ’ t be able to check out any more books . __eou__ I ’ ll pay it as soon as possible . __eou__
Merry Christmas ! __eou__ Huh ? __eou__ I said Merry Christmas ! Don ’ t you know that Christmas is almost here ? __eou__ It is ? Oh , that ’ s nice . __eou__ Huh ? Didn ’ t you know ? Aren ’ t you excited ? __eou__ Actually , I ’ d forgotten about it . __eou__ Forgotten about it ? How could you ? __eou__ Because I ’ m not Christian , I ’ m Jewish . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know . __eou__ It ’ s all right . There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I ’ m Christian . __eou__ I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ? __eou__ Well , I ’ ll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that ’ s not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I ’ ll just enjoy the holiday break . __eou__ Well , would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house ? __eou__ Not at all . A party is a party . I ’ ll be happy to come . __eou__
Do you want to go shopping with me ? __eou__ That's a good idea.What time is good for you ? __eou__ How about Saturday morning ? __eou__ Sounds good . __eou__
Welcome , young man . No offence , but I haven't seen you here before . __eou__ Of course , this is my first time here . My Mom has a membership here . Here is the card . __eou__ Okay then . You are the younger customer here ever . __eou__ It's not so wise that you do not explore the children's market . __eou__ It's the marketing's fault , I suppose.What do you want to do ? __eou__ Well , I want to become just like Bruce Lee . What should I do ? __eou__ That's a long way to go , I'm afraid . First of all , you gotta grow up . __eou__ I am still young . And I'm growing every minute . __eou__ Sure . Then what about trying the treadmill or the skipping rope . __eou__ I love running . Anything else ? __eou__ Please change your clothes first ! __eou__ I'm perfect with my clothes . And I do not have anything else with me . __eou__ Sorry , but no jeans here . __eou__ Oh , that's the only place where jeans are not popular . I'd better just go home . __eou__
I hear that the Students ' Union is going to take new members . __eou__ Really ? Can I join it ? __eou__ Of course you can if you like it . __eou__ How can I join it ? __eou__ There will be an information session about the Students ' Union this Tuesday . You can apply for it then . __eou__ OK , thank you . __eou__
Is that girl your girlfriend ? __eou__ No , it's not . __eou__ She doesn't look like our classmate . __eou__ Don't mistake her as somebody . She ' s my older sister . __eou__ Really , she's so pretty . __eou__
What do you do in summer ? __eou__ I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride . I love being out in the fresh summer air . How about you ? __eou__ I don ’ t often go for walks , but I either play sports outside-you know , tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book . __eou__ What do you do in winter ? __eou__ Well , I play sports indoors quite often . If I ’ m feeling lazy , I just watch a film at home . I prefer summer to winter . __eou__ I think most people do . I like wearing nice , colorful clothes in summer , you know , a nice dress or skirt . It ’ s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter . __eou__ Yes . I like wearing shorts in summer . My legs would freeze ! __eou__ Do you think we ’ ll have a nice summer this year ? __eou__ Thanks to global warming , it could be hotter than ever ! __eou__
Happy new year ! __eou__ Thank you . Same to you . __eou__ Have you got any plans ? __eou__ I've been invited over to a friend ’ s , and you ? __eou__ My roommate ’ s having a party . __eou__
Do you offer a course in business management ? __eou__ Yes , we do . __eou__ How many nights a week is it ? __eou__ It's 3 nights a week , Monday , Tuesday and Thursday . __eou__ And how long does the course last ? __eou__ It lasts for 9 months . __eou__ When does it start ? __eou__ The next beginning class starts on October 25th . __eou__ What time is the class ? __eou__ From 7 to 9 o'clock . __eou__ How much does it cost ? __eou__ It costs 125 dollars a month . __eou__ Yes , that's all right . I want to enroll in the course . __eou__ Thank you , please fill out this form for us . __eou__ Do you want me to fill it out now ? __eou__ Yes , please . we need a record of you education and your work experiences . __eou__
Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ? __eou__ I think housing is a big problem . There are thousands of homeless people on the streets . __eou__ How would you solve the problem ? __eou__ I have a good idea to solve it . The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes . __eou__ It would probably be very expensive . __eou__ I think the government can afford it . Besides , there are many advantages . Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs i __eou__ It ’ s not a bad idea . I think education is the biggest problem at the moment . Schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly . __eou__ If we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . That wouldn ’ t be popular with voters . __eou__ Most voters what everything both ways . They want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes . __eou__ The government should show that it is using money efficiently . Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project . __eou__ Yes . The government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly __eou__
Do you keep any pets , such as cats , dogs ? __eou__ No , I'm scared of cats . __eou__ Oh , but why ? __eou__ I feel they're dirty . __eou__
Would you like to see our new shirts ? __eou__ Sorry , but I ’ m not really that interested in those things . __eou__ Well , they are very nice you know . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ And not expensive either . __eou__ Oh , I don't care about that . __eou__ Everybody is buying them . __eou__ Are they ? __eou__ Yes , they are very fashionable , you see . __eou__ I am afraid I am not interested in fashion . __eou__ I see . __eou__ But thank you very much all the same . __eou__ Sorry I couldn't help you . __eou__
Come in , come in ! __eou__ Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ? __eou__ I thought we were supposed to meet HERE . __eou__ Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other . __eou__ Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ? __eou__ You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie . __eou__ It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning . __eou__
how was school today , Dominic ? __eou__ I hate school ! __eou__ why ? What happened ? __eou__ I messed up my mid-term exam so badly today ! __eou__ it's just one exam . Can you re-take the exam ? __eou__ yes , but it's so humiliating ! I don't want my friends to know I failed ! __eou__ why didn't you do a good job ? __eou__ I don't know . I sat down in my seat , looked at my paper , and then my mind just went totally blank . __eou__ do you think you studied enough for the exam ? __eou__ no ... __eou__ what did you do last night ? __eou__ I watched TV . __eou__ did you study at all last night for your exam ? __eou__ no , not really . __eou__ I am sure if you had studied , you would have done well . When can you re-take your exam ? __eou__ tomorrow . __eou__ alright . Get out your books and I'll help you prepare . __eou__
I haven't met the Smiths for a long time . __eou__ They have moved to Chicago . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Mr.Smith has changed his job . __eou__
Did you hear about Joe ? She hasn't eaten for days . __eou__ Why ? What's eating her ? __eou__ Love sick . You know who she's in love with ? __eou__ I don't have the slightest idea . __eou__ Someone you're living with . __eou__ What ? Not my Dad , I hope ! ? __eou__ Come on , Mary , it's your brother , Jack . __eou__ No kidding ! Jack is such a log ! He's never dated a girl . __eou__ The problem with Joe is that she's too shy to tell him . __eou__ And the problem with Jack is that he seems to have no interest in girls . He's putting his heart into his stamp collection . __eou__ Well , if you want to help your friend , you should do something about it . __eou__
Oh , they all went out ! Did you make a wish ? __eou__ Yes , but I doubt if I get it . I've never got it . __eou__ Better luck this time ! __eou__
How do you like the food sold in this sidewalk snack booth ? __eou__ At least , it is better than my boxed lunch at work . I'm so fed up with the bland food . Thank you for having lunch with me ! __eou__ Any time . But I don't mind eating boxed lunch . The food sanitation is really good too . __eou__ It's hard to believe that you like it . You are so easy to be satisfied . __eou__ Hey , it's not that bad . The food is nutritious and it's really convenient . I don't want to spend too much time on eating stuff . __eou__ Eating is important . You are what you eat . It's not only a daily routine . __eou__ Well , will you just go back to work after lunch ? __eou__ No . I'm going to pay the bill for the company's lunch . __eou__ But you didn't eat anything today . __eou__ Well , the bill is paid by month . That's probably the only thing that I like about a take-out restaurant . __eou__ All right . I'm going to the McDonald's . __eou__ For what ? I thought you didn't like western food . __eou__ No , I never did . It's for my son . He loves it , and I made an agreement with him that he can eat it once a week . __eou__ That's really smart . My son Daniel is the same with your son . I just don't get it , why all the kids prefer western food to traditional food . __eou__ Me , either . But , it's for sure that the children market is a really big one . __eou__ That's for sure . It's always hard for the parents to say no to their children . __eou__
What can I do for you today ? __eou__ I need to return a book . __eou__ Can I do anything else for you ? __eou__ I want to check these books out . __eou__ Is that all ? __eou__ That ’ s all . __eou__ May I see your library card , please ? __eou__ It ’ s right here . __eou__ Will that be all for today ? __eou__ Yes . That ’ s it . __eou__ These are due back in two weeks . __eou__ All right . Have a good night . __eou__
Which sports are popular in your country ? __eou__ Most people like football . More boys like football than girls . A few girls play it really well . Some people like playing basketball . __eou__ Do many people like tennis ? __eou__ More and more people like it now . fewer people play table tennis than before . Many people like swimming , because it is fun and keeps you fit . __eou__ In my country , many people enjoy golf , but it is too expensive for some people . A few people like extreme sports , but I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them . __eou__ Extreme sports are only for a small minority of people . Several people from my university enjoy them , but most of us just watch . No one I know plays golf . __eou__ I know loads of people who play it regularly . There are plenty of golf courses around the country . In the past , only a tiny number of people played . __eou__ A great deal of people follow rugby in my country . __eou__ There are plenty of rugby fans in my country too . __eou__
Thank you for letting me borrow your portable CD player . __eou__ Oh , you're welcome . __eou__
You seem to be in the seventh heaven . What's put you on ? __eou__ Sarah and I could see eye to eye with each other . __eou__ Did she give up her decision to marry Dick ? __eou__ No , I encourage her to go her own way , but she's now having a change of heart . __eou__
I've come to say goodbye . __eou__ When do you leave ? __eou__ I'm catching the eleven o'clock train . __eou__ Take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch . __eou__ Goodbye . Hope to see you again next year . __eou__
The weather is terrible . __eou__ Yes . It was sunny and warm yesterday but the wind is really blowing hard now . __eou__ I'm wearing my heavy jacket . __eou__ I'm going to put on more clothes , too . __eou__ Will it snow today ? __eou__ I don't know . Do you like snowing ? __eou__ Yes , when it snows , every where is white . It's very beautiful . __eou__ You can read the newspaper . Maybe it will tell you whether it will snow or not . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__
This city is far too polluted . We should do something about it . __eou__ I agree . We need to recycle our trash and use public transportation more often . __eou__
I am looking for a comfortable convenient way to see the country . __eou__ Have you heard of motor coaching ? It's one of the fastest-growing segments for the travel industry . __eou__ No , I've not heard of it . Tell me about it . __eou__ It's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land . Everything is planned for you from the moment you step on board a luxury coach . __eou__ Is it just a bus ? __eou__ Oh . no .

Fresh start to accomplish any dreams , objectives and goals . __eou__ Do you have a New Year's resolution ? __eou__ I was thinking about it , but I'm never able to keep my New Year's resolution .

Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time , or doing some volunteering work . __eou__ That seems reasonable . We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square . __eou__ Sure , as long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight ! __eou__ Well , we can't break tradition ! It's bad luck ! __eou__

I ’ d love to have my own farm . __eou__ It would be very hard work . Are you sure ? __eou__ I wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy . __eou__ Running a farm would be totally different to you current job . __eou__ That ’ s one reason I ’ d like to try it . I ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office . __eou__ You ’ d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer . It ’ s not something you can just walk into . __eou__ My uncle owns a farm and I ’ Ve spent some time working with him . I love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields . __eou__ Well , I ‘ d certainly come and visit you . It would be great to take a working holiday on a farm . I ’ d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while . __eou__
We still have one more day to go before we return home . What will we see tomorrow ? __eou__ no idea . We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . What else is there to see ? __eou__ what about a factory tour ? __eou__ you mean visit a factory ? __eou__ yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry . __eou__ good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ? __eou__ I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour . __eou__ really ? What do the companies do that for ? __eou__ I believe most of them think of it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known . __eou__ oh , i see . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors . __eou__ exactly . __eou__ do we need an appointment beforehand ? __eou__ I'll call the tourist information centre to check . __eou__
Look , here're two coins named Kai Yuan Tong Bao — the sort of coin made in memory of the founding of a new dynasty . These two coins were made in different periods of the Tang Dynasty . __eou__ How can you tell the difference ? From what I see , they look almost the same . __eou__ The one made in the early Tang period is bigger and has more characters on it , while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late Tang period . Look carefully , and tell me if you see the difference now . __eou__ Yes , they are different ! But it's too professional . What I need is just being able to tell the real from the fake . Do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin ? __eou__ Various methods were used in history to produce fake coins . We usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines . We can judge it with naked eyes . __eou__ I see . By the way , China was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history . Did they issue their own coins in China ? __eou__ Certainly , they did . Liao Coins and Song Coins , for example , coexisted in circulation during the Southern Song and Yuan period some 800 -1000 years ago . The Liao Coins look plain and bold in style , just like the characteristics of the Mongolian tribe . Let me look for one and show you . __eou__ If you happen to find one , please bargain with the owner for it . I'd like to have one . It's interesting to see the integration of the Han and Mongolian cultures on this small piece of metal . __eou__
There will be another sandstorm here tomorrow . __eou__ It's the fourth one this year . Isn't it horrible . __eou__ Yes . We should plant more trees and grass to stop the sand from spreading . __eou__ It may take many years for the trees to grow . I hope people will stop cutting down trees . __eou__ But we need the wood . __eou__ But we can't destroy our forests to get the wood . __eou__
What are you guys doing ? __eou__ Just having a chat . __eou__
What ’ s wrong with you , Mr . Polly ? __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? I want a break from this horrible job . __eou__ Then , buy a bottle of soft drink . __eou__ Would you like to buy a bottle for me in the shop ? __eou__ It ’ s a problem , because my boss is in that shop now . __eou__ Ok , I will go there myself . __eou__ Sorry , Mr . Polly . __eou__ It doesn ’ t matter . Oh , God , I have only four dollars in my wallet . Is that possible for me to buy one ? __eou__ Have a try . __eou__

What ’ s the first thing you do when you go to the bathroom in the morning ? __eou__ I look at myself in the mirror .

Sometimes I need a cold shower to wake me up and sometimes I need a hot one , especially if it ’ s winter and I need to warm up . __eou__ Do you shave every morning ? __eou__ I shave every workday , but I only shave at weekends if I ’ m going out somewhere .

I must see your receipt . You can't have your money back without receipt . __eou__ Oh , I'm not certain , but I think I've lost it . __eou__

Let me clear away the broken glass . __eou__ No , I can manage it myself.Just sit down , please . __eou__ It's very careless of me to have broken your glass . __eou__ Never mind . __eou__
Have you followed the value of dollar lately ? __eou__ How could I help but follow it ? The fluctuation of dollar is killing my company ! The exchange rates are eating into our profits , and we can't do anything about it . __eou__ It's really frustrating , isn't it ? I have the same problem . I would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . With the way the dollar plummeting lately , my securities have gone up in smoke . __eou__ Every day I have less money ! I haven't spent anything , it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate . __eou__ What we really should be making investment in is the Euro . I've followed the Euro's progress over the last quarter , I think it's about time to buy in . __eou__ What about the Yen ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? The Yen is in worse shape than the Dollar ! __eou__
What a lovely day . The sun is shinning and the sky is so blue . It's a perfect day to go to the beach and get a beautiful tan . __eou__ Great idea . Unlike you , I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand . I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin . __eou__ Come on . Getting a tan symbolizes health and wealth in western countries . __eou__ While the pale color symbolizes beauty and elegance in most Asia countries . __eou__ That is a really interesting fact . __eou__ I will bring a big hat and apply a lot of sunscreen before setting off the beach . __eou__ Just do whatever you feel like doing . __eou__ ( At the beach ) My bag is so heavy . Let's put the stuff under the tree . __eou__ Good idea . It is always cooler in a shade . __eou__ I can't wait to play in the water . My feet are burning when I stand on the sand . __eou__

I just moved here a few months ago . __eou__ where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from China . What about you ? __eou__ I am from Texas . I was in China once , but it was a long time ago . __eou__ did you enjoy it ? __eou__ I did . I especially liked the food . What do you think about the food here ? __eou__ it's very different from Chinese food , but I am getting used to it . __eou__ Is that the Da Vinci Code that you've got there ? __eou__ yes , have you read it ? __eou__ no , but I saw the movie . What do you think about it ? __eou__ well , to be honest , I've only gotten though 10 pages of it .

It's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh . __eou__ ( After they entering the park ) Great , it's so quiet here . We have the park to ourselves , only you and me . __eou__ Are you kidding ? Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your right . __eou__ Oh , I see them . Beautiful weather should be shared by all the people . __eou__ Ah , you changed so fast . __eou__
How was the party last night ? Did you enjoy it ? __eou__ Oh , don ’ t talk to me about last night ! It was the most awful evening I ’ Ve ever had . __eou__ Why ? What happened ? __eou__ Well . Mary had promised to be my date , but she stood me up . I waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind . __eou__ What about the party ? __eou__ It was boring . The music was too slow and the food was lousy and , above all , I was really sick of the same old crowd all the time . __eou__ So how long did you stay ? __eou__ I left after the opening dance . I couldn ’ t wait to get out of there . __eou__
Do you think my briefcase is big enough to put in all these stuff ? __eou__ Let me see . Laptop , flash disk , a ballpoint pen , a pencil , a notebook , a pair of glasses , cell phone , charger , moisture , notion , ... Oh , that is too much . You are not going to a business trip . __eou__ I guess I need all of them . __eou__ Actually , the company will provide you with all of these supplies . So , you can leave this very thick notebook at home . __eou__ I know . But it is my lucky charm . I carry it all the time . __eou__ Suit yourself . Don ’ t forget to set the alarm clock . __eou__
Why do all girls appear feminine after sophomore year ? __eou__ Because they are full-grown . Look at their curvy figures . __eou__ I feel they all talk and behave in a different way . __eou__ They suddenly become shy when they speak to boys . __eou__ Some even do make-up slightly . Are you aware that previous ' small potato ' Ma Xiaoxiao becomes a piece of cheese cake recently ? __eou__ She is certainly not my kind of girl . __eou__ Stop preaching your dream love Marilyn Monroe to me . I know those sexy women are your tastes . __eou__ You are so Platonic . Those naive girls will eventually grow into real women . They can't resist love , and men cannot resist their attraction either . __eou__ I appreciate the saying ' Love consists in this , that two solitude protect , border and salute each other . ' __eou__

She's like that with everyone . __eou__ I don't think so actually . She never even says " hello " to me . __eou__

Maybe going around for a while . __eou__ Well , have you ever thought about learning some Chinese ? __eou__ Actually , I am learning that now . But it's too hard for me . You know the four tones and the stuff . It really freaks me out . __eou__ Don't worry . All things are difficult before they are easy . __eou__ You hit the nail right on the head . __eou__ Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ? __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ It's where I teach you Chinese , and in exchange you teach me English . __eou__ Awesome .

He may probably give you the bag . __eou__ I'm sure of what I'm doing . __eou__
Hey , Leo . How come you look so terrible ? What ’ s going ’ on ? __eou__ You can say that again . Susan ’ brother dropped in from out of town , so I offered to put him up for a few days . But he ’ s driving me up a wall . This guy is bottomless pit . __eou__ How gross ! I can ’ t handle people like that . Does he at least give you a hand around the house ? __eou__ He doesn ’ t lift a finger ! I bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon . __eou__ Man , what a freeloader . You better do something quick or he ’ ll never hit the road . After all , he ’ s got it made in the shade here . __eou__ You think he might stay even longer ? ! __eou__ Now , don ’ t go losing your temper . If you tolerated all you can , just kick him out ... but do it with gloves . I know ! Tell him a white lie like you ’ re getting the house fumigated ! __eou__ That wouldn ’ t be a lie ! __eou__
I've got an idea . Let's make this game even more interesting . __eou__ How ? Do you want to play strip-trivia or something ? __eou__ Well , if you want to !

What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? __eou__ I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . __eou__ Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done . __eou__ You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . __eou__
I like your new skirt . __eou__ Do you think it fits me ? __eou__ Yes . It looks terrific ! __eou__ I bought it at half price . __eou__ You were lucky to find it . __eou__

A girlfriend is not everything . __eou__ But she means a lot to me . __eou__ Then forgive her mistake . __eou__
This small town has many serious problems . __eou__ What's the cause ? __eou__ The mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions . __eou__ I see why it lags behind other towns . __eou__

I---I ’ m proud of you . __eou__ Don ’ t cherish your words , dear . __eou__ I---I don ’ t feel like saying it . __eou__
You missed the film.That ' s a shame . __eou__ Is it stimulating ? __eou__ Yes . I got very excited . __eou__ I hope I still have chances . __eou__
Hello , this is the admissions office . Can I help you ? __eou__ Hi . I ’ m calling about your continuing education program . __eou__ What would you like to know ? __eou__ I want to become certified in computer programming . Do you offer any part-time courses for adult further education ? __eou__ Yes , we offer both night and weekend courses in a number of different subjects . __eou__ How do I sign up ? __eou__ If you give me your address , I can mail you an information packet and the application forms . __eou__ Great ! __eou__
How nice of you to come ! __eou__ It's been a long time , hasn't it ? How have you been ? __eou__ Just fine , thanks.And you ? __eou__ I've never been better , thanks . __eou__
Marquet , do you think I should enroll in the science course ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . If you want to graduated this year , you've got to take a science course . __eou__ Right , I figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses . __eou__ Well , I have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics . What you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors . __eou__ Yes , I'm really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school . __eou__ That's a problem . __eou__
Earning extra income on the Internet is easier than you might think . After I started selling traditional craft items on the Internet last year , I have really been able to make bank doing something I love . __eou__ Is that right ? I hear all these horror stories of internet business crashing because there is not enough of a customer base yet . How can you be sure your idea will cash in ? __eou__ To run a successful internet business , it requires a little research and relatively small investment . You've got to have a good idea of some kind of product that is in demand or would be popular . __eou__ That's marketing research ... But what about getting started once you have an idea ? __eou__ After you have your great idea , then you can set up shop by registering a domain name , creating a website , an email address , and a hosting service . If you want to go all out on your website , you can put together shopping cart technology , but that can be pricey to start out with . __eou__ Sounds like a lot of work ! __eou__ Anything worth doing takes work . Money doesn't grow on trees ... Most of us have to work for it . __eou__
You went out on a date last night , didn't you ? __eou__ Yes , I did , but Linda stood me up . She didn't keep the date for the first time . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ Why don't you phone her for a date again ? __eou__ I did phone her this morning , but she hung up on me . I think she is going to walk out on me . __eou__ Don't jump to conclusions . Look at the bright side , try to make another date again . __eou__ I will . Thanks for your advice . __eou__
Happy birthday , Aims ! __eou__ Thank you , Lisa . __eou__ Here is a present for you . I hope you like it . __eou__ Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time . __eou__ I'm very glad to hear that . __eou__ Come here ; let me introduce some friends to you . __eou__
Bill , do you know when did the Chinese begin to celebrate Teachers ' Day ? __eou__ I know the Chinese teachers had their first festival in 1985 . __eou__ So , it is the 27th Teachers ' Day . __eou__ What will you do on Teachers ' Day ? __eou__ I am going to send Mr . Li some flowers . What about you ? __eou__ I intend to invite him to dinner . __eou__
I hear scientists in the US have discovered a new AIDS vaccine . __eou__ Does it work ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . The report says it is better than the old vaccines . __eou__ Don ’ t count on it . I think the best way to prevent AIDS is to keep yourself clean by having clean sex and keeping a regular sex partner . __eou__ Right . That ’ s why doctor say AIDS prevention means cleanness . __eou__
Harry was angry last night . __eou__ That's because he's getting nervous . Anyway , this is the first time he's directed a play . __eou__ But he used to be very relaxed and cheerful . It's not like Harry to do a thing like that . __eou__ Yes , you're right . Maybe there's any other reason . __eou__
Did you get any pizza ? When I got there , only small one was left . What a pity ! __eou__ I got the short end of the stick . __eou__
Hello , Kevin . I hate to do this , but I have to cancel our appointment . __eou__ Oh , no ! Why ? I was looking forward to seeing you at my new place . __eou__ Yeah , I really wanted to come , too . But something unexpected in Shanghai have come up . I have to fly out for a few days , but I'll be back soon . __eou__ No problem . Call me when you get back . __eou__ I should have some free time next week . Say , next Wednesday evening ? __eou__ That's good for me , but do you think you'll be back by then ? I'd really like to see you . __eou__ Yeah , I'm expecting to come back on Tuesday . __eou__ Great ! That's settled then . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia . __eou__ Nice to meet you , Lvan.My name is Alike . I'm from Japan . __eou__ To me English is a difficult language . __eou__ A second language is always difficult . __eou__ True , but English is harder than most.It ' s a crazy language . __eou__ A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? __eou__ One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . __eou__ No wonder you say English is a crazy language . __eou__
May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ? __eou__ Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing ! __eou__ Why are they all in glass boxes ? __eou__ For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air . __eou__ So there isn't air in the glass boxes ? __eou__ No , there isn't . There is a vacuum in every box . __eou__ I wonder how old these things are . Thousands of years ? __eou__ Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time . __eou__ Hey , look at the tripod . I've seen it on TV . __eou__ It was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless ! __eou__
Honey come on ! We are going to be late ! Honestly , you take longer getting ready than I do ! __eou__ I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! Can you come here for a sec ? I need your help . __eou__ What is it ? Why are all these clothes on the bed ? __eou__ I don ’ t know what to wear ! Ok , give me your opinion . Do you like the way this looks ? The striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . I like the cut and hemline of these shorts so I think I ’ ll wear these as well . __eou__ Are you joking ? What am I going to do with you ? We are going to a dinner party not the beach ! Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and these corduroy pants . It ’ s chilly outside so you can wear this coat . __eou__ Thanks honey ! You have such great fashion sense.Now , what am I going to do with my hair ? __eou__
How may I help you ? __eou__ I need to return these books . __eou__ Give them here . __eou__ Here they are . __eou__ It appears these books are two weeks late . __eou__ I forgot they were due . __eou__ You do realize you are going to have to pay late fees , right ? __eou__ How much is the late fee ? __eou__ The late fee is 25 cents a day . __eou__ So I have to pay 25 cents for each day the books are late ? __eou__ It ’ s 25 cents for each book . __eou__ That ’ s a lot of money . __eou__
So what kind of music turns you on ? __eou__ Rock'n'Roll , I guess . __eou__ You mean the kind of stuff like Nirvana ? __eou__ Not really . That ’ s pretty heavy metal . __eou__
Hi , Robert . What happened to your face ? It looks swollen . __eou__ I had to go get a cavity filled today . __eou__ Did it hurt ? __eou__ I don't even wanna talk about it . It killed me ! __eou__ How long were you in the chair ? __eou__ It took quite a while , but the worst part was getting numbed . They had to give me 3 shoots . __eou__ Well , I guess you've learned a good lesson , huh . You have to take good care of your teeth . __eou__ No kidding . Not only can ’ t I stand the pain , but man ... dentists are expensive . The bill is going to be humungous ! __eou__ Don't you have a dental insurance ? __eou__ I do , but it still does not cover everything . __eou__
Merry Christmas ! __eou__ The same to you ! __eou__ Are you doing anything special ? __eou__ We're having some friends over.What are you doing ? __eou__ Oh . I'm just going to take it easy . __eou__
OK , guys . Here's the plan . Get the ball to the goal , and keep it away from Rich and Taylor ! __eou__ Why ? Are they good ? __eou__ They played ball at school . Here we go . Yi-jun , go out for a pass ! __eou__ I'm ready ! Whoa , what a hard throw ! I can't get that ! __eou__ Catch it , Yi-jun ! Run to the ball ! Uh-oh ! Slow down , you're going to hit ... __eou__ Ummmph ! __eou__
What are you doing ? __eou__ I ’ m just looking at this map of the world . I ’ m preparing for a geography class . __eou__ There are no countries marked on the map . __eou__ No , there aren ’ t . this map just show the geographical features . Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world . __eou__ The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water . Compared to the oceans , most countries are tiny . __eou__ I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall . __eou__ Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand canyon . __eou__ The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate . __eou__ It ’ s all so interesting . I ’ ll have to find more information about it on the internet . Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class . __eou__
What are you up to tonight , Steve ? __eou__ I'm going to a disco with my friends . __eou__ That sounds like fun . Have a good time . __eou__
Well , I can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance . __eou__ John , they are old-fashioned people from the Chinese countryside . That ’ s their custom . __eou__ I know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning . __eou__ Don ’ t your relatives visit other relatives ? __eou__ Yes , but Americans never visit without calling in advance , and they almost never stay overnight . __eou__ I think that maybe Chinese families are closer than your families . __eou__ I think you ’ re right ! __eou__
What is today ? __eou__ Thursday . __eou__ So the weekend is coming ! How about seeing a film ! __eou__ I'd love to . __eou__
Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! A __eou__ It does seem like the perfect day ! I ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up ca __eou__ There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect . __eou__ Ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee , a pail and a shovel . I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . Don ’ t stray too far . Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes __eou__ And stay in the shallow area . I don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier . __eou__ You ’ re back already ? The water was too cold , huh ? I ’ ll tell you a secret . Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ’ ll be warmer in there . Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some __eou__ What is that ? A jellyfish ? Jeremy , put that down right now ! It could sting you ! __eou__ Ah ! Not on me ! Ow ! __eou__
What do you think about studying in the U . S . ? __eou__ Well , for many international students , coming to the United States and living here and studying can be quite a daunting experience , especially when finding a house on campus or off campus . __eou__ Do you have any advice ? __eou__ I think first of all for first-time students , coming and living on campus in dormitories can provide a certain level of security . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ Uh , when you live off campus , there might be a certain amount of flexibility in choosing roommates that you might not have when living on campus . __eou__ I will think over your advice . __eou__ Well , of course , the choice is up to you . Good luck ! __eou__ I really appreciate your help . __eou__
Who is that guy ? __eou__ It's Clive of course . Where did you come from ? Every girl knows Clive ! __eou__ Really ? He is my type . __eou__ He is everybody's type . __eou__ What position does he play ? __eou__ Shooting guard . The same as Michael Jordan ! __eou__ Oh , I love Michael Jordan . He fills people's lives with great excitement . __eou__ Used to . But now he is too old to play in a fierce game like this . But Kobe is the upcoming superstar now . __eou__ Kobe is a good player but I heard he is a womanizer . __eou__ That is not true . They are just jealous of him ! __eou__ Jordan is a legend , anyway . An idol that no one can replace . I think Clive can make a good professional basketball player . He is not just about muscles he also plays smart . __eou__ You know what , he is also an outstanding football player . He is surely to be a star of tomorrow . __eou__ By the way , do you know if he has a girl friend ? __eou__ You are so not here ! His girlfriend is one of the cheer leaders . __eou__ Oh , My chance is slim then . __eou__
Here are the leads from last week's exhibit as a trade show . There are about forty or so that are hot . You should contact them immediately , in the next twenty-four hours if you can . The rest are categorized according to potential and interest.You can see we've got our hot stack , our warm stack , our lukewarm , and our cold but not dead stack . __eou__ Haha ... please don't tell me you've got a dead stack . I hate making cold calls ... __eou__ Don't worry , most of the leads on mildly interested , if not strongly interested . We've just got to make sure the Hot ones are contacted right away . And even the contacts that for what ever reason aren't prepared to make an order now , they might be interested in the future . Please be conscanciouss about getting a hold of everyone of these leads . We've spent a big chunk of marketing budget to find these people . I don't want our investment to go down the drain . __eou__ Don't worry , I've gotchy covered . __eou__
Where's your hometown ? __eou__ Shandong . __eou__
I just got laid off . The awful business , you know . __eou__ I ’ m very sorry to hear about that . So are you all right ? __eou__ Yeah , I ’ m better after talking to you . __eou__ Oh , you poor thing ! __eou__
What will you do now ? Propose to her . __eou__ Of course I won't chill out . Opportunity knocks only once . __eou__ You should strike while the iron is hot . __eou__ You're right . I will have a talk to her about that . __eou__
How do you usually get to school ? __eou__ I usually ride my bike . Which form of transport do you prefer to use ? __eou__ I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle , but when I feel lazy , I drive my car . __eou__ I think we should discourage people from using their private cars . They produce too much pollution ! __eou__ I agree , but I would find it difficult to stop using my car . It's just so convenient . __eou__ Cars might be convenient , but they're so bad for the environment . __eou__ Do you have a car ? __eou__ No . I used to have one though . Once I started using my bicycle to get around , I found that I didn't really need it . __eou__ Maybe if I sold my car now , I wouldn't be so tempted to use it . __eou__ You could try . It would save you a lot of money . __eou__ That's true . Every month , I spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs . __eou__ If you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too ! __eou__ I could stand to lose a few pounds . Having a car has made me lazy . I never end up walking anywhere ! __eou__ Let's go to a car dealership . I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price . __eou__ Sounds good ! Let's go ! __eou__
Bob is really handsome . __eou__ That's why he's very popular among girls . __eou__ I wish I were just as handsome . __eou__ You are ! __eou__
How's your new work , Carl ? __eou__ A tough job . They even offer in-service training every Wednesday afternoon . __eou__ Good for you . __eou__ I don't like it . I am not used to this kind of 9 to 5 work hours . Above all , I hate talking to those poker faces everyday . __eou__ Well , you have to take the bad with the good . __eou__ I guess so . I am badly off and I need this job . __eou__
What can I help you with today ? __eou__ When does the library close ? __eou__ The library closes at six o ’ clock . __eou__ Does it close at that time every day ? __eou__ Not always . __eou__ Is the library open on Saturdays ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ What time do you open and close on Saturday ? __eou__ The hours are from 9 am - 6 __eou__ Okay . Thank you very much . __eou__ Do you need anything else ? __eou__ No , that ’ s all . Thanks . __eou__
I can't wait until my car is repaired . The commuting with public transportation is killing me . __eou__ It can't be that bad . __eou__ But it is ! Take this morning for example . The subway was so packed this morning , I got totally squished by about a hundred busy commuters on the way to work . __eou__ At least the subway is better than the bus . It's faster for one thing . And usually less crowded . But the drawback is that the subway is more expensive than the bus . It adds up over time , if you take it every day . __eou__ That's true . The bus is even worse . Just thinking about taking the bus every day makes me tired ! Hey , how do you get to work every day ? __eou__ I ride my bike . I don't live too far away , so it's pretty convenient . it's only about a ten minute bike ride from my house to the office . __eou__ I'll bet it's good exercise , too ... a good way to keep fit . __eou__ Yes , not only a good way to keep in shape , but a good way to relieve stress as well . While you're stressed out by your commute , I'm releasing all the stress of the day with mine . __eou__
Why are you so rude to your wife ? __eou__ I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her . She's a chatter box . __eou__ But she means to help you , not to trouble you . __eou__ I know . But I just can't stand her butting in when I was trying to emphasize a point . __eou__
What he said disappointed me . __eou__ What did he say ? __eou__ He advised me to change to a more suitable course . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ He said that career in law was unsuitable for a women . __eou__ It is stupid to say so . __eou__
What do you think is harder , reading or writing ? __eou__ Well , they ’ re completely different . Reading is passive , and writing is active . __eou__ I don ’ t think I understand what you mean . Could you explain a little more ? __eou__ In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . In writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page . __eou__ Oh , now I see what you mean . When you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something ! __eou__ A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . Don ’ t you think so ? __eou__ I think I see what you mean . I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can ’ t write it . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__ So I have another question for you . What do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ? __eou__ They ’ re both harder than reading or writing . __eou__ In what way ? __eou__ Because they are direct communication with another person , and there ’ s a time limit . This time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of English . __eou__ You are making me feel really discouraged . __eou__ I ’ m not trying to discourage you . I ’ m trying to help you . You have to live with these difficulties . Isn ’ t it better to know about them ? The more you know about what you have to face , the better you ’ ll do . I promise ! __eou__
You look happy . __eou__ I am happy . I just bought a new car . __eou__ Wow ! Is it a good car ? __eou__ It ’ s a great car . It ’ s very comfortable and it goes really fast . __eou__ Was it expensive ? __eou__ Put it this way – it wasn ’ t cheap . __eou__ What colour is it ? __eou__ It ’ s red and black . __eou__
Let's meet tonight at the Thai restaurant at about 5 . __eou__ Fine , I'll take a taxi . __eou__ Why don't you walk ? It's only about 20 minutes walking and it's a nice evening . __eou__ Never thought about it , I sure you are right . It's quite a short walk . __eou__ Ha-ha , see you then . __eou__
Professor , do you have a few moments when I could meet with you ? __eou__ I schedule my appointments from two to four on Saturday ; what works best for you ? __eou__ Three would be a good time . __eou__ Great , do you need directions to my office ? __eou__ I'm not sure . __eou__ Well , just make sure to go through the double doors , and I'll be on the right . __eou__ OK , I'll find it . __eou__ It's very easy to find . __eou__ See you then . __eou__ I will enjoy seeing you ; have a good week ! __eou__
The boy threw up . __eou__ That's disgusting . __eou__
Bill . Bill ! You gotta help me ! __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? Slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack . __eou__ Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven ’ t bought my mom anything ! I ’ m such a bad son ! __eou__ Take it easy ! Let ’ s go to the mall , window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like . __eou__ That ’ s just it ! I don ’ t know what to get her ! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small ! I suck at getting presents for people . __eou__ That ’ s where you ’ re making a big mistake ! You can ’ t just guess peoples ’ likes or sizes ! Especially with clothes or jewelry . On top of that , I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her . At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like ! __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re right . When it comes down to it , I can be pretty tacky . __eou__ Yeah , tell me about it . I know ! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish , right ? Why don ’ t you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod . __eou__ Now that ’ s a great idea ! __eou__
Happy birthday , Ms . Lin . Here is a present for you . __eou__ Oh , thank you ! It's very kind of you . Ah , it is a porcelain vase . __eou__ I hope you like it . __eou__ Yes , it is lovely . I have been expecting something like this for a long time . Thanks ever so much . __eou__ I am glad you like it . __eou__
Cheer ! __eou__ Cheer ! __eou__ So what time tomorrow ? __eou__ Half past seven in the morning . __eou__ Where to meet ? __eou__ In the market . __eou__ OK . Bottoms up . __eou__ Bottoms up . __eou__ It's on me . __eou__ Thank you . This place is nice . __eou__
Wow , Is winter always this cold in Taiwan ? __eou__ Not really . It's much warmer usually . Your are not used to cold weather ? __eou__ No , I am from south California . This is my first real winter . __eou__ Well , You'd better get some more warm clothes . __eou__ What's the temperature today anyway ? __eou__ I would say it's about 5 degree Celsius . __eou__
Good evening , Mr.Brown . __eou__ Good evening , David.Good evening , Mary.It ' s so good of you both to come . __eou__ It's nice of you to invite us . __eou__
what are you listening to ? Is that Beethoven or Mozart ? __eou__ it's Beethoven . Do you like it ? __eou__ I think Beethoven's music is incredible . I've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too . Do you believe that ? __eou__ I don't know about that , but I do think that it helps people relax . __eou__ what other kind of music do you listen to ? __eou__ actually , I mostly just listen classical music . What about you ? __eou__ to be honest , I think classical music is too complicated for me . __eou__ what kind of music do you prefer then ? __eou__ I like pop music . Do you ? __eou__ not really . I don't think pop music has much depth . __eou__ I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much . __eou__ how long have you been in to pop music , then ? __eou__ I've always been into it . Have you always liked classical music ? __eou__ not really . When I was little , we didn't really listen to music at all . __eou__ so , how did you become interested in it ? __eou__ well , when I was about 10 years old , I started playing the piano . I think that's how it all started . __eou__ do you still play piano ? __eou__ yes , it's one of my hobbies . __eou__
Want to join me for a midnight snack ? I need to grab something to eat . __eou__ Fine with me , but no more chafing dish . __eou__ Let's go to the food stall . There's a good one just around the corner . __eou__ I'd love to try some snacks . __eou__ ( Later .. ) Everything looks tempting . What do you want to have ? __eou__ Kebabs and roast squid . __eou__ Can I have a bite ? __eou__ Help yourself . __eou__ Super ! __eou__
Can I help you , sir ? __eou__ Yes , I've been sitting here for a few minutes . I'm waiting for someone to put gas in my car . __eou__ I'm sorry , sir . But this is the self-service pump . __eou__ Self-service ? __eou__ Yes . You must fill up the car yourself . __eou__ Are you serious ? __eou__ Yes . Are you traveling here ? __eou__ Yes , I'm from Taiwan . I never heard of a gas station where you fill up your own car . __eou__ In America , most gas stations are like this . __eou__ Do I really have to do it ? I don't know how . __eou__ Well , since this is your first time , I will do it for you.But next time , if you want a full-service gas station , you should look at the sign . __eou__ What sign ? __eou__ Under the sign for the gas station , there will be a smaller sign that says Self-Serve or Full-Service.And some gas stations have both.But if they have both , some pumps will be self-serve and some will be full-serve.You have to look at the signs . __eou__ I see . __eou__
Oh , no . It looks like my computer really has caught a virus . __eou__ Why ? Did you open an attachment ? __eou__ Yes , something called “ George W . Bush . ” An hour later , all I see are pictures of George W . Bush in women's clothes . __eou__ I kind of like it . He looks better that way , doesn't he ? More presidential . __eou__ I preferred the forward with pictures of him side-by-side with monkeys . __eou__ Yeah , their expressions were exactly the same ! __eou__
John seems to be in high cotton . He may well become a big shot . __eou__ I bet my button dollar that he won't . He is no more than a nine day's wonder . __eou__ What is your idea ? __eou__ Many people like him get a flying start but soon disappear . __eou__
Millions of amateur investors like you , have to rely on a dizzying array of financial newspapers , magazines and commentators to get investment information . __eou__ Yes.It ' s sometimes scary if you think of the tremendous amount of media we face every day . __eou__ It's like information overload , not to mention the reliability of these papers and magazines . __eou__ Which financial magazines and newspapers do you think do the best job of checking facts ? __eou__ Well , for example , The Wall Street Journal is very , very good . Even though it's used on occasion ( as all news organizations are ) by Ces or bankers who leak their mergers in advance in order to get a positive spin . __eou__ I like to read Fortune . __eou__ Good . Fortune is usually ahead of the curve.And Business Week is very solid , too . __eou__ Where does a broadcast company get most of their information ? I hope it's not just from press releases . __eou__ A good broadcast company usually does far more than press releases.Their people go out and do real reporting , talking to people at the stock exchange , fund managers , analysts , etc . __eou__ But sometimes when a flimsy report , or even a rumor gets on television , there's going to be a terrible ' echo chamber ' effect . __eou__ You are right about that . __eou__
Hi , Li Ming . You look upset . What's the matter ? __eou__ There will be a parents ' meeting in our class this Saturday and I am worried about it . __eou__ Why ? We can leave school earlier that day . __eou__ I didn't do well in last exams . If my father knows it , he will beat me up . __eou__ I can't believe it . My parents never beat me . __eou__ You know that my father is irritable . __eou__ You can ask the teacher for help . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__
Did your company go union ? I heard that many companies in out industry are being unionized , so It's getting harder and harder to compete on a level playing field . __eou__ Yes , we're hopping on the bandwagon and signing up for the union . Mostly people are pretty happy about it ... I guess it depends on if you are in management or in the labor force . __eou__ Management isn't looking on the labor unions too favorably , I'd guess . I don't blame them ... labor unions can really put the squeeze on the executives . __eou__ Sure ... but it's probably better for the workers , because the union's whole purpose is to look out for the little guys . The only way that the little guys can take on the big bosses is if they unite . Labor unions are all about getting a voice for the underdog . __eou__
I hope the host team loses . __eou__ That all depends on how the visiting team shapes . __eou__ According to the papers , the visiting side is a strong team in America . __eou__ But two players of the team have been booked and one is out . __eou__
Hi honey ! You ’ ll never guess what ! My friends Julie and Alex are getting married ! __eou__ Wow that ’ s great news ! They ’ re a great couple ! __eou__ I know ! Anyways I just talked to Alex ’ s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party It ’ s gonna be so much fun ! All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night . __eou__ You aren ’ t going to a strip club , are you ? I don ’ t want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it ’ s your friends party . __eou__ Aw come on ! It ’ s just some innocent fun ! You know how these things are ! We are gonna play drinking games , get him some gag gifts and just have a good time . Nothing too over the top . __eou__ Well , I don ’ t know . __eou__ Come on ! If one of your friends was getting married I wouldn ’ t mind you going to her bachelorette party ! __eou__ Good , because my friend Wendy is getting married and I ’ m organizing her party ! __eou__
Aren ’ t you interested in watching the Olympics ? There have been some excellent performances by athletes from all over the world . __eou__ I just don ’ t find it very interesting . __eou__ I think it ’ s wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event . __eou__ I think that for a lot of people , it ’ s just a way to try and show their country is better than other countries . __eou__ I think the Olympics help to promote world peace . __eou__ I ’ m not sure about that . We still have many wars in the world . I think that the idea behind the Olympics is a good one , but the reality is that during the Olympics countries compete . There ’ s no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other . __eou__ You are so pessimistic ! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed , skill , agility and strength . Most people hope to see someone from their country win , but I think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete . __eou__ Well . I think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the Paralympics . __eou__ Now there we are in agreement ! __eou__
You have a lovely house , Jack . __eou__ Thank you . But a number of things have been going wrong lately . __eou__ That's too bad . What problems are you having . __eou__ Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over . __eou__ I ’ Ve studied home decoration as a hobby . Could I make some suggestions ? __eou__ Go right ahead . __eou__ Well , I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . Also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room __eou__ Well , you really do have a talent for this , Alice . Thanks for the suggestions . __eou__ You are welcome , Jack . Glad to be of help . __eou__
What are you hiding in your coat pocket ? __eou__ It's a camera . __eou__ You want to take pictures of the inside of your pocket ? __eou__ Not even funny , Billy . This is my new snapshot sticker camera . __eou__ What's that supposed to mean ? __eou__ Well , there are adhesive strips on the backs . You can stick them anywhere . __eou__
Sorry.What was that you said ? __eou__ I'll meet you at the Gate round about seven . __eou__ Where ? __eou__ At the Gate . __eou__ When , did you say ? __eou__ Round about seven . __eou__ Who's coming ? __eou__ Peter.Peter Brown , you know.Don ' t forget to bring the letter . __eou__ Sorry . I didn't quite catch what you said.There ' s a lot of noise outside . __eou__ I told you not to forget to bring the letter . __eou__ Loretta ? No , she can't come , she's busy . __eou__
I broke my sister's mirror . I'm sure it'll get her back up . I really don't know how I can escape the punishment . __eou__ You'd better tell your sister what happened and face the music . __eou__
My accountant thinks she can save me lots of money on my taxes this year . __eou__ That sounds great ! __eou__
How's it going ? __eou__ I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ? __eou__ To be honest , I'm a bit fed up . __eou__ What's wrong ? __eou__ There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around . __eou__ I see ! Do you want to ask her out ? __eou__ Sure , but how ? __eou__ You can ask her out for drinks after work . __eou__ But for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am . __eou__ Then you've got a lot of work to do . You need to get her to notice you first . __eou__ Easier said than done . __eou__ You can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying ' hello ' to her . __eou__ But I always get tongue-tied when I see her . __eou__ That's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most girls prefer being chased . __eou__ I see . I'll try . __eou__ Good luck ! __eou__
Excuse me . May I come in ? __eou__ Sure . Come on in . __eou__
i saw lily for the first time . and fell like i'v been struck by lightening.she is a girl of my dreams . i have a date with her on Friday , but i really can't decide what to do . __eou__ what about taking her for a dinner or a movie ? __eou__ not bad , any other ideas ? __eou__ well , there is a play on campus this weekend . __eou__ good idea . that ' s why i think i have culture . you have any other suggestions ? __eou__ what's the matter with these ideas ? __eou__ They are good , but i still need a few more . __eou__ what about going on a picnic ? __eou__ Cool , but what if the weather is not ideal ? __eou__ you can also take her to the art museum or a cafe .

Where did you stay ? __eou__ Some friends of my parents live out there , and they invited me there . __eou__ So , what did you do out there ? I mean besides bask in the sun , obviously . __eou__ I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball . You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand . I couldn ’ t get through a whole game before I had to sit down . __eou__ Not to mention cooler . Did you go swimming ? __eou__ I wanted to , but the water is too cold , and I just wetted in up to my knees . __eou__ It all sounds so relaxing . I wish I could get away to the beach like that . __eou__ It looks like you could use it . Don ’ t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again . __eou__

It is very windy on the lake . __eou__ Then we can take a walk and enjoy the scenery in the park . __eou__

Now he ’ s hanging some strong strings on the nails . __eou__ And what ’ s Mrs . King doing ? __eou__ She ’ s bringing something pink for Mr . King to drink . Now she ’ s putting it ... OK . __eou__ What ’ s happening ? __eou__ The ladder ’ s falling ? __eou__ What ’ s Mr . King doing ? __eou__ He ’ s hanging from the string . He ’ s holding onto the string with his fingers and shouting to Mrs . King . __eou__ And is she helping him ? __eou__ No , she ’ s running toward our house . That ’ s her ringing the bell . __eou__ Well , I ’ m not going to answer it . I ’ m sleeping . __eou__

I don ’ t like many of his movies , actually . __eou__ It ’ s a thriller . It has Julia Roberts playing the female lead . __eou__ I like thrillers and I like Julia Roberts , so it might be interesting . I read a review today and the critic didn ’ t seem to be very impressed . __eou__ What did the critic say ? __eou__ He didn ’ t say it was bad , but he said that it wasn ’ t as good as it could have been , particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it . __eou__ The movie starts at eight o ’ clock , so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready . __eou__ Good . Dinner is nearly ready and I ’ d like to watch the news before we go . The Oscars were last night and I want to see the results . __eou__ I won ’ t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . There were a few surprises . __eou__
this is tough to say , Jordan , but I think we should break up . __eou__ are you serious ? __eou__ yes , I mean it . __eou__ but why ? Did I do anything wrong ? __eou__ no , we are just too different . This isn ’ t working . __eou__ hey , come on . It ’ s too early to say that .

What kind of prizes ? __eou__ Well , I heard that last year Vivian from accounting won a new car ! __eou__ A new car ! You're kidding ! __eou__ No , really ! And she told me the secret to winning , wear red underwear ! __eou__ Wear red underwear ? ! Does that really work ? Are you going to try it ? __eou__ Of course !

Have you ever witnessed any crimes or accidents ? __eou__ I don't quite remember .

All the routine work really browns me off . __eou__ Oh , come on.You ' Ve just started . __eou__ I wish I hadn't chosen this job . __eou__
Yuck . The carrots taste awful and salty . Hi sis , how do you like them ? __eou__ I like them very much . They are delicious . __eou__ Well , you can have all my carrots . __eou__ Daniel , hold on for a minute . What are you trying to pull there ? __eou__ Nothing .

It's about time for some dessert . __eou__ Oh , you want my chocolate cakes , so to speak ! __eou__ No , no , I'm just thinking of some dessert .

Hey . I'm a visitor from China . I love your music . It's the best I've ever heard . Will you please spare a little bit of time for me ? __eou__ Sure . Thank you for saying that . Actually , those songs were sung for the first time today . I wrote them in the past two months . __eou__ Oh , you wrote them all by yourself . That's amazing ! Are you a regular singer here ? __eou__ You can say that . But my band and I also sing regularly in several other places , too . __eou__ Cool . Your guitar skills are very impressive . How did you learn to play like that ? __eou__ I picked up guitar at an early age , maybe around 8 years old . Afterward , I taught myself by listening to some records of top players . __eou__ Wow , that's unbelievable ! You play so well , but you've never been to a real teacher . You will definitely be famous in the near future . __eou__
Could you come and spend the weekend with us ? __eou__ Oh , I'm afraid I can't . I've had a date already . __eou__ That's too bad ! __eou__ Maybe some other time . __eou__
Excuse me . I don't think we have met before . My name is Mary Jenson . __eou__ Oh , hello . I'm Bias Chettri . __eou__ Good to meet you , Mr Chettri . __eou__ Pleased to meet you too , Ms Jenson . __eou__

I wonder see Dean Mr . Lee first . I was wondering if could you tell me where his office is ? __eou__ Certainly . Mr .

It ’ s very kind of you . __eou__ My pleasure . __eou__ This is it ? __eou__ It ’ s up on the second floor . You have to use the stairs . The elevator isn ’ t working . __eou__
Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at . __eou__ Listen , Nancy . If I don't work hard , I will be laid off . __eou__ You are passing the buck . I'll be hanged if I ask you to go to the park with us . __eou__ Come on , Nancy . Play it cool . I go with you and burn the middle night oil tonight . __eou__
Hi , Mr . Zhang . What ’ s wrong ? You don ’ t look so happy . How was your date ? __eou__ I was turned down again . It ’ s frustrating . I guess you ’ Ve got to teach me some skills . __eou__ Me ? I ’ m even less experienced than you are . __eou__ At least you know what American women generally like in a man . __eou__ Believe it or not , I guess American women like a man in good shape , which Chinese women may not care about so much . That ’ s my honest opinion . I know you have been trying very hard . __eou__ American men are naturally taller than Chinese men . So even if I exercise , there aren ’ t many chances . __eou__ No , that ’ s not true . I ’ Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese . But those Chinese look very strong and healthy . So if you exercise more often , I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls . How old is Jacky Chan ? He ’ s small and short . But I bet he can have any American woman he wants . __eou__ You know , that ’ s going to be a tremendous change for me . Because I never exercise . __eou__ Why don ’ t you try then ? Even if it doesn ’ t help you find an American girl , you could still have a stronger and healthier body . You won ’ t lose anything by doing that . __eou__
Have you heard that new song by the Beastie Boys ? __eou__ Why do you listen to rap ? __eou__ It's not much different from that heavy metal music you like so much . __eou__ Heavy metal music is a lot different from rap music.You can dance to heavy metal . __eou__ Hey , you can dance to rap music ! __eou__ I can't dance to it . And I know you can't either . Because I've seen you try . __eou__
What's your new girlfriend like ? __eou__ Katherine ? Well , she's good at languages . __eou__ Does she know how to speak Spanish ? __eou__ She knows how to speak Spanish and Japanese . __eou__ Wow ! ! ! __eou__ And she's good at sports , too . She knows how to play tennis and basketball . __eou__ That's terrific ! __eou__ But there's one thing she's not good at . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ She's not good at remembering things . We have a date , and she's an hour late ! ! __eou__
Are these your text books ? Biochemistry , General Ecology , Botany , Cell Genetics , Molecular Genetics ... __eou__ Yes . I gotta review all of them for the final exam . It is just around the corner . __eou__ Oh , right ! Do you have many exams at the end of each semester ? __eou__ That depends . Some semesters have many , some don't . And some courses don't have exams but only ask for papers . That's easy . __eou__ And when do you prepare for your final exam ? __eou__ Honestly speaking , most students prepare it one month before the exam . __eou__ Really ? You only review your lessons in one month ? Does it work ? __eou__ Of course , it's useful . And it's very crucial to have the copies of teacher's notes , because most questions in the exam are based on them . __eou__ Wow , and all the key points are included in them ? You're so smart ! __eou__ But the exam is not as simple as you may imagine . We have to stay up late . __eou__ Do you have the classrooms open for the whole night ? __eou__ Yes , some people even pack up his bed quilt and sleep there . That's a little bit crazy . __eou__
What's today's date ? __eou__ It's January . __eou__
You know , Mary , I feel we meet somewhere before . Where were you born ? __eou__ I was born in Beijing , but I spent most of my childhood in London . __eou__ What was your childhood like ? __eou__ I had a pretty strict upbringing , and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me . __eou__ Where did you go to university ? __eou__ My parents wanted me to stay in Beijing , but I decided to go back to England . I graduated from University of Newcastle upon Tyne with a degree in Cross Culture Communication . __eou__ What is your current occupation ? __eou__ I am a journalist . I write for China Daily . __eou__ Did you know that you wanted to be a journalist right after your graduation ? __eou__ No , I didn ’ t . I started working at a university in London but as time went by , I found I did not really like my job . I decided to explore other fields . Journalism is great fit for me as well as a challenge . __eou__ Do you like your current job ? __eou__ Yes , I came to Beijing two years ago looking for new opportunities . I was lucky because my friend introduced me to my current company . __eou__
Do you want a cigarette ? __eou__ No , thank you . I've given up , you know . __eou__ You don't mind if I have one . __eou__ Well , all tight . But you know , smoking does do harm to your health . __eou__ Yes , you are right . __eou__ Why don't you try and give it up ? __eou__ I've tried to give up smoking several times , but it's no use . __eou__
Hey , Jordan , is that you ? Long time no see ! __eou__ Oh , hey , no kidding ! I haven't seen you since orientation three months ago ! So how've you been ? Settling into college life OK ? __eou__ Yeah , I think so ! I pledged Phi Iota Alpha , so I'm living at the frat house now . __eou__ Oh , so you're a frat boy now , huh ? __eou__ Yeah , yeah , I know , it's totally cliche , but really , I think it's been a good decision . I've got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys . What about you ? What have you been up to ? __eou__ Not much . I'm still living at home and commuting to school . I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about . It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped . The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count . __eou__ That sounds smart ... but kind of boring . __eou__ Yeah , it is , a little bit . I joined the Great Outdoors Club , though , which has been a lot of fun . We've gone on two camping trips already , and I've made some good friends . __eou__ That's cool . Hey , so have you decided on your major yet ? __eou__ Definitely pre-med . What about you ? __eou__ I still have no clue ... but we don't have to declare a major till our sophomore year , so I've got time ! Oops , I'm late for class . Gotta run ! __eou__ OK , take care ! Hey , nice running into you ! __eou__ Yeah , you too ! __eou__
Whatever we do , we should do it above board . __eou__ You are right . We shouldn't do anything under the table . __eou__ Well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about it through other channels . __eou__
How did you get into hip hop ? __eou__ Well , all my friends listen to it , so I became a big fan too . __eou__ Who is your favorite hip hop artist ? __eou__ I'm a big fan of Snoop Dog . __eou__
It ’ s over . __eou__ What is over ? __eou__ Our relationship . I mean my friend and I ... __eou__ Any reasons ? __eou__ The cause is another boy . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s too bad . __eou__
How did you do on your BELTS exam ? __eou__ Fantastic ! I got an overall score of eight . __eou__ That's excellent ! Have you received your conditional offers yet ? __eou__ Yes .

We ’ Ve been over this a thousand times . The data is irrefutable ! Look , we ’ Ve done extensive research , built studies , and read the literature , and there is conclusive evidence to support my theory ! __eou__ Horowitz , I beg to differ . Even in your most recent study , the investigative approach was flawed ! You know as well as I do that the collection of data was not systematic , and there is a large margin of error . To draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be misleading __eou__ That is preposterous ! __eou__ You are trying to single-handedly solve one of the world ’ s greatest mysteries , and yet you are oblivious to the fact that you are wrong ! __eou__ I am not wrong ! The chicken came first ! __eou__ No ! The egg came first ! __eou__
My husband goes out drinking with his friends every night . I'm fed up with it . __eou__ Maybe you two should go see a marriage counselor . __eou__
Charles , have you finished your homework ? __eou__ Not yet , Grandma , What's the matter ? __eou__ I want you to have a walk with me . __eou__ I'll finish soon . __eou__
Did you lock the doors ? __eou__ All except the back door . I left that open for Tim . He took the dog for a walk . __eou__ Well , I ’ m going on to bed . I ’ m beat . __eou__ Ok , I ’ m going to stay up awhile . I ’ Ve got to go over the household budget , We ‘ re a little over-spend this month . __eou__ Please told Tim to close the door to the basement . I don ’ t want dog down there tonight . __eou__ Ok , Good night , see you at breakfast . __eou__
Have you ever played Making ? __eou__ Not really , but I know it is very popular a traditional Chinese gambling game . __eou__ Yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . I tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . So I went to watch people play yesterday only to find I was even more confused . I think I have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . Practice makes the master . __eou__ Typical Francis , whether you are at work , or engaged in leisure time activities , you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself . __eou__ It is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active . __eou__
My German teacher thought it would be a good idea to have German pen friends to write to in German . __eou__ What a great idea ! Now you have a friendly audience to practice with ! __eou__ The only thing is that my pen friend will be writing in English . __eou__ Oh , he wants to practice his language skills , too . __eou__ That's right . And it's a B that I'll be writing too . Her name is Olga . __eou__ Maybe Olga can introduce you to some of her friends who can write to you in German and you can do the same for her with your friends to write her in English . __eou__ That's a great idea ! Why didn't I think of that ? __eou__ I don't know , but you know how to surround yourself with great friends ! __eou__
I just had a terrible week . __eou__ What a shame ! __eou__ I fell down and hurt my arm . __eou__ That's too bad . __eou__ Then my son drove into a tree __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . __eou__ The dog bit the delivery boy . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ And a storm blew our roof away . __eou__ Ho , no ! __eou__
Hi , Jenny . You look like you are in a hurry to somewhere . Where are you going ? __eou__ I am going to the bank . I need to cash some checks . __eou__ That's great . We can go to the bank together . __eou__ Why are you going there ? __eou__ I will go to Japan on business for 5 days next Tuesday . I want to exchange some Japanese yen . __eou__ I see . Will you bring a lot of money with you ? __eou__ Not really . I plan to bring some cash and withdraw money at the ATM in Japan . __eou__ Do you have the bank card in Japan ? __eou__ Nope . You can use the credit card to withdraw the money in foreign countries . __eou__ That sounds really convenient . Do you pay extra money to enjoy this service ? __eou__ No . It is free of charge . __eou__ Great ! I will apply for a credit card when I go to the bank later . __eou__ I think we are running out of time . The bank is going to close soon . __eou__

It depends on where you are and what position you are in . For instance , if you are in an elevator and you smile , you will make other takers uncomfortable . __eou__ That ’ s an exception . But I am fed up with those who keep a straight face in front of me . __eou__ I cannot see eye to eye with you here . You see , I am fed up with those who keep smiling to me . I mean , they smile for no reason at all . __eou__ That means you don ’ t like them . If you hit it off with them , you will like to see their smiles . __eou__
It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah.The autumn is marvelous here . __eou__ How about winter ? __eou__ That's a hard time.The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy . __eou__ It's boring , right ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Do you get much rain during the summer ? __eou__ Plenty.We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area . __eou__ So you should bring an umbrella often . __eou__ That's right . __eou__
I ’ m betting the New York Yankees win . How about you ? __eou__ Well , I ’ m favor of the Red Sox . They ’ Ve had a good season . __eou__ Sorry , guys . Could I just interrupt for a moment ? My money is on the Yankees ! __eou__ That ’ s not a very good pick . I ’ m against the Yankees . __eou__ Hey , Ken . Good luck if you already put your money on the Red Sox . __eou__ Yeah , I ’ m with you on that . __eou__
When in Rome , do as the Romans do , they say . __eou__ What do the Romans do ? __eou__ They live in Rome , of course , and go to work by car or bus . But sometimes it takes too long that way because of the traffic jams , so they walk . __eou__ In other words , the Romans do what everyone else does . __eou__ Yes , but they do it differently . Everything is different . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , the climate's different for a start . It doesn't rain so much as it does in England . The sun shines more often . __eou__ I envy them the sun . __eou__ I know . You hate the rain , don't you ? __eou__ I certainly do . __eou__ And a Roman really Ioves life . Eye knows how to enjoy himself . __eou__ They always eat spaghetti and drink wine , don't they ? __eou__ Not always . But they like a good meal .

So , are you enjoying the performance so far ? __eou__ Well , the costumes and the set are marvellous , but the acting is a bit stiff . What do you think ? __eou__ I think you're being a little critical . The actor in the lead role is fantastic . I suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though . __eou__ Do you know anyone in the play ? __eou__ Actually , the woman playing Ophelia is a past classmate of mine . __eou__ Really ? Is that why you wanted to come to the play ? __eou__ That's only part of it . I absolutely adore this director . Every play he works on turns out great . __eou__ So you've seen other plays that he's directed ? __eou__ Quite a few actually . By the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . My friend has invited us . Do you want to go ? __eou__ Sure , I'd love to meet the cast !

Maybe I'll just be a cheerleader . __eou__ C'mon , Yi-jun . It's lots of fun . You've seen football played on TV . __eou__ Uh , yeah . And I've seen guys in pads tackled . We have no pads . I don't want to be tackled . __eou__ There's barely any contact in touch football . People just tag you to stop the play . __eou__ OK , but they better tag lightly ! __eou__
Hi , Cindy . I thought I ’ d missed you . __eou__ Oh , I am very sorry , Hans . Thank you for waiting for me . You must have been here a long time already . __eou__ It ’ s all right . __eou__ I was caught in the heavy rain , or I would have come earlier .

I am trying to decide what school to apply to ? __eou__ Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ? __eou__ I am not sure . What's the difference between them ? __eou__ Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere . __eou__ Which is better ? __eou__ One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers . __eou__ I hear you have to wear uniforms at private school . __eou__ Yes , sometimes . __eou__

You can't do so many things at the same time . What exactly do you want ? __eou__ I don't know . Do you have any advice for me ? __eou__ yeah , you should first decide what kind of career you really want , plan your career path , and then try your best to achieve your goal . __eou__ I think perhaps I need to buy a few years while I figure out about my career . __eou__ no , you can't waste your time wandering around . If you want a job that requires a higher degree or diploma , you should focus on your graduate school entrance exam ; if you want a job that needs working __eou__ thank you so much for your advice .

Look at these clothes designed by top fashion designer like Versacci , Calvin Klein , and Vivienne Westwood . What do you think of them ? __eou__ Well , they look lovely , but they ’ re not very practical . I mean , would you wear that dress to the office or walking down the street ? __eou__ I know what you mean . People would stare at you in amazement if you wore something like that in an everyday situation . I suppose only extravagant rich people wear them at cocktail parties . __eou__ Maybe . I ’ m not sure why they have fashion shows like this . Hardly anyone will buy those clothes . The clothes you see are nothing like the ones that ordinary people wear . It seems like a waste of money . __eou__ I think that the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons . First , it ’ s just like a big party . They can meet each other and network . The other thing is that it is great advertising . All the journalists and photographers are there . Thirdly , it give them a chance to show what they would like to see people wearing . __eou__ You meant it ’ s an expression of their fantasies ? __eou__ Yes . I think the designers are saying that these clothes are what they would like to see people wear if those people weren ’ t concerned with what other people might think . In a way , the designers are saying ‘ don ’ t worry about what others think . Wear what you like ! ’ . __eou__ Very philosophical . I think they design these clothes more for publicity . They try to see who can be the most extreme and outrageous , but still stylish . __eou__ Come on . All this fashion has reminded me that I want to buy some clothes . __eou__
David , I ’ m going to China . __eou__ Really ? How do you get the chance ? __eou__ You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward .

China is such a beautiful country . __eou__ I ’ m sure I will . __eou__ Have a nice journey , Lily . __eou__ Thank you , David . __eou__
Dora , are you interested in going to the museum with me tomorrow ? I read the newspaper this morning . I know there is an art exhibition in Taipei Modern Art Museum . __eou__ Sure . I am free tomorrow . It sounds interesting to me . Can we buy the ticket online ? __eou__ I don't think so . I think we had better go there earlier , or we may have to spend a lot of time waiting . __eou__ I guess that is the thing we can do with we really want to visit the museum . __eou__ Look at the ticket booth in the center . There seems to be not as many people as we thought it would be . __eou__ Yeah . We are lucky . Let's go buy the tickets first . We can have breakfast later . I am so hungry . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__ ( After the breakfast ) Which floor is the art exhibition we are going to ? __eou__ I have no idea . Let me take a closer look at my museum map __eou__ Sure , take your time . We have a whole day . __eou__ It's on the 2nd floor . We are going to see some beautiful paintings about the history of ancient Greece . __eou__ Look at the museum guide.It says there are also some sculptures and potteries in this area . Let's rent an audio guide . __eou__

It's quite warm now . __eou__ Where do you live ? __eou__ In London.Where do you live ? __eou__ Here.Near this school . __eou__
I've been looking forward to the new semester . __eou__ I hope we can make great progress in this new semester . __eou__ Hope so . __eou__ I hear we'll have a new English teacher this semester . __eou__ Really ? I hope we will do much better under her guidance . __eou__ I am sure we will . __eou__
Post office offer lots of services nowadays , don ’ t they ? Years age , you only really used the post office to send mail , save money , and send or collect money . __eou__ Nowadays , they offer so many services , you hardly know which one to choose . Take mailing for example . Do you send something first class or second class or do you use EMS ? __eou__ I save money in a post office saving account . There used to be just one kind of account , but now there are several . They each have different conditions and interest rates . __eou__ You can buy things at post office that were never sold there before . You can buy sweets and chocolates , newspapers , birthday and Christmas cards ... __eou__ Post offices are still the place to go to collect welfare benefits , like unemployment benefit and child support benefit . The queue are very long on the days when people collect those payment . __eou__ My son likes going to the main post office . They have a philately counter where he can buy stamps for his collection . __eou__ Do you think that the service at post offices has improved ? __eou__ I think it ’ s better for some things , like sending and receiving money , but if you need to post something it sometimes takes longer than it used to . __eou__ I like being able to buy newspapers and magazines at the post office . It means that I don ’ t need to go to two places __eou__
She is really pretty , isn't she ? Her skin looks so baby-smooth ! __eou__ Well , it's just that she put a lot of makeup on her face . Actually , natural beauty comes from within . __eou__ Ah , I can smell jealousy in the air . __eou__ She has nothing that deserves my jealousy . I don't have to put things on my face and I still look pretty . Don't you think so ? __eou__ Yeah , right . But what did you put on your face last night ? Those little greenish things . __eou__ They are cucumbers . They are natural skin soothers , natural healers of the skin.Haven ' t you heard them say on TV that ... eh ... they soften the skin , wipe out the roughness , counter irritation and build strength and resilience ? __eou__ Yeah , yeah , yeah ! They wipe out tight , tired feelings and remove lines and age signs . Blah , blah ... See , I can even recite it . __eou__ That's right . You have learned a lot , haven't you ? __eou__
It sounds that you have a high opinion of him . __eou__ He is an all-right guy . I have no bone to pick with him . __eou__ Birds of feather flock together . __eou__ But he is not a fine wether friend who could sell you down the river . __eou__ You cannot judge a person that way . I have a hunch that he is a sly dog . __eou__ Depends on with whom . He may be doing things on the sly , but he is honest with me . I trust him . __eou__ You can never tell . He might do you in when he sees an angle in doing it . __eou__
Welcome ! Welcome to Little Italy . We're the most Italian family here ! __eou__ So I've heard . That's why I'm having such a great time . __eou__ If I hadn't married an Italian man , I probably wouldn't be pregnant so often . And maybe I could raise pigs instead of bambinos ! __eou__ Huh ? Um ... well , it's nice to see that some people still have big families . __eou__ It is nice , but it would be nicer if my macho husband would get off his tush and help me . Ha-ha ... Have this . It's from Italy ! __eou__
What was that noise ? __eou__ It was the pilot putting the wheels down.We must be coming into land.Are you frightened ? __eou__ Frightened ? You must be joking ! __eou__
Two people were robbed last night near the park . __eou__ Again ? The area around the park is too dark at night . There should be more lights there . __eou__ I am afraid of the dark . I don ’ t feel safe in the dark . I feel someone is hiding in the dark to attack me . __eou__ Your feelings might be right . You should never walk alone there at night . It is too dangerous . __eou__ I Know . And you should be more careful , too . __eou__
Well , that's it . 7 appointments in Paris at beginning of next week , and 4 in Frankfurt at the end of the week . __eou__ It's certainly a tight schedule . __eou__ Now it's a question of getting there . I need a flight to Paris on Sunday evening and a hotel in Paris for 3 nights . I have to be in Frankfurt by 11 on Thursday morning . And I will need a hotel for one night . I will head home on Friday . __eou__ At what time ? __eou__ My last appointment is at 3 , so I should be free by 5 at the very latest . I think I could get to the airport by 6 . __eou__ Do you know how far you will be from the airport at 5 ? __eou__ No , not really . __eou__ So you are not sure how long it will take to get there ? __eou__ No , but I am sure it won't take more than an hour . __eou__ Don't forget it's Friday nighty . If Frankfurt's anything like London , everybody will be leaving for the weekend . It will be a rush hour and traffic might be moving very slowly . __eou__ You are a pessimist . __eou__ I am a realist . __eou__

Do you usually park in the daytime or the evening ? __eou__ I park days and evenings . __eou__ Be careful about the time limits on the streets . Have you seen the signs for time limits ? __eou__ What signs ? __eou__ As long as you are careful reading the signs , you will always know how long you can park and what days are OK to park there . Are you aware of the curb colors ? __eou__ What curb colors ? __eou__ If you can remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means that you can only load and unload , you are going to be OK . __eou__

Let's go . __eou__ shouldn't we make an appointment first ? __eou__ we would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse . __eou__ whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting ! __eou__

So , how's your work ? __eou__ Good . How about you ? __eou__ I am going to resign . A few of the new staff have already left . Obviously , a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries . __eou__ But your company is huge .

what kind of music do you like listening to ? __eou__ I like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . You know , I go to a disco almost every week . Sometimes it ’ s too loud though . You prefer classical music , don ’ t you ? __eou__ yes , I do . I find it very relaxing . I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work . __eou__ I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music . __eou__ classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better . __eou__ really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress . __eou__ yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework . __eou__ I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brain power . __eou__ you can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier . __eou__ that ’ s true . There ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character . __eou__

Do you think I still fashionable in this dress ? __eou__ I think so . Blue is still very fashionable at the moment . __eou__ This style came out last year , though . I like the dress , but I ’ m not sure whether last year ’ s fashions will be same this year . __eou__ I think this kind of dress will stay in fashion for a few more years . People don ’ t change fashions every year . It would be too expensive . __eou__ Yes . Only the top designer try to tell people to change fashion every year , but only rich people can do it . __eou__ There are some real fashion victims who just have to keep totally up-to-date with expensive clothes . __eou__ I wish I could be one of those people , but my budget simply doesn ’ t stretch that far . I have to limit the amount of money I spend on clothes otherwise I would go on a shopping frenzy . __eou__ I know what you mean . The situation will be worse if we marry our boyfriends and have children . The we ’ ll have even less money to spend on fashionable clothes ! __eou__

Oh ... I am really worried about the exam . I have no idea what will be on it . __eou__ Why ? Just read your notes.You can see what the professor stressed in the lectures.Probably the exam will ask about things he stressed . __eou__ Yes , but my notes are all nonsense . I can't figure out what is important . __eou__ Let me see them.Are these all the notes you have ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ But Laurie , how can you do well in school if you don't take more notes ? __eou__ What do you mean ? You think I don't write enough . __eou__ I'm sure you don't write enough.Look at this . Here you wrote , Russian Revolution . 1917 . Bolsheviks . Real revolution , or coup ? And that's all ? I remember he lectured for a half hour about that question.And you didn't write any of it ! __eou__ I know , but I listened . __eou__ Yes , but did you remember ? You need good notes to help you remember . __eou__ I suppose you're right . But what can I do ? I don't know what to write down . __eou__ There are different things you can do.For one , the university offers a special free course on note-taking.You should go to the course . Also , I am pretty good at taking notes . I can help you on this exam . I will photocopy all my notes , and you can compare them to your notes.Then maybe you will see what kinds of things to write down . __eou__ That would really help me , Sue . I appreciate it . All this makes me feel like an idiot . __eou__ Don't feel that way . I know you are very smart.Note - taking is a special skill . All students need to learn it.Some people are very smart , but they just haven't learned how to take notes yet . I'm lucky because I had a good English teacher in high school.She taught me how to take good notes . It's not hard . __eou__ Alright . University and high school seem very different to me . I suppose I just need to learn how to manage lecture classes . Then I will do better . __eou__
What are you grinning about ? __eou__ Stephany said she would go out with me . __eou__ I thought mom said no dating till you are 16 . __eou__ That ’ s in one month , and besides , this is a group date with all of our friends . __eou__ All of your friends , what are you planning to do ? __eou__ We ’ re going fishing . __eou__ What a party ! I hope you don ’ t expect the girls to fish . __eou__ These girls are different , they are not wimpy . __eou__

For example just this morning I was feeling detached and lonely , even though there was really no reason to feel that way . __eou__ Well , maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident , brave and hopeful ! __eou__ I hope you are right . __eou__

Bosses watching and testing me all the time , not liking in college , handed in paper months later and tested on schedule . It is so busy .

Professor Wang looks so handsome today . He is wearing a light brown suit and a pink tie . __eou__ He always wears an extremely becoming suit with tie . __eou__ He ’ s quite particular about what he wears , especially about his ties . He gets different tie each day . __eou__ A light brown suit and a pink tie today , and a light blue shirt and a blue tie yesterday . A perfect match ! __eou__ The tie is necessary for man . It makes you look so attractive in a super tie . __eou__ Match is important ; well , the way of tying is also important . __eou__ My father dose not know how to tie a tie , for he often wears a cravat . __eou__ My father wears a tie every day , but he can ’ t do it himself . My mother helps him with his tie every morning . __eou__ You mother is not only a patient mother but also a gentle wife . __eou__
There is a tornado warning on . My mother just told me she heard it on the radio . __eou__ What is a tornado warning ? __eou__ It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area . __eou__ Really ? In New Berlin ? __eou__ No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a " tornado watch . " That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado . __eou__ I understand . They think a tornado might come . __eou__ Yes . People should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming.So it's called a " watch . " __eou__ And the second stage is called a " tornado warning " . __eou__ Yes . If a tornado has been spotted , they announce a " tornado warning " . So if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere . __eou__ It's scary . __eou__ Well . Tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true.If we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement . __eou__ What do you mean " a loud train " ? __eou__ That is what tornadoes sound like . They sound like trains . They're very loud . __eou__ But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ? __eou__ Maybe . It depends on the tornado.Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.That is very fast . Others aren't so fast . __eou__ Have you seen a lot of them ? __eou__ I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone . __eou__ Did it hit their house ? __eou__ No , it didn't . But they are glad I called them . __eou__ What were they doing when you called ? __eou__ They were all sitting in the living room watching TV.They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house.If it had hit them , they could have all been killed . __eou__ That's terrible . Do many people die in tornadoes ? __eou__ Not so many really . But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes . __eou__
Actually the general manager is regarded as a baby doll . He has much sympathy . __eou__ That's right . And his wife is a baby doll , too . She used to have many followers . __eou__ Were you one of them ? __eou__ Nothing of the sort . I can't hold a candle to her . __eou__
You know that this afternoon's meeting is cancelled , right ? __eou__ Why am I always the last to know these things ? __eou__ I sent out a notice . You've stopped checking your e-mail ? __eou__ No , but Bean did send me like a hundred forwards today . My mailbox must have been overflowing . __eou__ How obnoxious ! I heard he was sending you dirty jokes . __eou__ He not only sent me nasty e-mail , but he's so bored , he even asked me to search the Net for even more forwards for him ! __eou__
Stop running around in front of the TV , will you ? Why don ’ t you just sit and watch ? __eou__ I've tried , but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program . __eou__ Then stay away . Nobody's keeping you from doing that . __eou__ Don't be so irritable . I just don't understand the program , that's all . __eou__ All right , I will explain it to you later on . Now scram . __eou__ Ok . I will wait until you have had your fun , if that's what you want . __eou__ That's exactly what I want , thank you . __eou__
How did your interview go ? __eou__ Pretty well . I don't know if I'll get the promotion or not , but I feel good about it . __eou__ If you get the promotion , what will your new title be ? __eou__ If I get the promotion , I will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer . __eou__ Will you get a pay-raise , too ? __eou__ Whenever you are given added responsibilities , you should get a promotion . __eou__ That makes sense . Who interviewed you ? __eou__ My boss . __eou__ What kinds of questions did she ask you ? __eou__ She asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be . __eou__ The second one sounds rather difficult to answer . What did you tell her ? __eou__ I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally . __eou__ Those are good answers . How did she react ? __eou__ She told me that even when I become a senior engineer , I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team . __eou__ What do you think about her as a boss ? __eou__ She's pretty easy to get along with . She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally . __eou__ You're lucky . Not everyone has such a great boss ! __eou__ That's true . She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company . __eou__ When you find out you get the promotion or not , let me know . __eou__ I will do . __eou__

Jordan is the only good player Washington has . __eou__
How are your parents these days ? __eou__ Oh , they're fine , still very active and enjoying their retirement . __eou__ Oh , good . That's nice to hear . Please give my best regards to them when you're home . __eou__ Sure , thank you . __eou__

I don't think the teacher had a right to say that.The teacher was wrong to have accused her in front of the whole class . __eou__ You've got to be joking ! It's the teacher's right to say anything wants , and if she saw Myra cheating , she certainly had the right to say so . __eou__ I agree she had the right to say something , but I feel she should have done it privately . __eou__ You're right.If I were the teacher , I wouldn't have done that . __eou__

I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo . __eou__ Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ? __eou__ I'm really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders . __eou__ You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ? __eou__ You might think this strange , but I like the category for “ best foreign language film " . __eou__ It ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the “ best actor and actress ” . __eou__

You must be pretty excited about your trip to Europe . When is it that you are leaving ? __eou__ In just three weeks , and I am excited . But there are still a few things I need to do before I go . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Like renewing my passport , going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while I'm gone . __eou__ You are not going to give it up , are you ? __eou__ No way . I'll never find another apartment around here . But I don't like the idea of paying three months ' rent on an empty apartment , either . __eou__ I don't blame you . Perhaps you could sublet it . __eou__ Yes , but whom to ? __eou__ Mmm ... let me think . Oh , I know just a person . An old colleague of mine , Jim Thomas , is coming here to do some research this summer , from June to August . __eou__ That's exactly when I'll be away . It sounds ideal , as long as the landlord agrees . __eou__ Tell you what , I'll be calling Jim late this week anyway , so I'll mention it to him then . __eou__ Well , thanks , Bill . Let me know what happens . That extra money will really come in handy . __eou__

How's your business ? __eou__ Everything seems to be getting worse . I don't know what to do with it . __eou__ Things are tough all over .

I like summer but I don't like winter . __eou__ Is it very cold in winter ? __eou__ Yes , it is.But it's nice in spring and fall . __eou__
God , I didn ’ t realize . I didn ’ t , I didn ’ t know ... __eou__ ... Who you were with ? I didn ’ t know whom you were with . __eou__ Excuse me ? __eou__ Sorry , it ’ s from the Godfather . It ’ s when the , when the movie producer realizes Tom Higgins had emissary of Vito Corleone , it ’ s just before the horse ’ s head ends up in the bed with all the bloody sheets , you know , wakes up , and AAAL ! Never mind . __eou__ You were spying on me , weren ’ t you ? You probably rented those children . __eou__ Why would I spy on you ? __eou__ Because I am your competition which you know perfectly well , or you would not put up that sign just around the corner . __eou__ The entrance to our store is around the corner . And there ’ s no other way of saying that . It ’ s not the name of our store . It ’ s where it is . And you do not own the phrase around the corner . __eou__ What is that ? What are you doing ? You ’ re taking all the caviar ! That caviar is a garnish ? __eou__ Look , the reason I came into your store is because I was spending the day with Annabell and matt . And I was buying them presents . I ’ m the type of guy who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his relative . And there ’ s only one place to find a children ’ s book in the neighborhood . That will not always be the case . And it was yours . And it is a charming little bookstore . You probably sell what 350,000 worth of books in a year . __eou__
Hi , do you know what ’ s for dinner ? I ’ m starving . __eou__ We ’ re on our own tonight , dad ’ s taking mom out . __eou__ Out ?

Do you want to order some pizza ? __eou__
Have you been in America long , Hellen ? __eou__ No . Only for a couple of weeks . __eou__ Where are you going to study ? __eou__ I am going to register at Harvard next month . __eou__ What are you going to major in ? __eou__ I am going to major in tourism . What about you ? How long have you been here ? __eou__ For nearly four years . __eou__ Well . You should be able to give me some advice on where to stay .

After they saw how she crushed WebTracker ... but I guess you know all about that . __eou__
Why don't you have dinner with me tonight ? __eou__ I'd love to . __eou__ Let's say about 6:00 ? __eou__ That's OK with me . __eou__

They're carrying bottles of champagne ! __eou__ That's because it's time . __eou__ Time for what ? __eou__ It's time to make our wedding wish come true ... __eou__ You mean get married now ? On the plane ? __eou__ Why not ? I've got the rings ready . __eou__ I don't know what to say , Jack ! __eou__ Hopefully , you'll say " yes " ... __eou__

We have invited all our relatives to the wedding . __eou__ It will be a large church one . Is your wedding dress ready ? __eou__ Yes , its design is very elaborate and the designer took many weeks to make it . __eou__ You will be very beautiful on your wedding day . __eou__ Thank you ! __eou__ Which hotel will the reception be held at ? __eou__ The Palace Hotel . __eou__ It's excellent . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . __eou__ It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth . __eou__ I think you made the right decision . __eou__

Hey , Jeff , where's your stereo ? __eou__ I needed some money , so I hocked it last week . __eou__ You must have been really hurting for cash to have done that . __eou__ I had just enough money to make ends meet until payday . Then last Wednesday I received a phone bill to the tune of $ 195.00 . I hit the ceiling when I saw that . __eou__ It sounds like you weren't expecting that . __eou__ I'd forgotten that my brother had used my phone earlier this month to call his girlfriend . He forgot to mention that she happened to be in New York at the time 3000 miles away . __eou__ Well , if you need some money to tide you over until payday , I can loan you some . __eou__ Thanks , but tomorrow's payday I can make until then . Thanks any-way . __eou__
So what are you doing for Thanksgiving ? __eou__ Not much really . It's more of an American tradition , so back home we don't really celebrate it . In fact , I am not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated ! __eou__ Well you know , it's a time to get together with all your family and be thankful for everything ! __eou__ Yeah but , how did this holiday come to be ? __eou__ Well , the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James . Once in the New World , they befriended an native named Squanto , who taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn . __eou__ And then what did happen ? __eou__ Well , they had enough harvests for the next winter and celebration 。 They decided to have a big feast for the natives , giving thanks the land , and everyone for the foods , healthy and new lives . __eou__ Interesting ! I am amazed how big and delicious thanksgiving dinners are ! __eou__ Come to my house for Thanksgiving ! We are having turkey , pumpkin pie , mashed potatoes with gravy , and lots of stuffing ! __eou__ Count me in ! __eou__
Cheers ! To our first night in our new apartment . __eou__ It's so quiet . I'm not really used to it . __eou__ All you hear is the crickets and the breeze . __eou__ It's a little eerie . I'm sure the silence will begin to grow on me . __eou__ Well , I think it's fabulous . And the neighbors don't even seem to exist . __eou__ That is a relief . It's a good thing we moved . __eou__
Ms . : Do you have a question , Mary ? __eou__ No . That's not why I raised my hand . I need to go to the ladies ' room . __eou__ Ms . : Let me give you a hall pass for it . __eou__ What's a hall pass ? __eou__ Ms . : With a hall pass , you can go to the ladies ' room or wherever you need to go during class time . __eou__ I see . __eou__ Ms . : If a teacher stops you in the hallway , just show him or her the pass . __eou__ Or else I'll get into trouble . __eou__ Ms . : That's right . __eou__
What do you think of the speech the man delivered just now ? __eou__ Don't believe him . He's a liar . __eou__ We cannot expect politics to be true anyway . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__
So , you friend ’ s getting married on Saturday . What have you bought her as a wedding gift . I find is so hard to choose the right gift . __eou__ My friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name by the item they will buy . __eou__ That ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ? __eou__ Most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home . __eou__ So , what did you get them ? __eou__ I bought a sewing machine . I know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with it ? __eou__ She says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . When she uses it , it makes a funny noise . __eou__ Household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays . __eou__ I think it ’ s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . Because they know that we will buy the new models , the appliances don ’ t need to last more than five or ten years at most . __eou__
hey , Jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the TV all day . Anything interesting on TV ? __eou__ not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements . __eou__ why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air . __eou__ I know , I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world ! __eou__ Really ? What's the series about ? __eou__ well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it . __eou__ it sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth . __eou__ I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results . __eou__ really ? that's interesting ! __eou__ yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good . __eou__ OK , I'll give it a go . __eou__
I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere ! __eou__ So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ? __eou__ That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! __eou__ Have you ever written up a business plan before ? __eou__ Well , no.it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? __eou__ You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . __eou__ Well , that seems easy enough . __eou__ Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . __eou__ Geez . Is that all ? __eou__ Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! __eou__ Umm . I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business ! __eou__
Are you a blogger ? __eou__ Sure I am . I've been writing a blog for almost three years . __eou__ Oh , it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs . When did you get started ? __eou__ I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides . __eou__ What do you usually write about ? __eou__ At first , I'll write about my life there . Like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes , I'll post my pictures on my blog so my friends and family can get to know how everything's going . __eou__ That's interesting . How often do you write a blog ? __eou__ It's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks . __eou__ Got it . Are you still updating your blog ? __eou__ Sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like . __eou__ Good for you . I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months . __eou__
What are you doing this Saturday ? __eou__ Not much . __eou__ Do you want to go see a movie ? __eou__ That sounds good . __eou__ What's playing at the Century Fox ? __eou__ Candlelight in the Window __eou__ Should we go see it ? __eou__ I'd rather not . I don't like horror movies . __eou__ How about ‘ Run of the Mill ? ’ __eou__ No . I heard that's really boring . __eou__ Why don't we go to a concert instead ? __eou__ Great idea ! __eou__
Hello , My name is Candy Brown . May I have your name ? __eou__ Hello , Candy . My name is Jim White . Nice to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you , too . Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from New Orleans . What about you ? __eou__ I was born here . __eou__ Really ? This is a beautiful town . __eou__ It's nice talking to you . But I have to go . __eou__ OK . Can I have your phone number ? __eou__ OK . It's 15066688866 . Call me ! Bye-bye , then . __eou__ I will . Bye . __eou__
It's a lovely day , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , the weather sure is nice today . __eou__ I love it when the weather is like this.Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ? __eou__ That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot . __eou__ I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado ; but I must admit , this sure is a nice spring day . __eou__ Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable . __eou__ Okay.Hey , is that a dark cloud over there ? Do you think it will rain after all ? __eou__ I don't think so . I say the weather report last night , and it said the weather should be fine all day . __eou__ If the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend.It ' s been a while since I've not really gotten some sun . __eou__
I hear that you have been promoted . Congratulations on your promotion ! __eou__ Thank you , but I hate having to leave here and working abroad . __eou__ When are you going ? __eou__ Sometime next month . __eou__
I need your help , Bob . __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ I'm really confused by these annoying abbreviations . __eou__ Just relax . That's because you're new to chat . Let me take a look . __eou__ A / S / L , IGP , H & K , and ZZZ . What the hell do they mean ? __eou__ ZZZ means'sleepy or tired or bored ' , A / S / L is tricky , which is often used at first encounter . It's a three-word question , ' age , / sex / location ? ' __eou__ Interesting . Then what does H & K refer to ? The city of Hong Kong ? __eou__ Wrong . lt's not a place name , but a passionate act . __eou__ Really ? What kind ? A girl left this word to me , and I thought she was in Hong Kong . __eou__ Ahahah ... you miss her point for sure . H & K actually is an acronym for ' hug and kiss ' . __eou__ Hug and kiss ? ! How is it possible ? Oh , it's really bad to Miun - Verstand her meaning . __eou__ Yeah , seems that you have a lot to learn and memorize . __eou__
why are you in such a good mood today ? __eou__ well , yesterday , I decided to face my fear of heights . __eou__ I didn't know you were scared of heights ! Was it really bad ? __eou__ let me put it this way . I've never seen a professional sorts game in a stadium because I could never get myself to walk to the top of the stairs to sit down . __eou__ so what did you do about it yesterday ? __eou__ I went sky-diving ! __eou__ you're kidding me ! that sounds really scary ! __eou__ It was scary , but it felt great , too . __eou__ weren't you scared ? __eou__ of course I was scared . But I had an instructor that went with me and that helped . __eou__ so have you cured your fear of heights ? __eou__ I think so . After I jumped out of the plane , I realized that I should just enjoy life . Worrying about it or not doing things out of fear is just plain silly . __eou__ I'm impressed . __eou__ are you scared of anything ? __eou__ well , sometimes I get scared when I'm in my apartment all by myself . __eou__ what do you think is going to happen ? __eou__ I always worry that the door is unlocked or that a window is open and that a stranger will come in and steal my things . __eou__ it sounds like you just need to be more careful . __eou__
Look out ! __eou__ What's it ? __eou__ You must have rolled over something just now . __eou__ What you said gives me the creeps ! __eou__
Mr . Green , I ’ d like to introduce you to Mr . Brown . __eou__ How do you do , Mr . Brown ? It ’ s a pleasure to get to know you . __eou__ My pleasure , Mr . Green . I look forward to an excellent relationship with your company . __eou__ I propose a toast to the health of everyone here and to the success of our negotiation . __eou__ Okay , let ’ s make a toast . __eou__
So who does he think he is , anyway , I can't believe the way that my boss has been ordering everyone around lately , I mean , it's now like he is the CEO , or anything . __eou__ Um ... Actually I am guessing you didn't get the MEMO . Your boss was selected to fill the vacancy in the CEO slot . He actually is the CEO now , or will be , as soon as the official press releases and hoopla is done with . __eou__ Yikes ! you are joking , right ? I can't believe it . No wonder he is so stressed and bossy lately . I thought he was just being ostentatious by giving orders to people and all the different departments . What big shoes to fill ! __eou__ No kidding ! When the last CEO left , we were worried about the future of the company . __eou__ What does a CEO do anyway ? I know the CEO makes the most money in the company , but what does he actually do ? __eou__ He is responsible to the board of directors for everything that happens in the company . He or she must give leadership to all company officers , as CEO is also responsible for providing the guidance of philosophy of the company , and acting as official representative , or face of the company . __eou__ Must be one smart guy . __eou__
Okay , can I ask you something direct ? __eou__ Ha ! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush . __eou__ Fair enough . Give it to me straight . Did she bully you into this ? __eou__ No , seriously . . . I really want this . __eou__ I tell ya , when I got the invite , it really threw me for a loop . You've done a complete 180 . __eou__ I know . But things have changed . I guess I've settled down . __eou__ I guess so . __eou__
Have you ever been in an earthquake ? __eou__ Yes , I experienced one when I was in Tokyo once . The tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over . __eou__ Do you know where it measured on the Richter scale ? __eou__ I don't remember , but it wasn't very serious . Have you ever been in an earthquake ? __eou__ No , but I was in quite a few tornados when I was younger . __eou__ Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from the plains of the Midwest . It's a prime location for tornadoes . __eou__ Did your house ever get damaged from the winds ? __eou__ Most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room . __eou__ Wow , that must have really been scary . __eou__ Actually , some of my fon best memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass . __eou__ Have you ever experiences a flood ? __eou__ No , but my father's car was destroyed in a flood once . It actually happened the day after he bought the car ! __eou__ That sure didn't last long ! __eou__
There is a tornado warning on . My mother just told me she heard it on the radio . __eou__ What is a tornado warning ? __eou__ It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area . __eou__ Really ? In New Berlin ? __eou__ No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a tornado watch . That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado . __eou__ I understand . They think a tornado might come . __eou__ Yes . People should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming.So it's called a watch . __eou__ And the second stage is called a tornado warning . __eou__ Yes . If a tornado has been spotted , they announce a tornado warning.So if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere . __eou__ It's scary . __eou__ Well . Tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true.If we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement . __eou__ What do you mean a loud train ? __eou__ That is what tornadoes sound like . They sound like trains . They're very loud . __eou__ But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ? __eou__ Maybe . It depends on the tornado.Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.That is very fast . Others aren't so fast . __eou__ Have you seen a lot of them ? __eou__ I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone . __eou__ Did it hit their house ? __eou__ No , it didn't . But they are glad I called them . __eou__ What were they doing when you called ? __eou__ They were all sitting in the living room watching TV.They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house.If it had hit them , they could have all been killed . __eou__ That's terrible . Do many people die in tornadoes ? __eou__ Not so many really . But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes . __eou__
Is this your brother-in-law ? __eou__ Yes , he married my sister ten years ago . __eou__ From his looks , I'd say he's a man of character . __eou__ Yes , my sister loves his personality . __eou__
What about you , Ernie ? How did you get into pop music ? __eou__ Well I always hear it on the radio , so I started to get into it . __eou__ Yeah , if something is on the radio it must be really good . __eou__ I totally agree ! __eou__
Hello , Mary . Why are you standing here in the cold wind ? __eou__ I ’ m waiting for a bus and going for a walk in the park . __eou__ Going for a walk in such a cold weather ? __eou__ I always like to go for a walk before a supper . __eou__ I see . __eou__
Can you tell Bob from Tom ? __eou__ How can I ? They're as alike as two peas in a pod . __eou__ Don't you notice that Bob has a mole on his face , but Tom does not . __eou__ You really have keen eyes . __eou__
I have a problem . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ My mattress was supposed to be delivered today . __eou__ Is there a problem ? __eou__ The delivery people showed up four hours late . __eou__ I apologize for their tardiness . __eou__ I was late for work because of them . __eou__ Again , I do apologize for the inconvenience . __eou__ I want my money back for the delivery . __eou__ Seeing as they were late , that won't be a problem . __eou__ It shouldn't be a problem . __eou__ I'm going to refund your money right now . __eou__
Hi , my name is Pete . You are Ann . Isn't that right ? __eou__ Hi Pete , how do you know my name ? __eou__ Do you see that girl in the red top ? She told me who you were . __eou__ Oh Andrea , the Spanish girl ? __eou__ Yes , that's her . __eou__ I met her last week at a party . Anyway , you must be from the United States ? __eou__ Actually I live in London , but my family lives in Seattle . __eou__ Oh , I am from London as well . __eou__ Where in London do you live ? __eou__ In Wimbledon - quite close to the tennis courts actually . Which is very nice because I love tennis . __eou__ I play tennis there every week . Shall we have a game one day ? __eou__ That would be lovely . But now let's go and get a drink . __eou__
Every year , the South has the floods . It is an act of God . __eou__ Do you really think so ? __eou__ Yeah , you have some other ideas ? __eou__ Think , in some way it is an act of God , but in another way , it just is caused by us . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ We didn't pay attention to the environment , cut down trees and polluted the air . __eou__ Oh , I see . Fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things . __eou__
John got a heart attack last night . __eou__ Oh really ? Is he all right ? __eou__ Not so good , though his nephew took him to hospital in time . __eou__ Poor old John ! I am ever so sorry . __eou__
Watch out ! You're too close to the fire place . __eou__ Don't worry , but my clothes are made of leathers . __eou__ Really ? That's wonderful ! __eou__ Thank you for your warning . __eou__ Not at all . __eou__ Be careful of yourself . __eou__
You talked like the Terminator for two months ? Wow , I think you liked that movie even more than I liked ' Titanic . ' Why did you like ' Terminator ' so much ? __eou__ Well , ' Terminator ' is a really great action movie , and I like action movies because they're exciting . __eou__ Isn't ' Terminator ' really violent ? I usually don't like gory movies because they gross me out . __eou__ It is pretty violent , but since it's just robots fighting one another , it isn't very bloody and so it won't gross you out . __eou__ Hmm ... I don't know . Even though it may not be gory , I think it would still totally freak me out . __eou__
So do you believe in palmistry ? __eou__ Palmistry ? What is that ? __eou__ It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm 4 to tell the future . __eou__ Oh , you mean palm reading 5 . I've seen that before , but I don't believe in it . __eou__ Are you sure ? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . Do you want me to take a look at your hand ? __eou__ Really ? You've read books about it ? Ok , then . But only if you want to . __eou__ Ok , let's see , well , you've got a long life line , which is good , and the love line is strong ... __eou__ What else do you see ? Will I be successful ? Will I make a lot of money ? __eou__ Hmm , hard to say , wait , yes , it looks like you will do well in business , and your ambition will help you a lot , but ... __eou__ What ? What is it ? What's the matter ? __eou__ You seem to have a large gullibility line . You believe everything that you're told . __eou__ Hey ! __eou__
I heard through the grapevine that Michael probably become the new sales manager . __eou__ How did you get wind of the rumor ? __eou__ I am not a rumor monger . __eou__ Let ’ s stop gossiping and get back to work . __eou__

Her birthday is next week . __eou__ And when is your son's birthday ? __eou__ That is not for a while . His birthday is only in August . __eou__ But Mark's birthday is in April so I need to think about his present soon . __eou__ And when is your birthday ? __eou__ Oh , my birthday is in December just before Xmas so of course nobody remembers . __eou__ My birthday is in June , when we are always on holiday . So my family often forgets my birthday too . __eou__
Thank you very much for everything you have done for me during my stay in China . __eou__ And I must thank you again for your generous help . __eou__ The help is mutual . I must thank you to see me off . My wife and I will be looking forward to seeing you . You will come to see us , won't you ? __eou__ I promise I will take the first chance to call on you . Please send your wife with my best regards . __eou__
How do you usually spend your leisure time ? I mean , do you have any special interests out of your job ? __eou__ Of course . You see , almost everyone has some kind of hobby __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re quite right and what ’ s your hobby ? __eou__ I like taking photos out of door . __eou__ Oh , photography , It ’ s really a good hobby . __eou__ Yes , I usually develop and print all my own photos . __eou__ You yourself have a photo studio ? __eou__ Yes , simple as it is . t does work . __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , can I return this article , please ? __eou__ May I know the reason , madam ? __eou__ You see , I bought it for my husband , but he doesn't like it . __eou__ When did you buy it ? __eou__ Last Saturday . __eou__ Can I see the receipt ? __eou__ Yes , here you are . __eou__ Well , if there is no damage , you can return it . __eou__
hey , Lily , what are you doing ? __eou__ waiting for someone . __eou__ you mean the boy you met on MSN ? __eou__ you're right . He is so funny and I think I'm in love with him . __eou__ you must be joking . You can't fall in love with someone you've never met ! __eou__ I know , but I keep thinking of him every day . And I get really depressed when he's not online . __eou__ I think it's just a crush . You can't be serious . __eou__ well , this might be silly . But I just can't get him off my mind . And I can't help missing him . __eou__ did you tell him ? __eou__ yes . He said I'm his dream girl . __eou__ you shouldn't take it too seriously . It might be a lie . __eou__ I know . I can't tell whether he's serious or not so I need your advice . __eou__ I think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends , and then the right person will come along . __eou__
hi , Natasha , how's life ? __eou__ great . My family came to visit me . __eou__ oh , you must be very happy . How many people are there in your family ? __eou__ my immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me . __eou__ I have a small family . They are my parents , my younger brother and me . __eou__ I thought you were the only child in the family . Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ? __eou__ yes , it did . But my parents are ethnic minority people . It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children . __eou__ interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ? __eou__ the child must feel very longly . My younger brother is 10 years younger than me . Before he was born , I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one da __eou__ do you get along well with each other ? __eou__ yes , we are very close . He is 12 years old and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot . __eou__ you are very lucky to have such a nice family . __eou__ thank you . __eou__
Is there a city where it's always warm ? __eou__ Yes , there are many cities where it's almost always warm.San Diego , for example . __eou__ Are there any other cities where it's always hot ? __eou__ Many.Most of the cities in the southern part of the United States are hot all year . __eou__ But why do so many people live there ? __eou__ Most people grow accustomed to the climate , but there are many others who complain about it all the time . __eou__ Are there any cities where it rains a lot ? __eou__ Several.Two good examples are Seattle , in the state of Washington , and Portland , Oregon . __eou__ Tell us about some cold cities . __eou__ In the north there are many cities which are very cold in the winter.Boston and Chicago are two of them . __eou__ Is it always cold in Chicago and Boston ? __eou__ Oh , no.On the contrary , there are many beautiful days , especially in the spring and fall . __eou__
Did you read this ? It says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family . __eou__ Why would that be funny ? __eou__ Well , think about it . We are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to , but because we want to . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary . __eou__ I don ’ t agree , but anyways , I think you should start thinking of a new year ’ s resolution yourself . __eou__ What ’ s the point ? We always make a new year ’ s resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it . It ’ s pointless . __eou__ Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives . __eou__ What about you ? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in . __eou__ Well , I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday ! __eou__ Yeah , yeah , whatever . __eou__
You don ’ t look like enjoying this workout . __eou__ I ’ m not crazy about it at all . __eou__ You don ’ t like this sort of exercise ? __eou__ I ’ m not interested in it . Are you keen on it ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s funny . I thought you liked it . __eou__ I hate it . __eou__ Never mind . It ’ ll be over in 10 minutes . __eou__ It ’ s the worst thing I ’ Ve ever tried . __eou__
Bye . Take care . __eou__ You too . __eou__
I'm afraid I've had a terrible row with my boss . What shall I do ? __eou__ I think you'd better apologize . __eou__ Oh , but I can't . It wasn't my fault . __eou__ Maybe not , but I advice you to say it was your fault . __eou__
Jack , what are you doing ? __eou__ I am reading . __eou__ I can see that . But why are you reading advertisements for houses for sale ? Are you buying a house ? __eou__ No , not yet . But I like to see what is available . __eou__ Can I have a look as well ? __eou__ Of course , have a seat . __eou__ Oh , this one looks really good . And look at the garden . So beautiful . __eou__ Yes , nice . But I prefer this wooden house with a garden fence and a sloping roof . __eou__ Yes , but my house has large windows and so gets lots of sun . And it has a small balcony at the top . __eou__ Well , you can't compare a small balcony to this large veranda . This is perfect for having a barbecue in summer . __eou__ Talking about a barbecue , didn't you say you are organizing one next week ? __eou__ Yes , next Saturday . I hope you can make it . __eou__
John , do you mind helping me prepare for the picnic ? __eou__ Sure . Have you checked the weather report ? __eou__ Yes . It says it will be sunny all day . No sign of rain at all . __eou__ I'd like some toast and chicken wings . __eou__ Okay . Please take some fruit salad and crackers for me . __eou__ Done . Oh , don't forget to take napkins , disposable plates , cups and picnic blanket . __eou__ That's great . We can also take the dragon kite with us . After the picnic , we can fly it . __eou__ Cool , we can take shuttlecock and badminton racket . __eou__ Okay , it sounds good . __eou__
How ’ s your trip going ? __eou__ Oh I ’ m enjoying myself but it ’ s so hot here __eou__ Isn ’ t London hot in the summer ? __eou__ Well it can be but Shanghai is much warmer than London . __eou__ I see . What about transport ? How does Shanghai compare to London ? __eou__ Actually I think the buses and trains here are more modern . __eou__ And what about the number of people on the streets ? __eou__ Oh , I think Shanghai is much more crowded than London . __eou__
Mom , can you talk about the philosophy of life with me ? __eou__ You got me on that one . __eou__
Do you like the Harry potter books and movies ? __eou__ Not really ! __eou__ Why not ? They are very fun and exiting . __eou__ Maybe , but I think they are just for kids . __eou__ No , that ’ s not true . Many adults like the Harry potter books too . __eou__ Maybe they don ’ t agree with my taste . __eou__
Hi , Anna . I haven ’ t seen you for ages . Where have you been ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been away on holidays for sometime . __eou__ No wonder I haven ’ t seen you recently . Where did you spend your holidays ? __eou__ I went with my husband . Our first stop was Bangkok . We stayed there for 5 days . Then we flew to Hong Kong , stopover for 3 days . Our last stop was China . We visited the Great Wall . __eou__ You must have a wonderful time . __eou__ Yes . We enjoyed ourselves very much . Have you traveled much , Luke ? __eou__ No , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . We haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . We spent our honeymoon in the Alps . __eou__ Oh , I see . Yeah . Some people like traveling , some don ’ t . My husband didn ’ t like traveling at first , either . He said what ’ s the use of traveling ? A waste of money and a waste of time.At last I got him on the move . After all , he loved me . We went to Bali , Indonesia , one of the most beautiful places in the world . That trip left a very deep impression on him . Since then whenever we have holidays and money , we ’ d like to patronize the travel agency . Isn ’ t it a bit dull to shut yourself at one place all your life ? __eou__
Hey , the pool's open now ! __eou__ As of today it is . Memorial Day marks the end of the school year and the beginning of summer . __eou__ So it's time for the kids to get outdoors ... __eou__ ... and for us to get tans in our new bikinis . __eou__ Not this Taiwanese girl . We don't like to get suntans . __eou__ That's smart these days with all the news on skin cancer . Hey , there's everybody ! We made it ! __eou__
Donna , you really shocked everyone at the party last night ! __eou__ You mean with my performance ? __eou__ Yes ! We have all assumed that you were the quiet , shy type . __eou__ I guess everyone has a few secrets up their sleeve . __eou__ Where did you learn to sing like that ? __eou__ I was part of a band in school . __eou__ You ? Wow . And why don't you ever dress like that at work ? __eou__ Come on ! This is work . Don't you think that would be a little weird ? __eou__
Would you like to join the drama club ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Why do you want to join it ? __eou__ It's very exciting . I think . __eou__
Hey man ! How ’ s it hanging ? __eou__ Hey man ! Everything is just groovy baby ! __eou__ Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday ? I heard it was far out , man ! __eou__ I wanted to , but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block ! I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place . __eou__ Right on , right on ! Well , Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dy-no-mite ! He was low on bread , but Sherry paid for everything . __eou__ Gravy ! Jim is such a jive turkey man . He is always hitting me up for cash . Anyway , you wanna book and go grab some grub ? __eou__ Yeah man , I ’ m starving ! __eou__
Did you do anything fun over the weekend ? __eou__ I didn't want to go out last weekend , so I decided to stay at home and watch a movie . __eou__ Why didn't you want to go out ? __eou__ I was very tired after working all week . Sometimes on the weekend I don't have enough energy to go out to a movie theater . __eou__ Did you download a movie or rent it at the store ? __eou__ I downloaded it so that I didn't have to remember to return it . __eou__
I'm not a VIP . __eou__ You're too humble . __eou__
Is there a lot of crime in your city ? __eou__ There ’ s some , but I don ’ t think it ’ s a big problem . A lot of it is petty crime , burglary and car theft . There ’ s very little major crime . __eou__ It ’ s the same in my city . We also have a lot of drug addicts . A lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs . __eou__ That happens in many places . In my city , there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . The police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes , but I don ’ t know if that ’ s the reason for our relatively low crime rate . __eou__ Some people believe that a tough approach is better . Other prefer a more lenient approach . __eou__ I think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . If most people have similar amounts of money , they will not think of stealing from others . __eou__ That ’ s possible , but I ’ m not sure it would really happen like that . __eou__
I really should be on my way . __eou__ Oh , don ’ t go yet . Let ’ s at least have one more . __eou__ No , thank you . I can ’ t . __eou__ It ’ s too bad that you have to leave so early . __eou__ Thank you very much . I had a really good time . __eou__ Thanks for coming ! We should meet again sometime soon . __eou__ That would be great ! Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That ’ s assuming you don ’ t mind if I call you sometime . __eou__ Anytime .

Bye ! Ben . __eou__
He said he will get married by the end of this month . __eou__ Big talk , I ’ d say . He does not have a girlfriend yet . __eou__ Who knows . After all , he is handsome and rich . __eou__
My son closed his ear to what I said . I don ’ t know what I should do . __eou__ You can twist his arm in order to have a control of him . __eou__ I cannot have the heart to do that . __eou__
I got a raise . __eou__ I'm glad to hear that . __eou__
I would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans . __eou__ Really ? I ’ m not sure that I would like all the attention . There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star ’ s private live in recent years . __eou__ I love being photographed ! If I were famous , I ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines , like cosmo and elle . __eou__ I wouldn ’ t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice , but it would get tedious after a while . Imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you . __eou__ no-one really believes gossip columnists . __eou__ I think you ’ ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . You ’ d also have to be very careful about every word you said . If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly , it would be reported in all the newspapers and magazines . __eou__ I think you ’ re right about that . I ’ d need a good manager to be my spokesperson . I could do a lot of charity work , which would help a lot of people . __eou__ That ’ s a great idea . Which charities would you support ? __eou__ I love children , as you know , so probably a children ’ s charity . __eou__ You ’ d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity , so you ’ d really need to be very careful . Anyway , I ’ d be the first to buy your posters and I ’ d attend your first book-singing when you wrote your autobiography . __eou__ Thanks , but actually I was hoping I could ask you to write my biography . __eou__
Have you ever thought about Tom ’ s attitude ? __eou__ I ’ Ve cut it upland come to the conclusion that hi is actually sick of Jenny ’ s brother . But he likes Jenny . She is a big apple in his eye . __eou__ Love me , love my dog . He ’ s a sensible kind man . __eou__ That ’ s why many people look up to him . __eou__
What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? __eou__ I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . __eou__ Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done . __eou__ You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . __eou__
do you mind if I sit here ? __eou__ no , of course not . Go ahead . __eou__ don't I know you ? __eou__ yes , now that you mention it , I think we had a chemistry class together in high school . __eou__ you're right ! How are you ? It's been a long time ! __eou__ What did you do after high school ? __eou__ I went straight to university afterwards . What about you ? __eou__ I took a year off to go travelling . __eou__ that sounds exciting . Where did you go ? __eou__ I went all over the world . It was the best year of my life . Where did you go to school ? __eou__ I went to a small school in Connecticut . It has a very good reputation for its languages department . __eou__ Oh , did you study a foreign language ? __eou__ yes , I got a grant to study Chinese . __eou__ that's a very difficult language to learn , isn't it ? __eou__ it is , but it's very rewarding . __eou__ so you can speak Chinese ? __eou__ I can , but not as well as I'd like to . I'll be studying Chinese until the day I die ! __eou__ I think most languages take a lifetime to learn well . __eou__
Hi , Mary , I didn't see you at work this morning . Are you all right ? __eou__ Oh , I feel miserable . I've got a bad cold , My head is dizzy and my nose is running . __eou__ Oh , I'm so sorry to hear that . Have you seen a doctor or taken any medicines ? __eou__ As a matter of fact I have , The doctor said it'll go away after a day or two.He ' s prescribed me some tablets . __eou__ Are you feeling better ? __eou__ Yes , it helps me but I just have to wait and let my system do the work . __eou__ Do you need anything , grocery ? __eou__ Oh , no , I'm fine.My refrigerator is piled up with food.But if it's not too much trouble for you . I'd like something to read . __eou__ Sure , I'll get it for you.Books or magazines ? __eou__ I'd like both . __eou__
Sally , I ’ m tired of this Western food . I really miss my mother ’ s Sichuan cooking . __eou__ I ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ? __eou__ I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much . __eou__ I suppose you ’ re right , Lee . Maybe that ’ s why so many Westerners are overweight . __eou__ It ’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy . __eou__ You see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening . __eou__
I was thinking about applying for the new position . __eou__ Do you think that is a good idea ? __eou__ It seems like a good idea but I am not really sure . __eou__ What are your main concerns ? __eou__ Well , it would give me a chance to grow , but I am wondering if I would like the job . __eou__ I know what you mean , I've thought about that myself . __eou__ I am also thinking about the pay . __eou__ Could you take a slight pay decrease for a chance to move forward ? __eou__ Yes , it might be worth it . I am not certain . __eou__ I think I'm convinced that trying for this position is the best choice for you . __eou__
The murderer was sentenced to life imprisonment . __eou__ It ’ s severe punishment , I think . __eou__ Yeah , because he just killed a man in cold blood . __eou__ No wonder . __eou__
David , what have you been up to lately ? __eou__ I went on a trip with my family last week . __eou__ Really ? Where did you go ? __eou__ We went to Europe . __eou__ What cities did you go to ? __eou__ London , Paris and a few other cities . __eou__ Did you go to Berlin ? __eou__ No , We didn't go there . I'd like to go there next time . __eou__ I think this summer is a good time to visit Berlin . It's a beautiful place and the people there are very nice . __eou__ That's what I've heard . __eou__ I went there last year . If you want , I can give you some information I have about the city . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
Look at this survey conducted by a website . A quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . Hi , Francis , what about you ? __eou__ Well , I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . Anyway , I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave . __eou__ Though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , I don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that . __eou__ Certainly , work always comes first . __eou__ But it is lucky for us . The company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . I have shopped too often online these days . __eou__ Well , keep a low profile . __eou__
Have you started your report yet ? __eou__ I'm having a hard time getting the information . __eou__ It's easy . You only have to search the internet in order to get the information you're looking for . __eou__ Oh , I didn't think of that . __eou__

Where are you from , Laura ? __eou__ Well , my whole family is in the United States now , but we're from Costa Rica originally . __eou__ Oh , so you're from South America . __eou__ Actually , Costa Rica isn't in South America . It's in Central America . __eou__ Oh , right . My geography isn't very good ! __eou__
Flight BE407 to Rome is delayed . Will passengers please wait in the lounge . __eou__ Oh , How annoying ! __eou__ The time of departure will be announced as soon as possible . __eou__ It ’ s infuriating . I have to be in Rome by five . __eou__

Oh , there's about twenty million people in Australia right now . A little bit under , but close to twenty . __eou__ OK . What are the biggest cities ? __eou__ The biggest city ? The biggest city is Sydney , then it's followed by Melbourne and then Brisbane and then I think it's Perth . But most of the big cities are on the East Coast of Australia . And Perth is on the west coast , but sort of of out there by itself . __eou__ OK . Um , if you had to live in one place where would you live ? __eou__ I like Brisbane . I had my teenage years in Brisbane , growing up in Brisbane , um or maybe Sidney because it is a big city , but Brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine . __eou__ Oh , nice . Actually , what is the capital city of Australia ? __eou__ Ah , Canberra is the capital city . But is not the biggest city . Sydney is the biggest city . Canberra was made sort of by the politicians so Sydney wouldn't get to crowded . It's a separate territory . __eou__

You know , after work all you want to do is throw yourself onto your bed . And during the Weekend , you just want to stay at home and enjoy a family dinner . __eou__ Yes , you are right .

The company is selecting three employees to attend the marketing seminar next month . Did you put your name in for it ? __eou__ No , I don't really care too much for seminars ... I find them to be either boring ot useless . I mean , how much can you really learn in one afternoon ? __eou__ It's not just about the things that you learn , you know ... seminars are a really great opportunity to mingle and network with professionals in our industry from all over the nation .

Do you think what I did to Elvin was out of line ? __eou__ You could have tried to explain to him about the new programmers . __eou__ Elvin doesn't want any programming help .

Let ' s got out tomorrow night . We can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend . __eou__ I don ' t think that ' s a good idea . I am just not good with approaching someone and starting up a conversation . __eou__ Maybe you just need a few pick-up lines , you know , break the ice . __eou__ Pick-up lines don ' t work ! __eou__ Come on ! You can just walk up to a girl and say “ If you were a booger I \ ' d pick you first . ” __eou__ What ? Come on ! That ’ s just lame ! No girl would fall for that ! __eou__ Fine , then you can say , “ So there you are ! I ' Ve been looking all over for YOU , the woman of my dreams ! ” __eou__ That ' s a good one ! I think that ' s pretty funny . __eou__ Yeah , so you make her laugh , you make a fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy her a drink . __eou__ Ok , how does this sound , “ I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there . So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes . ” __eou__ Nice ! Let ' s go ! __eou__
At their last meeting , the stockholders voted unanimously to block the merger of our company with Blycore . All the executive committee was in favor of the merger ... I don't understand how the stockholders could have so much power to throw a wrench in the plans ... __eou__ If they all unite on a certain issue , it's the stockholders who have the final say . You'd think it might be our CEO or the workers , but in fact , the stockholders control the money so they have the most power . __eou__ Is it really that simple ? It doesn't seem very efficient to run things that way ... __eou__ It might not be the most efficient , but if you think about it , it makes pretty good sense . The stockholders are our investors . They own the capital in our company , so they should have say about what is done with the company . __eou__ I guess I'd buy that ... __eou__
Did you go to the concert last weekend ? __eou__ No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ? __eou__ Yes , I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist . __eou__ How much was the ticket ? __eou__ I only paid two dollars for mine . __eou__
Great ! I landed on Classic Movies . __eou__ I didn't know you liked old movies . __eou__ I love them , especially the all-time greats like Gone With the Wind . __eou__ You're so right ! Today's movies are just too commercial ! __eou__ Sometimes I think Oscars are only awarded to movies that make a lot of money . __eou__
Why are you asking me about my boyfriend ? __eou__ Well , Brad from school asked me out just today . __eou__ Brad Bush ? Good for you ! __eou__ But I don't know what to do . __eou__ You mean you've never had a boyfriend ? __eou__ My mom says no boyfriend until I'm in college . __eou__ Until college ? __eou__ Actually , that's what a lot of parents in Taiwan say to their kids . __eou__
Now that it ’ s the new year , I ’ Ve decided to turn over a new leaf . __eou__ Yeah ? You finally decided to wipe the slate clean ? __eou__ You got it ! I have a new job , I ’ m living in a new city , with new friends ! This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life . __eou__ So what are you going to do ? Take up an art class or something ? __eou__ Well , first of all , I ’ Ve decided to stop smoking . It ’ s not that I ’ m pinching pennies or anything , it ’ s just that I ’ Ve been smoking since I was sixteen , and I think it ’ s time to stop . __eou__ I ’ m with you on that one . Anything else you ’ re planning on doing ? __eou__ One last thing , I ’ Ve decided to come out of the closet . __eou__ It ’ s about time ! __eou__
Why are you in such a hurry ? __eou__ I should finish it as soon as possible . __eou__ Don't worry , do it step by step __eou__ Why can I learn it ? __eou__ Don't worry , do it step by step . __eou__ I feel I really stupid . __eou__
Hey , Frank , there is that Janet chick . __eou__ Wow , what a great burd ! __eou__ She sure knows how to strut her stuff . __eou__ She's a real turn-on , alright ? __eou__ And look out she's dressed . __eou__ Yeah , I noticed . She must be really loaded . __eou__ No way . Her old man is rich . He buys her anything she wants . __eou__ Lucky her . Anyway , I think that is just as beautiful . __eou__ I think you've lost it . __eou__ Well , that's my opinion . __eou__ I admit that she is much prettier than Kate . __eou__ Oh , there is no comparison . Now we are talking but ugly . __eou__ At least we agree on that . Let's go and get a drink . __eou__
Do you like swimming ? __eou__ Yes . Swimming is one of my most favorite sports , indoors or out-doors . __eou__ Me too . Swimming is a very good exercise for health . It combines water , bath , sunbath , and air bath together . It promotes the growth and haleness of muscles , bone , viscera and nerve systems . __eou__ I have never thought that swimming can bring us so many benefits . I only know that swimming in great waves and deep running water can train people's spirits , and enable people to be fearless of the hardships , dangers and difficulties and become brave and staunch . __eou__ Have you ever swum in a river or a lake ? __eou__ Yes , but not always . However , I won't let it go if I have a chance . __eou__
You should have seen the T . V . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights . __eou__ Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights . __eou__ Yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings . __eou__ I understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . If so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala . __eou__ You can ’ t compare apples and oranges . I believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching . __eou__ Well , you are right on that point . This is the reason that I don ’ t buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products . __eou__ At least you ’ re doing your part . My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family . __eou__ As long as you don ’ t treat it better than your wife , it ’ s fine . __eou__
So it looks like we start selling in the U . S . next year . __eou__ Did Mr . Lin put you in charge of marketing ? __eou__ He's still not sure whether he wants to put me in charge , or whether he wants to hire an American.But even if he hires an American , I'll probably be transferred to our American office . __eou__ Where will it be ? __eou__ We aren't sure yet . Maybe L . A . I think L . A . would be the best idea . __eou__ Is it because of trade negotiations that we can start selling in the U . S . ? __eou__ Yes , the recent agreements between the two governments have changed everything.Now we have the right to sell in America at a much lower tariff.It ' s going to be good . We can compete more directly with them . __eou__ Great . __eou__ Our computers have a high level of quality now.We can demonstrate it . And our prices will be good.So I think it will really be worthwhile . __eou__ You seem excited about it . __eou__ Well , you know I studied marketing in America.So maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me . I'd love to be part of the team . __eou__ Do you honestly think we can compete though ? All the computer giants are there . __eou__ Yes , I do . I think we can compete . I think we can make a name for ourselves.It will be hard at first . But if we develop a good advertising campaign , I think we can break into the market . __eou__ The company will have to choose a good advertising firm.And then there's the problem of quality.How do we convince American buyers that our quality is good ? __eou__ It takes some time.Because even if the quality is high , people won't accept a high tech product unless they recognize the name.Name recognition is crucial . __eou__ Well , I hope it all works out , John . I think if you're part of the team , things will go well.But you know we'd all miss you here . So I won't say I'm happy to think that you're leaving . __eou__ That's very nice of you to say.But if we set up an office there in the States , maybe you could try to become part of it . __eou__ Me ? No way . I'm dedicated to the company , but I'm not going to leave Taiwan . I'm happy here . __eou__
How are the children doing at sport ? __eou__ I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age . __eou__ He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ? __eou__ He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone hi __eou__ Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ? __eou__ The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes . __eou__ How are they at swimming ? __eou__ They ’ re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape . __eou__ Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters . __eou__ I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height ! __eou__ I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher . __eou__ It seems that they really enjoy to go faster , higher and further . __eou__
How many people are there in your family ? __eou__ Five . Besides my parents and me , there are my brother and sister . __eou__ That is a big family . How old is your sister ? __eou__ 15 . __eou__ What about your brother ? __eou__ He ’ s not quite 25 . __eou__ Do you miss your family ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Do you often go home ? __eou__ No . But I write to them often . __eou__ How often do you write to them ? __eou__ Once a month . __eou__
Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought . __eou__ You ’ re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football . __eou__ Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ? __eou__ The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone . __eou__ Wow ! What a hit ! __eou__ Yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off . __eou__ Is he ok ? __eou__ It looks like it , he ’ s getting up . __eou__ I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team . __eou__ The Giants ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Well , here we go again . __eou__ What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ? __eou__ The Redskin ’ s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . We ’ re losing again . __eou__
Who stands out in your mind as a man or woman of sound character ? __eou__ If I think of famous people , I think of Abraham Lincoln . __eou__ He's the US president , who walked five miles just to give a lady her change , isn't he ? __eou__ That's the one . He also was famous for never giving up on his goals . __eou__ That's right . He ran for office quite a few times before he was finally elected . __eou__ And I also admire him for his courage in fighting for equal rights . __eou__ He had great vision , didn't he ? __eou__ And humility . I would have liked to meet him personally . __eou__
What ’ s your working day like ? __eou__ I have a typical 9 to 5 job . Actually , I work a little longer than 9 to 5 most days . __eou__ Do you get paid onetime ? __eou__ No , I don ’ t . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients . __eou__ Do you have any breaks ? __eou__ We have an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 . we can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn ’ t mind , as long as we get out work done on time . __eou__ My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ There ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I don ’ t like it very much . __eou__ I work in a cubicle too , but I I don ’ t mind it . __eou__
Freeze ! __eou__ Don't shoot . I give up . __eou__
You know that ? Dan got a divorce . __eou__ Really ? I thought he loved his wife very much . __eou__ Yeah . But his relation with Sallycome to a sticky end and was found by his wife . __eou__ He deserved it . __eou__
Hello , is Jack there ? __eou__ Speaking . __eou__ Jack ! It ’ s Rose here . __eou__ Hi , Rose . How ’ s everything ? __eou__ Fine , thanks . I ’ m having several friends over for dinner this Saturday . And I was wondering if you have the time to join us . __eou__ Sounds good . What time do you want me to come ? __eou__ Is six o ’ clock okay ? __eou__
Joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? Let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ? __eou__ Fine with me . I just want to get this over with . It ’ s important we make a clean break . I should have signed a pre-nup . __eou__ What was that ? __eou__ Nothing ! Anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty . My lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement-I keep the cat and you get the dog . So that ’ s done ... finally . __eou__ Let ’ s not go there , Joanne ! Ok , so let ’ s start with the record collection , I ’ ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back . __eou__ Fine , but I ’ m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me . __eou__ I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it ! __eou__ He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! __eou__ Whatever ! Alright , I ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that I get the silver tea set . __eou__ How typical , when are you ever going to use a silver tea set ? Fine ! I don ’ t want to drag this out any longer than necessary . What ’ s next ? What about these old photographs ? __eou__ Which ones ? Let me have a look . Wow , look at that ! That brings back memories ... That ? __eou__ Our trip to Italy ! I remember that day . We were going to visit the Trev fountain , and we got caught in the rain ... __eou__ ... and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet . I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley , smiling and laughing in the rain ... __eou__ Oh , we really did have fun back then , didn ’ t we ? __eou__ Oh , Joanne , are we making a big mistake ? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? I still love you . __eou__ Oh Jeff ! I love you too ! I ’ m so glad we didn ’ t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle . __eou__ The motorcycle ? But that ’ s mine ! __eou__
What's the time now ? __eou__ Sorry , I don't know , there's something wrong with my watch . __eou__ You've simply forgotten to wind it up , have you ? When do you usually wind it up ? __eou__ In the coming , before going to work . __eou__ You got up so late today . You have , I think . Turn on the TV and set your watch by it . __eou__ OK . I'll turn it on . __eou__ All right . It's just four o'clock . __eou__ Well , I'm setting my watch at four . Thank you . __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__
Going to the gym tonight , Mary ? __eou__ Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong . __eou__ That sounds like fun.Would you mind some company ? __eou__ I'd love it.Working out is more fun with a friend . __eou__ I'll get my things and meet you there . __eou__ Good.If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong . __eou__
Whose part do you think is best played ? __eou__ That of the old man . __eou__ You're absolutely right ! That's the very figure I like best . __eou__ Some of the scenes moved me into tears . __eou__
We're having a tailgate party I before the game . Would you like to join us ? __eou__ Okay . But what is a tailgate party ? __eou__ Someone brings a truck to the game and we have a barbecue right there in the parking lot out of the back of the truck ! __eou__ How fun ! Can I bring something ? __eou__ Don't worry about it ! Just come at five . __eou__ I make a mean potato salad ! __eou__ Well , if you insist , you are welcome to bring a potato salad ! __eou__ Then I'll see you in the parking lot at five ! Thank you ! __eou__
What may I do for you ? __eou__ I need to get a passport . __eou__ You will need to apply for one . __eou__ When will I be able to do that ? __eou__ You can do it right now , if you ’ d like . __eou__ That ’ s fine . __eou__ Please fill out this application . __eou__ Then what do I do ? __eou__ I just need to take your picture . __eou__ How long will it take for my passport to be ready ? __eou__ You will get it in a few weeks . __eou__ That ’ s perfect . __eou__
I ’ Ve got this really neat idea , you can hire a car and drive straight there . __eou__ Are you nuts ? What would my friends think if they see me in a hired car ? __eou__ But that ’ s the quickest way to make your plans work . __eou__ Oh this is hard ! Well , I ’ ll see what I can do . __eou__
Would you please put that cigarette out ? I get sick on it . __eou__ You do ? OK , fine with me . __eou__ Thank you SO much . __eou__ But I also want ya to do me a favor . __eou__ What ? __eou__ You gotta have some better deodorant . __eou__ I ’ m sorry ? ! __eou__
I really hate to say this , but don't go away mad , just go away . __eou__ I knew this would happen some day . __eou__ Then , why didn't you try to prevent it in the beginning ? __eou__ Well . It's not all my fault , Anna . You are responsible , too . __eou__ I don't want to argue anymore . Please get out of my life ! __eou__ I think we can still talk . __eou__ No way ! Please don't follow me around . __eou__ Talk it easy , Anna . You really don't hate me . do you ? __eou__ Yes , I do . Leave me alone ! __eou__
It's a fine day today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it is.It ' s wonderful after the downpour . __eou__ How nice seeing the sun back again ! The air is so fresh . __eou__ I hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time . __eou__ Well , the weather is so unpredictable this time of year . __eou__ You're right.We don't know what is going to be like tomorrow . __eou__ Look ! It looks as if it is going to rain . __eou__ The weatherman predicts a fine day today . __eou__ The weather is often quite different from the weather forecast . __eou__
When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ? __eou__ Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter . __eou__ How about Sunday then ? __eou__ Yes , Sunday sounds fine . What time ? __eou__ Does 6 thirty suit you ? __eou__ It suits us fine . We ’ ll see you then . __eou__ Thanks , goodbye . __eou__
Hey , look ! They ’ re playing reruns of the 1996 Olympics . __eou__ Isn ’ t that Michael Johnson ? I think he set a world record in this race . __eou__ He completed the first 200 / 400 double in Olympic history ! __eou__ Are you sure ? What about Carl Lewis ? He won four golds , didn ’ t he ? __eou__ Carl won the gold in the 100 , 200 , long jump , and 4x100 relay in 1984 . __eou__ I like the way Carl runs . He looks more graceful . __eou__
Will you have time this Saturday evening to go to the cinema with me ? __eou__ Saturday ? Oh , I have a previous engagement . __eou__ What a pity ! Then how about Sunday ? __eou__ I've already got plans , too . __eou__ Then when do you think we could go out together ? __eou__ How about Friday ? Only in that day can I arrange it . __eou__ OK . Any time on Friday will be OK with me . __eou__ That's settled then . I'll contact you later . __eou__
Come on , fellows.Let ' s enjoy my wife's cooking ! __eou__ Em , it's delicious ! __eou__ Thank you ! My wife likes cooking very much . __eou__ You're lucky . __eou__
Guess what ! __eou__ What ? __eou__ I am going to the mountains with my family this weekend . __eou__ That sounds like fun . __eou__
Does Mr . Schmidt know he's going to become a father ? __eou__ No , and I have no way of getting ahold of him ! There's no phone where he's at ! __eou__ Well , he has a surprise waiting for him when he gets back , doesn't he ! __eou__ My older sister Judy will be here soon to help . She already has a boy and a girl of her own ... __eou__ I just saw a red van pulling into the driveway . Is that her ? __eou__
B , what's in your hand ? __eou__ Sunday papers . I usually read them after coming back home from our company . __eou__ Why do you read them ? __eou__ As you know , I am a sports fan . And these papers are famous for their sports section . So I will feel relaxed after grasping some information I am interested in . __eou__ I got your meaning . Reading is your own solution to solve pressure from busy tasks . __eou__ Correct ! What about you , Fred ? __eou__ I often go to the bar near our dorm when I am overtired . I am crazy for drinking wines with special taste . __eou__ Don't overdo it . __eou__ Shall we have a drink someday ? __eou__ I get drunk easily . __eou__
What a lovely day , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it's nice and bright . __eou__ I hope it stays like this . __eou__ I hope so too . __eou__ Is the weather usually like this here ? __eou__ It's usually a bit hotter than today . __eou__ What's the weather like in winter ? __eou__ It's pretty cold and it often snows . __eou__ I wonder what it ’ s going to be like tomorrow . __eou__ Let's hear the weather report later . What's the weather like in your hometown ? __eou__ Neither too cold , nor too hot . __eou__ That's quite a lovely weather . __eou__ Yes , especially in spring . __eou__ Have you ever seen a hurricane ? __eou__ Once , when I was a child . __eou__ Do they often happen in your country ? __eou__ Now and then . __eou__ Oh , it's time for the weather reporter . Let's turn on the TV . __eou__
Are you travelling in America ? __eou__ No , I am on business . I will spend half a month for the business . __eou__ What do you do ? __eou__ I am currently working in a foreign company as a salesman . __eou__ I know all the tricks of the trade . It is quite tiring and difficult to be promoted . __eou__ Maybe . But it provides much wider space for me to improve the skills and increase the experience . What about you ? __eou__ I am a reporter at a TV station . __eou__ Do you like your job ? __eou__ Yes , I have good working conditions and I would require a salary at least 15 , 000 $ a year . __eou__ Which kind of news do you catch ? __eou__ I report the social news which means I always interview the citizens of various professions and trades . __eou__ Are you feel tired ? __eou__ Sometimes . News happened out of expectation . Sometimes I have to get up in the early morning while I can't sleep for editing and interviewing . __eou__ You have to experience this if you want to be an extraordinary reporter . __eou__ That's right . I am still wet behind the ears . __eou__
What a charming room ! It faces south , and there's such a lovely view of the city . __eou__ I'm glad you like it.The bell is on the bedside.Just ring if you want anything.The room attendant speaks a little English.So I don't think you'll have any trouble . __eou__ No , I shouldn't think so.By the way , is there a socket for my razor ? __eou__ I think so.Here it is.It ' s by the basin . __eou__ Is it a two-pin socket ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ Good , I ' Ve get a two-pin plug . __eou__
You're my hero . __eou__ Aw , shucks , ma'am . __eou__
That's brilliant ! We can name the grades of motor oil by where they come from . __eou__ Mr . Mechanic , I'd like a nice Venezuelan blend this morning . __eou__ I think the Saudi Arabian will hit the spot today . __eou__ But really , maybe this can work . Everyone loves coffee , and everyone needs motor oil . __eou__ A match made in heaven . __eou__
What ’ s your city like ? __eou__ It ’ s quite an interesting place to live . The best thing to do in my city is go shopping . There are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls . __eou__ Is the traffic bad in the city centre ? __eou__ Not really . Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . The public transport system is pretty good . __eou__ What about restaurants and entertainment ? __eou__ There are restaurants with food from all over the world . We have a small china-town near the city centre . There are many Indian , thai , and Italian restaurants all over the city centre . There are many s __eou__ Is there a lot of nightlife in your city ? __eou__ There are several good clubs near the city centre . Many people in my city prefer something more cultural , so we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas . __eou__ It sounds like a really exciting city to live in . __eou__ It is . I hope you ’ ll have time to come for a visit soon . You really should come during the summer , when the weather is better and there ’ s more happening outdoors . __eou__
Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ? __eou__ I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table . __eou__ you have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China . __eou__ I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick . __eou__ you lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you __eou__ a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood . __eou__ then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you . __eou__ I got you . Next time . I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway . __eou__
When ’ re you getting married ? __eou__ We planned our wedding for next May . __eou__ Why so late ? Didn ’ t she want to get married this October ? __eou__ Yeah , I did . But my fiancee has an important project . __eou__ That ’ s really a shame . By the way , who will be the bridesmaid ? __eou__ Julie ’ s friend , Mary . And John will be the best man . __eou__ Wow ! I ’ m very excited about your ceremony . __eou__
Good afternoon , Mrs . Brown . I've come to see Mr . Brown . __eou__ Good afternoon , Mr . Green . __eou__ Is he in ? __eou__ I'm sorry , but he's not in , he's gone out on business . __eou__ Oh ! I just drop in on him for a chat . __eou__ Please come in for a cup of coffee . __eou__ No , thank you . Please tell him to phone me when he comes back . __eou__
I heard the film was after the novel The Godfather . __eou__ Who wrote it ? __eou__ Mario Puku . __eou__ Who're the producer , the director , the stars , heroine and the hero ? __eou__ I'm always interested in how , but seldom pay much attention to who . __eou__
Going to the gym tonight , Mary ? __eou__ Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong . __eou__ That sounds like fun . Would you mind some company ? __eou__ I'd love it . Working out is more fun with a friend . __eou__ I'll get my things and meet you there . __eou__ Good . If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong . __eou__
You didn't show up to my performance last night ! Some kind of friend you are ! __eou__ Give me a chance to explain . I was no my way and I had an accident . __eou__ Sure . You look like you're all black and blue . __eou__ I am fine . In fact , I don't have a scratch on me or my vehicle . But the other guy is in critical condition . __eou__ You're serious ? __eou__ Yes , I'm serious . I'm really sorry about missing your concert . __eou__ I guess I misjudged you . I hope you can forgive me . __eou__ Of course I forgive you . What are friends for ? Now , what am I going to do for that other guy ? __eou__
The whether in Beijing is just beautiful . __eou__ Autumn is the best season in Beijing you know ? __eou__ Yes . I can see . The summer heat is over . And the winter cold is still far away . __eou__ What is the whether like in Washington at this time of this year ? __eou__ Autumn is also very nice In Washington . __eou__ Is it very cold in winter there ? __eou__ No . it isn ’ t .

I ’ m from the north . I was born in Beijing actually . __eou__ I see . So this is your hometown ? __eou__

Man , they take a lot of our paycheck . __eou__ Yeah , the government really takes a bit , doesn't it ? __eou__ Seriously . The only tax I don't mind them taking is social security . It's only a few dollars every paycheck . __eou__ Yeah , I don't mind it either . We ’ ll both end up rich slobs and not need it , but what if we do , you know ? __eou__ Yeah . It won't be much , but at least we ’ ll have a monthly check when we get old . __eou__ Yeah , my grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive . __eou__ Let's just hope the politicians don't figure out a way to spend it . __eou__ Really ? No , they couldn't . None of them would have jobs if they did . __eou__
Nick ! How ’ s it going ? __eou__ Oh , hey ... __eou__ What are you doing in this neighbourhood ? Do you live around here ? __eou__ Actually , my office is right around the corner . __eou__ It was great to meet you last week at the conference .

Is that a new restaurant or something ? __eou__ Nah , it's a place where homelesspeople go to eat . __eou__ How did you get involved in something like that ? __eou__ Well , the minister at my church told us about it , and it seemed interesting . I thought I'd try it once , and if I didn't like it I'd stop . __eou__ So what do you do there ? __eou__ It's simple . All we do is prepare some food , usually sandwiches and some fruit , and give it out to them at the soup kitchen . __eou__ Yeah , it sounds easy . How long does it take ? __eou__ Only about two hours , for a couple of days a month . Why don't you give it a try ? __eou__ I don't know . I mean , I like helping the community and all that , but I don't know if I have the time ... __eou__ Come on , it's easy , and it'll make you feel good . Why don't you come with me tonight ? __eou__

Man , I knew you weren ’ t listening to me . __eou__ You ’ re right . I wasn ’ t . I hear nothing . __eou__ Nothing ? __eou__ Not a sound on the city streets , just the beat of my own heart , I think that ’ s how it goes , something like that . __eou__ You and Patricia got engaged , didn ’ t you ? You can tell me . __eou__ Engaged ? __eou__ Come on . __eou__ Are you crazy ? __eou__ What ? I thought you liked Patricia . __eou__
I'll come see you tomorrow . __eou__ Promise ? __eou__

A friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . I was very interested . So I asked him to get me the application form .

I ’ Ve prepared some party games for the children too . __eou__ I ’ Ve brought a tape with lots of children ’ s songs on it . __eou__ Hopefully , that will keep everyone happy . __eou__

There is a new restaurant opening up in town next month . __eou__ What kind of food will they be serving ? __eou__ My favorite , Mexican .

I feel very hungry now . __eou__ Fine , I know a good hotpot place in the downtown area , food there is pretty spicy too . Shall we try that one ? __eou__ Ok with me . You are the boss . I will meet you downstairs after work . __eou__
Charlotte , have you had your supper ? __eou__ No , I don ’ t want to eat anything . __eou__ Why ? Don't you feel well ? __eou__ I ’ m down in spirits . __eou__ What's up ? __eou__ My manager jumped on me for my mistake today . __eou__ You must not feel depressed about such a trivial thing . __eou__ I think I'm too clumsy . I can do nothing well . __eou__ You'd better shape up if you want to get the job done . __eou__ But I doubt myself . __eou__ Cheer up ! Don't let me down . We all make mistakes , and that is life . __eou__
I'm afraid I can't go to the pictures with you tomorrow . __eou__ Busy with your work again ? __eou__ Not really . I'm expected to attend a meeting . __eou__ I'm not at all convinced . Tomorrow is Saturday ! __eou__

I'm so glad to meet you . __eou__ How is everything going on ? __eou__ Fine . __eou__ You look prettier than before . __eou__ Really ? Thank you . __eou__
You must be annoyed about your boyfriend ’ s leaving you , huh ? __eou__ Don ’ t ever mention him . I ’ m getting over it . __eou__ It ’ s a sad thing . I ’ m ever so sorry ... __eou__ Are you done ? __eou__
Hello , Rebecca , fancy meeting you here ! __eou__ Hi , Paul . I haven't seen you for a long time . __eou__ How have you been ? __eou__ Fine , thank you , and you ? __eou__ Pretty good . What brings you here ? __eou__ I came to see my uncle . He lives in the next block . __eou__
What courses are you going to take next year ? __eou__ Well , I am certainly going to take chemistry and physics , but I haven't decided on the other subjects yet . I'd like to take English . __eou__ Why are you going to take english with chemistry and physics ? __eou__ Because I want to study english literature . but I think chemistry is better for getting a job . __eou__ Of course it depends on what you are going to do when you leave college . Have you beside what you are going to do when you graduated ? __eou__ I am going to be a , well , I hope to be a research chemist . __eou__
Hi , chary , are you busy this evening ? __eou__ sorry , I'm afraid that I've got plans tonight . __eou__ what are you doing ? __eou__ I'm going to my parents ' house for my father's birthday . __eou__ how old is he today ? __eou__ it's his 50th birthday . __eou__ well , wish him a happy birthday for me . __eou__ sure thing .

It's about time I made a move . __eou__ say hello to your friends for me . __eou__ likewise . See you later . __eou__ Bye ! __eou__
Good afternoon ! __eou__ Hi , how are you doing ? __eou__ Fine , thanks . I am Wang Lin . __eou__ Glad to meet you , Wang Lin . I am Mary . __eou__ Is this your first time in Beijing ? __eou__ Yes . My company has an office here , and I have just been transferred . __eou__ Here is my phone number . If you need anyone to show you around , call me . __eou__ Great . I would like that . __eou__
Hey Michelle , jump in quick . It's pouring out there ! __eou__ Oh , hi Melissa . Are you going to the conference too ? I was planning to pick up Mr . Campbell . __eou__ Yes , he told me . We need to pick him up at his hotel and then go to the conference . __eou__ Oh I see , okay . So I heard you got married . Congratulations ! __eou__ Ah thank you ! I'm very excited . We were going to get married next year , but then we decided to get married on holiday instead . It was wonderful . __eou__ That sounds so romantic ! Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year , but we had to postpone our plans . We just don't have the money ! __eou__ I know what you mean . I think Shanghai is getting more and more expensive , don't you ? __eou__ I sure do . In my opinion , it's actually becoming more expensive than back home . __eou__ Definitely . Oh , there's Mr . Campbell . Driver , can you stop here please ? __eou__
What's that , a new video game ? __eou__ Nope ! It's the latest generation of PAD ! You won't believe what it can do . __eou__ For instance ? __eou__ It has a built-in camera unit that takes digital color stills . It also plays MP3 files , which I can save on media cards and then transfer to the hard drive of my computer . __eou__ Wow ! Anything else ? __eou__ This one comes with its own folding keyboard . It has a pre-installed handwriting recognition program . I can use the stylus to write on the screen . __eou__ What if I want to use CD-ROMs or floppies ? __eou__ Just plug in a peripheral CD or floppy drive and you're ready to go ! __eou__
Hey , what's up ? __eou__ Oh , nothing . __eou__ What were you writing ? __eou__ ( Laugh ) All right . You caught me in the act . I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out . I was just writing a note to put on her desk . __eou__ You mean you're going to ask her out in a note ? You big chicken ! __eou__ I admit it . I'm a wuss . I just can't do it in person . __eou__ But , you work with her everyday . __eou__ That's different . When I'm working , I'm in a different frame of mind . But , when I even think about asking her out , I get tongue-tied . At least in a note , I can get the words out without turning beet red . __eou__ You've dated a lot . What's so different about Diana ? __eou__ Well , for one thing , she's gorgeous . She's so upbeat and sweet . Who doesn't like her ? Oh , I don't know . All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together . But , what if I'm wrong . Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way . Oh ... forget it . This was a bad idea . __eou__ Well , I guess you don't want this note , then . __eou__ What note ? __eou__ I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana . She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night . __eou__ You're kidding ! I can't believe you've been standing this entire time and didn't say anything . __eou__ Sorry . What can I say ? Now , do you want the note or what ? __eou__ Yeah , I want the note . __eou__ Have a great time tomorrow night . __eou__ Thanks . I plan on it . __eou__
So , what happened ? __eou__ He never came . __eou__ He stood you up . __eou__ I wouldn ’ t exactly characterize it in that way . I think something happened . Something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him to ... what if he showed up , took one look at me and left ? __eou__ Not possible . __eou__ Maybe , there was a subway accident . __eou__ Absolutely . __eou__ A train got trapped underground with him inside . __eou__ And no phone . __eou__ And you know , how those express trains create suction . __eou__
Mary , how was your date with john ? __eou__ It's OK . It seems we have a lot in common . __eou__ Oh , really ? That is great news . What does he look like ? __eou__ He is tall and slim , fair-haired . __eou__ Sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? __eou__ He is a nice guy and very considerate . I am impressed with how smart he is and he has a great sense of humor . __eou__ Oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ? __eou__ He didn't say , but he said he would call me . __eou__ Maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much ! __eou__ Oh , David . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What should I do if he doesn't call me ? __eou__ Come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry . __eou__ Thank you , David . You're always so encouraging . __eou__ That's what friends are for . __eou__
I feel terrible , but I've just broken your ashtray . __eou__ It's nothing to get upset about . __eou__ I don't know what to say . I'd like to replace it . __eou__ No . It's out of the question . __eou__
I'm so angry at Bob for buying a new bike . __eou__ What's the big deal ? __eou__
The hotel is full tonight . we will need to find a new place to stay . __eou__ Maybe it's just a blessing in disguise . I've been wanting to try a new place anyway . __eou__
Do you know much about computers ? __eou__ Not a great deal . __eou__ I've just been reading an article about them.they ' ll be used for all sorts of things now . __eou__ For accounting system and things like that , you mean ? __eou__ Yes , but they are used for other things , too.Do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to Paris . __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ The man asked where we want to go , then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply . A few moment later , he gave us two tickets . __eou__ Of course , his machine must have been connected to a computer . __eou__ That's right . __eou__
How happy you are ! Next Monday is your wedding day . Congratulations ! __eou__ Thank you ! __eou__ Fred is really a good guy . And he loves you so much . __eou__ Yeah . I'm lucky to be his wife . __eou__ He's after your own heart , it is important . __eou__ So he will make a perfect husband . Make sure you will be here next Monday . __eou__ I promise ! __eou__
Many happy returns of the day , darling ? __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ And here is your birthday present . __eou__ A gold watch ! __eou__ Do you like it ? __eou__ I love it ! Darling , you ’ re kind . __eou__
I didn't expect to see you at this hour . You must have goofed off again . __eou__ Goofed off ? Maybe , but I'm not a clock-watcher . I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier . __eou__ You'll be sorry if the boss finds it out . He may probably give you the bag . __eou__ I'm sure of what I'm doing . __eou__
Hi Jane , you look great . __eou__ You too . Have you lost some weight ? __eou__ Yes , I took off 4 kilos . I am glad you notice it . __eou__ Not some crazy diet fat I hope . __eou__ No no , I just changed my eating habits . I eat a balance meal . and I eat less than before . __eou__ Good for you , keep it up . __eou__
On balance , dress designing appeals to me most . __eou__ Yes , it's to my liking , too . __eou__ Say , how would you like to be a dress designer ? __eou__ It's my dream . __eou__
Hi , Sue . What's up ? __eou__ Hey , Andrew . How's everything with work ? __eou__ Ok , I guess . My boss has been on my back recently . __eou__ Really ? What's he been doing ? __eou__ You know , just giving me lots to do . I'm really busy right now . __eou__ Are you ? What are you busy with ? __eou__ Oh , lots of things . Mostly training new people . __eou__
OK , that ’ s fine . Bye . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ That ’ s it , my lease is up . I have to move . __eou__ What ? Why ? Can ’ t you renew it ? __eou__ The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot __eou__ Well , I can help you pack . We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP . __eou__ I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something . You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here . I ’ m gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while . __eou__ Well , let me know if there ’ s anything I can do to help out . __eou__ Actually , would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks ? __eou__ Hehe .. sure __eou__
Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ? __eou__ I think housing is a big problem . There are thousands of homeless people on the streets . __eou__ How would you solve the problem ? __eou__ I have a good idea to solve it . The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes . __eou__ It would probably be very expensive . __eou__ I think the government can afford it . Besides , there are many advantages . Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement . __eou__ It ’ s not a bad idea . I think education is the biggest problem at the moment . Schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly . __eou__ If we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . That wouldn ’ t be popular with voters . __eou__ Most voters what everything bout ways . They want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes . __eou__ The government should show that it is using money efficiently . Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project . __eou__ Yes . The government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly . __eou__
The sun is shining . __eou__ But there're some mare's tails . __eou__ That's the sign of wind . __eou__ Oh , really , I thought it was a sign of rain . __eou__
Hello , Joanna . You are looking very charming in the new dress . __eou__ Thanks . Does it suit me ? __eou__ Yes , it suits you very well . It certainly is unique . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve seen anything like it before . __eou__ I know . That ’ s why I bought it . I hate wearing the same styles like everybody else is wearing . __eou__ And the necklace , it matches your dress marvelously . __eou__ It ’ s very nice of you to say so . I should say you are glamorous yourself , as a matter of fact . __eou__ Thank you for saying so . __eou__
Welcome back ! How was your vacation ? __eou__ It was fantastic , but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring ! __eou__ Where did you end up going ? __eou__ Because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to Paris , so we went there . __eou__ I've always wanted to go to Paris . The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ? __eou__ That was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ? __eou__ Sure . What's this one a picture of ? __eou__ Oh , that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city . __eou__ You don't look very happy in that picture . __eou__ No , by that time , I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces ! __eou__ So what did you do ? __eou__ We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel . __eou__ My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ? __eou__ Of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though . __eou__ That's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day . __eou__
Your ring is very beautiful . __eou__ Thank you . It has been handed down in my family for three generations . __eou__ Oh , it is precious . __eou__ It surely is . __eou__
Our major is from a bigger city . __eou__ He ’ s doing fine . A new broom sweeps clean . __eou__ He brings with him some talented people from his former city . __eou__ I think we ’ ll benefit a lot . __eou__
Hey , where's Cindy ? __eou__ She told me that she's got tennis practice today . __eou__ You're Mary , right ? __eou__ How did you know ? __eou__ Cindy told me about you in our gym class . __eou__ I see . Do you live in this neighborhood , too ? __eou__ My house is next door to yours . __eou__ Oh , Cindy did mention you before . You're Alexander Newman . __eou__ Just call me Alex . Alex and Alexander are the same thing . __eou__
What's the score ? __eou__ The Ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half . __eou__ The Russian team needs to tie the Ukraine to get the pass for the final . __eou__ It doesn't seem to be so easy . __eou__
I hear that there is a festival called Duanwu in China . __eou__ Yes . It is also called Dragon Boat Festival . __eou__ Why are you celebrating this festival ? __eou__ We celebrate it to commemorate a great patriotic poet of China — Qu Yuan . __eou__ What do you do on that day ? __eou__ We'll have rice dumplings . What's more , there are also dragon boat matches in some places of southern China . __eou__ I see . __eou__
Hey , there's Leo . I wonder why he's walking arm in arm with that young woman . __eou__ It's as plain as the nose on your face . They're dating each other . __eou__ You're pulling my leg ! She must be thirty years younger than Leo . Talk about robbing the cradle ! __eou__ Well , you can bet this relationship's going to be a flash in the pan . __eou__ It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn't have a girlfriend last week . __eou__ I think you are absolutely right . Actually , my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . They got married a month later . __eou__
How many credits are you taking this semester ? __eou__ I have to have at least eighteen to keep my scholarships and grant . But so far , I only have fifteen . __eou__ What's the matter , are the classes you want full ? __eou__ Yes . And now I'm down to either taking a class I'm not going to need or considering a double major . __eou__ If you were to take on a double major , what would be your first choice ? __eou__ I think with International Business a language would be appropriate . __eou__ Have you even thought that far ahead ? I mean what country would you like to do business with ? __eou__ As a matter of fact , I would like to work in South America . So some Latin language like Spanish or Portuguese would work . __eou__
What part did you get in the play this time ? __eou__ I got a character part — some old lady who shows up in a few scenes . __eou__ I wish I had a character part . Those are my favorite . __eou__ Are you kidding ? You got the leading role . __eou__ I know , but I've done that so Ay times . It's getting old . The leading guy is always the same macho A . __eou__ I would trade you if I could but I don't think I'd be a very convincing macho A . __eou__ Next time . You are going to love your part . I've seen the script . __eou__ I do a good old lady . I wouldn't mind being the damsel in distress once in a while . __eou__
Are you free on Friday evening because we were wondering if you would like to come round for dinner ? __eou__ Oh , thank you very much .

I ’ Ve got a lot going on the next couple of weeks . Why don ’ t I call you later ? __eou__ Okay , that ’ s fine . __eou__
Which season do you like best ? __eou__ I like spring best . It is neither too cold nor too hot . Freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . How about you ? __eou__ I prefer summer , especially the summer evenings . When the sun comes down , it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . After a rain shower , the smell of the air is refreshing . It is also a best reason for ice-cream . __eou__ How do you get through the stuffy daytime ? __eou__ Well , I have to hide in the air-conditioned rooms . Anyway , it is all worth , just think about the cool evening time . __eou__
Great party , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah , really , jane and ted always have great parties . __eou__ This is my first , I only met jane last week . she and I teach at the same school . __eou__ Oh , so you're a teacher . __eou__ Yeah , history , what about you ? __eou__ I'm in the car business . __eou__ Salesman ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . __eou__ Oh , I see , by the way , my name's Mary . __eou__ Nice to meet you , I'm jim taylor . __eou__

Quickly ! __eou__ So , since when is your house a bank ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I mean , what ’ s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows . __eou__ Security , Dan , security ! You can never be too safe you know ! A lot of sickos out there . Just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed ! Had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window . __eou__ What ’ s the matter with you ? Why are you acting all paranoid ? __eou__ Paranoid ? I ’ m not paranoid ! I ’ m cautious ! You see Dan , we have to be on guard at all time ! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you ! Telemarketers , solicitors , even your bank ! They have way too much information ! I like to keep everything on a need to know basis . __eou__ OK , well , what did you want to see me about ? __eou__ You are being watched ! Be careful Dan ! Be careful ! __eou__
You didn't ring me last night.You said you would . __eou__ I'm sorry to have made you disappointed . __eou__ That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . __eou__ Was I ? Sorry , I didn'y mean to be . I do apologize . __eou__ And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? __eou__ Forgive me darling . I'm very tired . __eou__
Hey ! What's up ? __eou__ Hi , John ! I haven't seen you for ages . __eou__ Yeah , I've been out of town . __eou__ So how have you been ? __eou__ Great ! Work is really busy now , but it's fun . __eou__
Hey , let's go to the night market after work tonight . __eou__ That's a good idea . I haven't been in a while and I need to get a new backpack . The old one is hanging on by a thread ! __eou__ That reminds me I should buy some new socks to go hiking this weekend . __eou__
Reciting texts really bores me to death . __eou__ Do you have to remember every text ? __eou__ Yes , the teacher says recitation is real good . __eou__
Good Lord ! Look at that man . __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ He's swimming in the cold sea . He must be very strong . __eou__ Sure he is . Winter swimming does good to health , I hear . __eou__
How about a movie tonight ? __eou__ It doesn't matter to me . __eou__ Does 7 o'clock suit you ? __eou__ Either way . I don't care . __eou__ How about a snack after work ? __eou__ I couldn't careless . __eou__ Would you rather stay home ? __eou__ Whatever you say . __eou__ Are you really interested in doing something ? __eou__ I don't mind if you want to . __eou__
Have you bought another handset __eou__ No , it is the original one . __eou__ This is silver gray , while I remember your handset was black . __eou__ I have changed a case for it . __eou__ Can a handset case be changed ? __eou__ Of course . That's why I bought this type . I can change its case frequently , so it is novel to use it . __eou__ How many cases are accessible ? __eou__ There are two more , one is orange and the other is pink . I have bought them all . __eou__ It's really going to be fresh all the time . __eou__
Would you mind going to dinner with me tonight ? __eou__ I'd love to go out with you , but I'm sorry I'm busy tonight , but I'd like a rain check . __eou__ OK . __eou__
I want to change my job . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Well , I want to earn more . __eou__ I see . __eou__ Not only that . The job I ’ m doing now is the most boring job you can imagine . __eou__
It's very cold tonight ! __eou__ Can I get you another blanket ? __eou__ 0h , that would be nice of you . __eou__ I'll turn the heat up . __eou__ Yes , please do that . __eou__
Do bullfights interest you much ? __eou__ Absolutely ! Everything that ’ s thrilling turns me on . __eou__ So I ’ Ve got two tickets to the latest show but I need a little favor from you . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__
There is a wonderful opera today . I'd like to see it . __eou__ I do not like the play with complicated plot . What's on today ? __eou__ ' The sound of music ' . This music is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages . It is about a happy family without sex , violence or bad language . __eou__ I know that . I have seen the film as the same title . Andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime from Maria to a cheerful governess . __eou__ Yes , you are right . I like the song in the movie , edelweiss , do you remember it ? __eou__ Of course , it is a nice song that can make audience calm and pleasant . __eou__ Those young actors play the roles perfectly . __eou__ I hope the opera will be more stupendous than the movie . Have you bought the tickets ? __eou__ No , I am asking you whether you will go to see it . __eou__ Let's go . We'd better buy the tickets earlier and have dinner in restaurant . __eou__
Would you like to come out with me tonight ? __eou__ Sorry , I can ’ t . __eou__ Tomorrow night , then ? __eou__ I ’ d like to . But I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . __eou__ I ’ m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then . __eou__ That ’ s sounds great . __eou__ Ok . How about give me a ring , then ? __eou__ No . I ’ d better not . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Because I don ’ t think my husband would like it . Thank you for inviting me anyway . __eou__
You look like a basket case . __eou__ I'm not surprised . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ My brother in-law just dropped in from the states . __eou__ Yeah , and ? __eou__ I decided to put him up while he's here , big mistake ! __eou__ Why ? __eou__ He's lazy . I tried being a good host , but if you give him an inch , he'll take a mile . __eou__ I guess you think twice next time he comes . __eou__ You can say that again . __eou__ So how long has he here for ? __eou__ Two weeks . If he thinks I'll put up with his attitude that long he's got another thing coming . __eou__ Well , I know you do the right thing . __eou__
Hi , Mrs . Henderson . __eou__ Hi , Steven . Do you have time and chat with me ? __eou__ Of course I have plenty of time . What's new ? __eou__ The new couple next door divorced . Have you heard about it ? __eou__ No . The Hills ? Who filed for divorce first ? __eou__ I guess it Is Mrs Hill . She sued for divorce on the grounds of her husband's misconduct with his secretary . __eou__ Oh , maybe not . It's just your guess . Do not give currency to idle gossip . __eou__ OK . I close my mouth . __eou__
What's up , buddy ? You look so upset . __eou__ I just broke up with a girl . Why didn't she understand that I loved her ? __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . What's your conflict ? __eou__ I don't know . She always said I didn't love her , but I did . __eou__ Did you think about talking to her again ? Maybe she is waiting for your call . __eou__ I have asked for a talk again , but she refused and said she wanted to be quiet . __eou__ Come on , guy . Maybe she isn't your right person . __eou__
I like your sweater . It suits you very well . __eou__ Thank you for saying that . It's a present from my girlfriend . __eou__ She certainly has the taste . __eou__
Mr . : There are two things that you'll need to know . __eou__ What are they ? __eou__ Mr . : The school has three lunch periods , and the kids are divided into three groups to go to lunch . __eou__ Wow ! __eou__ Mr . : Furthermore , when you are dismissed in the afternoon , you will be divided into two waves . __eou__ Two waves ? __eou__ Mr . : The school parking lot is not big enough for all the school buses to come in at one time . So only half the buses come in first to pick up the first wave's students . __eou__ And the other half come in later to pick up the second wave . __eou__
Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! __eou__ What ? What did you buy ? __eou__ It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! __eou__ What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? __eou__ There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . __eou__ And ? __eou__ So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . __eou__ And it's a brick ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? __eou__ I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . __eou__ So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . __eou__ Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . __eou__ But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? __eou__ He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . __eou__ Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! __eou__ C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . __eou__ That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . __eou__ You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? __eou__
I'm sorry for being late . __eou__ You're supposed to stand here quietly until the flag - raising ceremony is over . __eou__ About what time can I go to my own class ? __eou__ When everything is over . __eou__ Now that it is all over . can I go now ? __eou__ Not yet . You should stand still for another few minutes . Late-comers must be recorded . __eou__ That's too bad ! __eou__
Are you looking forward to seeing that big concert next week ? __eou__ You bet . I'm really excited . __eou__
Hey Joanne . What are you up to ? __eou__ I'm just watching some television . __eou__ I'm so bored . I don't know what I'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning . __eou__ Me too . Do you think we are boring people ? __eou__ I don't think we are boring . It's just that we don't have any hobbies . __eou__ That's right . What do you think we should do as a hobby ? __eou__ That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings . __eou__ I like to play the piano for fun . __eou__ Yeah . That can be a good hobby . __eou__ Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do . __eou__ That's a great idea . I'm going to do the same . __eou__
Have you had any kind of punishment in your college ? __eou__ Yes , but it was many years ago . __eou__ What was it for ? __eou__ I was a naughty boy and I played hooky . So the school gave me a punishment to clear the classroom for a week . __eou__
How do you like my new sports car ? __eou__ It's cool . __eou__
If I won the Pools , I'd go round the world . __eou__ Would you ? I wouldn't . __eou__ What would you do ? __eou__ Oh , I don't know . I'd buy a big house with a garden for my wife and kids , I suppose . But it's difficult to imagine having a lot of money . __eou__ One thing's certain . If I had a lot of money , I wouldn't work any more . __eou__ Wouldn't you ? What would you do with all that spare time ? __eou__ As I said , I'd go round the world . __eou__ What would you do after that ? __eou__ Oh , I don't know . It'd take me a long time to go round the world . __eou__ It doesn't sound very exciting . __eou__ Anyway , we haven't won the Pools , and we're not likely to win them . So there isn't much point in talking about it , is there ? __eou__ I'd be happy if I got a rise . __eou__ And my wife would be happy if I bought her a mink coat . __eou__ Well , I'm not likely to get a rise and you haven't the money for a mink coat , so let's come down to earth and have another drink . __eou__ What'll you have ? __eou__ I'll have a pint of the best . __eou__ I'd have a Scotch if I were you . We deserve it . __eou__ All right . Make it a double , will you ? __eou__
do you like animals ? I really like dogs . __eou__ so do i . I don ’ t like cats . __eou__ why ? I think cats are ok . __eou__ I can ’ t bear being near cats . They don ’ t seem to like me either . __eou__ I like wild animals . I don ’ t like spiders and snakes . I think spiders and snakes are disgusting . __eou__ I ’ m fond of snakes . I think they ’ re great . I agree with you about spiders though . I think spiders are horrible . I think it ’ s because they have so many legs . __eou__ I think bears are wonderful . Pandas are fantastic . I low the people who kill them for their fur . __eou__ I agree . I ’ m carry about mice . I think they ’ re so cute ! __eou__ really ? I don ’ t see the attraction . I ’ m afraid of mice . __eou__
I hear your sister has had an accident , is it true ? __eou__ Yeah , it happened a week ago . __eou__ That's a crying shame . It really is ! __eou__ Fortunately , she's not seriously injured . __eou__
Good evening , I'm so happy you could come . __eou__ Thank you for inviting me . __eou__ What would you like to drink ? __eou__ A glass of white wine would be fine , thank you . __eou__
My son is alway complaining that I dump on him . He was very rude and told me to mind my own business . I cannot put up with that . __eou__ What does his dad say ? __eou__ John is a peacemaker.He simply doesn ’ t bother.He says he should give him a free hand . __eou__
Do you think children watch too much Tv ? __eou__ I only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . I don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids . I think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes . __eou__ Perhaps I should impose a limit on how much Tv my kids can watch . They don ’ t do much else in their free time . At least they always do their homework first . __eou__ If you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch , remember to have something else for them to do . If you don ’ t , they ’ ll get bored and misbehave . __eou__ They could go out and play with their friends . __eou__ Sure . You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time . __eou__ Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . He watches too much Tv too . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . Remember that if the parents watch too much Tv , the kids will probably follow suit . __eou__
Did you meet the new girl in our sales department . She is taking the place of Maggie during her alternative leave . __eou__ Did they finally fill that post , how come I haven't seen her ? She must have not been inducted yet . __eou__ I guess not , They haven't officially introduced her to the whole staff yet , she barely started yesterday . __eou__ Is she just working temporarily ? What are they going to do when Maggie comes back from leave . __eou__ If the new girl is competent , maybe they will promote her when that time comes . __eou__
what's up ? __eou__ not much . I'm just trying to hook up to the internet . I'm having a few problems though . __eou__ what's wrong ? __eou__ I've got all the cords plugged in , but it appears that I'm offline . __eou__ Are you using dial-up or broadband ? __eou__ actually , I've got a wireless connection . __eou__ In that case , you need to turn on your airport . __eou__ I hook up to the Internet every day . I can't believe I didn't do that . __eou__ do you like ever chat online ? __eou__ No , but I'd like to . Do you have to pay to do instant messaging ? __eou__ Oh , no . You can register for free . Just go to the yahoo website and it will tell you how to do it . __eou__ what do you do if people want to talk to you online but you don't want to talk to them ? __eou__ well , you can always block them . When I don't feel like talking to certain people online , that's what I do . __eou__ what's your email address ? I'll add you to my contacts list . __eou__ it's aubreyinchina@yahoo.com . __eou__ cool . We can meet up in a chat room sometime or just chat online using messenger.thanks for your help . __eou__ don't mention it . __eou__
I ran into a glass door yesterday . __eou__ What a bone head ! Be careful next time . __eou__
You have been here for how long ? Four months now ? __eou__ Yeah , about . __eou__ Do you know Chinese better now ? __eou__ Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone . __eou__ Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere . __eou__ I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation . __eou__ A shouting match ? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it . __eou__ I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time . __eou__ Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us . __eou__ Yes , absolutely true . __eou__
That guy's manner really turns me off . __eou__ Yeah.He never stops asking questions . __eou__ Maybe he's abnormal . __eou__
Do you like our new history teacher ? __eou__ I'm fed up with his endless talking . __eou__ You can't say that ! He's a very knowledgeable person . __eou__ I can't see it . __eou__
Have you seen Harry ? __eou__ No . As far as I can remember he was supposed to be on a business trip to Lisbon . __eou__ Yes , but he was supposed to be back by now . __eou__ Maybe you'll call his home . __eou__
You spoken English is pretty good . Please tell me your experience in learning English . __eou__ Uh , I don't know what to say . What do you want to know ? __eou__ What's your method of learning ? __eou__ Let me think a minute . I think I always try to take every chance to practice . __eou__ What if there is no chance ? I mean what if you don't have a partner , what will you do ? __eou__ Well , I talk to myself . That is , I play one role first , than the other . __eou__ That's a good idea . You are really creative . __eou__
How's your new car ? __eou__ Perfect.Couldn ' t be better ! __eou__ You made a good choice , then ? __eou__ It's just what I wanted . __eou__ No regrets ? __eou__ I'm really pleased with it.Thanks . __eou__ I'm glad you're so happy . __eou__ It's super . __eou__
Now that you'recommending such enormous fees , producers , directors , movie-makers must see you in a completely different light . __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Then the standard that you set yourself originally must have changed . __eou__ Well , if that's the case , I don't mind breaking the image that they might have or the standards that they have . I can only do what I know , and live how I've lived all my life , because I'm a fairly stubborn person . __eou__ It seems to me that now you're famous . You've got to go out and be seen at the right places and go to the right parties . __eou__ I don't go to parties . The parties I go to are the barbecues I have in my house . Being seen in the right places is something that I don't believe in . I don't believe in going to events just for the sake I of being seen . __eou__ Then fans don't see you much in public places . __eou__ Yes . I have a very low-key life ; I have a great life . I love what I do and I love how I spend my time , which isn't in a public place . __eou__ A lot of people compare you to Julia Roberts . I wondered if there was anyone that you compare yourself to in Hollywood , that you've watched and thought , ' Well , they've got something I could use a little bit or could learn a little bit about . ' __eou__ I've never had one person that I'd idolized . The comparisons to Jul-ia Roberts are incredibly flattering . I don't really know who I would compare myself to . I'd like to be a combination of a lot of people . A little bit of everything , really . I haven't quite figured out where my strengths are yet , and I've definitely found my weaknesses . __eou__
When do children start school in your country ? __eou__ Normally at six . Before that , they spend several years in the kindergarten or pre-school education center . __eou__ But thats only in the cities , isnt it ? __eou__ Right . In the countryside , things are more complicated . __eou__ Can kids in the countryside get equally good benefits and education like those in the cities ? __eou__ It depends . In some poor , underdeveloped areas , children's education is a problem . Many kids cannot afford to go to school . __eou__
The baby is crying again . __eou__ Leave him alone , he ’ ll soon stop . __eou__ How can you do so ? Perhaps something is wrong with him . Let ’ s go and see him . __eou__ OK . Nothing serious . He just wants us to be with him . __eou__
Oh that ’ s a lovely necklace . __eou__ Thank you . My husband gave it to me . __eou__ Oh I didn ’ t know you were married . __eou__ Yes I am . I got married five years ago . __eou__ Oh I see . That ’ s nice . Did you meet your husband at work ? __eou__ No , we met at university . __eou__
Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice . __eou__ Yes , it is . Thanks . I ’ m just surfing on the internet . __eou__ Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ? __eou__ This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ’ m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee ! __eou__ That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ? __eou__ No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city . __eou__ So , what programs do you have on your laptop ? __eou__ I ’ Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs . __eou__ I know you are keen on photography . It ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at anytime ! __eou__ It ’ s wonderful , isn ’ t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I look recently ? __eou__
Nice and warm again , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Oh , it ’ s lovely . Think of the nasty weather we had last week . __eou__ How are you these days ? __eou__ Fine , thank you . And you ? __eou__ Fine today , though a bit under the weather last week . __eou__
What's happening in your life ? __eou__ Can you believe I'm going to America ? __eou__ That sounds great . __eou__ Yes , I'm really excited . __eou__
My wife is really a chatter box . It ’ s so boring . __eou__ I have an idea . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ You just turn a deaf ear when she talks . __eou__
You ’ re a wonderful person , Kathleen . __eou__ So are you . __eou__ And I ’ m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn ’ t truly worthy . __eou__ I feel exactly the same way as you . __eou__ Don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t say that . That , that makes it worse . __eou__ What ? You don ’ t love me ? Me , either . __eou__ You don ’ t love me ? __eou__ No . __eou__ But we ’ re so right for each other . __eou__ I know , I know . Well , is there some , is there someone else ? Oh , that woman on television , Sydney Ann . __eou__
My elder aunt feels like vomiting , she is pregnant . __eou__ She'd better drink plenty of hot water and lie in bed . __eou__ But she feels like having no appetite at all if she stays at home all day . __eou__ Don't worry . She will be all right . __eou__
Is this your umbrella , miss ? __eou__ Oh , yes , it is . Thank you . I was looking for it just now . __eou__ You look a bit familiar to me . I wonder if I have seen you somewhere before . __eou__ Have you ? __eou__ May I ask where you live ? __eou__ Just two blocks away , in that tall building . __eou__ That ’ s it . I live there , too . I live on the sixth floor . __eou__ My family move in just two weeks ago . We live on the fourth floor . __eou__ It ’ s a small world ! May I know your name , miss ? __eou__ I ’ m Chen Ming . __eou__ How do you do , Miss Chen ? I ’ m Song Mei . __eou__ I ’ m glad to meet you , Mr . Song . __eou__ Are you going to your office now , Miss Chen ? __eou__ No , I ’ m going to the airport to meet some friends from Beijing . __eou__
It's very thoughtful of you to invite me to your wedding . __eou__ How can I forget my old friend ? __eou__ My best wishes to you and the bride ! __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
I have a sweet tooth . I can not help but think about having something sweet between meals . __eou__ A new candy shop just opened around the corner last week . They have a variety of candies and it is always full of people . __eou__ That sounds really attractive . Let's go to that candy shop now . __eou__ Are you serious ? It is always crowded with many people . __eou__ why not ? I would like to buy some candies . Since there are so many people , I think they must have delicious candy . __eou__ Look at the candy bar over there . It is so colorful and tasty . __eou__ They have lollypops , chocolate drops , fruit candy , mints , pearbrittles and toffee . They are in different colors and flavors . __eou__ I want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything . __eou__ Me too . I finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people . __eou__ To be honest , I care only about whether I can have some delicious candy eat . I couldn't care less about whether the shop is popular or not . __eou__ You are a candy terminator . Be careful or you'll get a lot of cavities . __eou__ That is true . Speaking of cavities , I am starting to feel something is wrong with my teeth now . Let's get more strawberry chocolate drops before we go home . __eou__ You really can't live without candy . __eou__
Who do you think will win the championship ? __eou__ I really can't say . Both teams this year seem really good . __eou__ There's a game on tonight . You want to watch it with me ? __eou__ That sounds great ! __eou__
Good morning miss . Wang __eou__ Good morning Mr . Li __eou__ It ’ s a beautiful morning isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Oh . It ’ s a nice day indeed __eou__ I hope it won ’ t be too hot , I can ’ t stand the heat __eou__ Really . For me too . __eou__
You are very late , but I was on pins and needles the whole time . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry . __eou__
Look at these newlyweds . They seem as if they are on top of the world . __eou__ Yes , they do . It's great for them to tie the knot and get married . __eou__ People who have just got married feel that the world is right before them . __eou__ Nothing seems to be happier for them . __eou__
What would you say if I told you I was going to quit school ? __eou__ I ’ d say , think twice about it . Well , you are not going to quit school , are you ? __eou__ I don't know . I failed my exam . __eou__ What did you get ? __eou__ A B plus . __eou__ That's not bad . __eou__ But I should have aced it . I mean I finished the paper so quickly , thinking it's a piece of cake . But when I knew my result , I was like what ? That can't be true ! __eou__ Listen , John . I understand that you are such an excellent student and I know you must have lots of stress , but you really want to give up ? __eou__ No , I don't . I just don't know how to handle this . This is my first time , you know . __eou__ I know . Don't worry . Do you know what you should do ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ You need to blow off some steam . The world is not on your shoulder . __eou__ How ? __eou__ Forget about school and exams . Come over to my house and have fun . I have some really good DVDs . __eou__ Thanks . But I really don't feel like watching movies tonight . I have to get an early start in the morning . __eou__ Then go to bed and have a good sleep . __eou__ I guess that's what I need . Thanks . You're being a really good friend . __eou__ Of course I am . Well , pleasant dreams ! __eou__ Thanks , bye . __eou__
You are too picky . __eou__ No , I'm not.Hey , look at that guy over there . __eou__ Which guy ? __eou__ The guy in the blue shirt at the table by the window . __eou__ I can't see him . Where ? __eou__ Right there . __eou__ Oh , I see him now . Wait ! That's ... __eou__ Yes , it's Mel Gibson . __eou__ Oh , wow ! It's really him ! Who is that woman he's with ? __eou__ I don't know . Why don't you go ask for his autograph ? __eou__ I can't do that . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__
Do you have a family tradition at Christmas time ? __eou__ We have so Ay ! But my favorite happens at Christmas Eve . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Well , all the brothers and sisters get together and fill the Christmas stockings for the litt 1e kids . __eou__ That's it ? That's the tradition ? __eou__ Well , in fact it's fun for us to just be together that night and do this one thing . __eou__ I guess the spirit of it is what really makes any tradition fun . __eou__ You should be there some Christmas Eve . __eou__
Karen , do you have a minute ? I'd like to ask you about something . __eou__ Sure . What is it ? __eou__ I think you can give me some advice.You have worked here longer , and I just want to know what you think . __eou__ I'm glad to help you . But what is it you want to ask about ? __eou__ I am worried about the meeting this morning . __eou__ Why ? I think the meeting went well . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . But what are you worried about ? __eou__ I'm afraid I was too rude . __eou__ Rude ? You weren't rude at all , Annie . Why do you think you were rude ? __eou__ Well , I maybe talked to Mr . Drummond too directly . I thought I maybe said too much . I don't want him to be angry . __eou__ I understand . But really you weren't rude at all.You said what you thought . I think he appreciates that . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ But I am new here , and I'm not sure he is used to that . __eou__ You mean because you are a woman ? __eou__ Yes . And he is the president of the company . __eou__ Listen , Annie . You shouldn't worry about Mr . Drummond.He is a very good man to work for . He is not sexist at all.He appreciates people for their ideas.And he is willing to take suggestions from men or women . __eou__ I am very happy to hear that , Karen.It ' s good to know I'm working in such a company . __eou__ I agree with you on that , Annie . I've worked for Derek Drummond for nine years now . I feel he appreciates his employees for their work , not their gender . I would never change jobs . __eou__ Good . Thank you for telling me this . __eou__ Any time . If you have a good idea , don't be afraid to speak up.This is a company that appreciates initiative . __eou__
I really admire you , Diana . __eou__ why , Jerry ? Your words just came out of the blue . __eou__ you are really happy and able to achieve high scores at school . __eou__ I work very hard and that's it , you know , practice makes perfect . __eou__ isn't there anything else ? __eou__ I have no idea . __eou__ you must have a high IQ score . __eou__ well , Jerry , let me tell you a secret . __eou__ go ahead . __eou__ my IQ score is slightly above average . __eou__ seriously ? But you are such a genius . __eou__ maybe I've got a higher EQ . I'm not sure . __eou__ well , perhaps you're right . Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ . __eou__ you can say that again , Jerry . And I'm sure you're high in both of them . With a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks . __eou__ oh , thank you . I'm going to the library , are you coming ? __eou__ let's go ! __eou__
Hey Sarah . Why are you limping ? __eou__ Oh . Hi Matt . I went snowboarding yesterday and my whole body aches . __eou__ Was it your first time ? __eou__ Yeah . And I never want to go again . __eou__ I remember the first time I went . My back was sore , I couldn't sit down because it hurt my butt , and my legs would cramp if I walked too fast . __eou__ That's exactly how I feel now . __eou__ It's only like that the first couple of times . __eou__ Ha . There won't be a next time . __eou__ You gotta give it a chance . It's fun after awhile . __eou__ I'll think about it after I start feeling better . Right now , I don't even want to hear the word snowboarding . __eou__
Hi Mark . __eou__ Oh , hi Stacy . __eou__ How was your summer vacation ? __eou__ I worked over the summer at a restaurant . Have to make tuition money , right ? What did you do ? __eou__ I took summer school . I withdrew from two of my classes last year so I wanted to make them up . __eou__ So are you officially a junior now ? __eou__ Yeah . And I have 5 credits to spare . I only needed to take 10 credits over the summer , but I took 15 because the price was the same . __eou__ That makes sense . So where is Nicole ? __eou__ She dropped out of school completely . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ She worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well , they asked her if she wanted to work full time . __eou__ Wow . She's so lucky . She doesn't have a degree and she already has a job . __eou__ It sounds good now , but I'm traditional . I want the degree , so I wouldn't have accepted the offer . __eou__ Do you know how much they are paying her ? __eou__ I don't know . But I bet it must have been a good offer , or she wouldn't have accepted it . __eou__
What is up ? __eou__ Look at the dishes ! I have told you three times to put away these dishes . But now ... __eou__ Oh , don ’ t be angry . I just thought you might need them sometime . __eou__ I have told you that I don ’ t need them any more . The thing that really annoys me is that you played dumb with me . __eou__
Are you a smoker ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . __eou__ Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? __eou__ No . But my husband smokes 20 or more a day . __eou__ When did you begin to smoke ? __eou__ I had my first cigarette when I was 17 . __eou__ Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? __eou__ Yes . Twice . __eou__
Hey , look at my new shirt . What do you think about it ? __eou__ Just so-so . Where did you get it ? __eou__ I bought it on a street market . A real bargain ! __eou__ I'd much rather buy expensive but good quality clothing , because it is not only nice but lasts a long time . __eou__
Jenny , you look terrible . What's eating you ? __eou__ Don't brother me ! __eou__ Hey , chill out , I'm just trying to help . __eou__ Sorry , Sally , it's not your fault . __eou__ So , what's the problem ? __eou__ I drew a blank on the algebra test . __eou__ No kidding ! Didn't you study for it ? __eou__ Yeah , but nothing was clear during the test . __eou__ That's too bad , anyway , I'm sure things will turn around next semester . __eou__ I'm thinking of dropping out . __eou__ You can't do that , Jenny ! __eou__ I'm dead serious about this , Sally . __eou__ Come on , let's talk about it . __eou__
Lisa , I'm home . __eou__ How was your day ? __eou__ Pretty good . I've made a few friends already . __eou__ Anybody I know ? __eou__ Well , Pam Franklin lives next door to us . By the way , can I go to her house this Saturday ? __eou__ Of course . You didn't have to ask me . __eou__ That's what Pam said . __eou__ Just don't stay out too late . __eou__
It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah . The autumn is marvelous here . __eou__ How about winter ? __eou__ That's a hard time . The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy . __eou__ It's boring , right ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Do you get much rain during the summer ? __eou__ Plenty . We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area . __eou__ So you should bring an umbrella often . __eou__ That's right . __eou__
Thank you for coming to see me off . __eou__ Not at all . __eou__ If have time , I'll come again . __eou__ You're welcome at any time . __eou__ Thank you for your hospitality . I hope I didn't cause you too much trouble during my stay . __eou__ You're most welcome . __eou__ I'm afraid I have to go now . The plane will take off soon . __eou__ Call us as soon as you get home . __eou__
May I invite you to dance with me ? __eou__ Sorry , I can't dance . __eou__ Never mind , I can teach you . __eou__ Is it difficult to learn ? __eou__ No , it is easy . __eou__ How should I do ? __eou__ You just follow me . __eou__ All right . By the way , do you often dance ? __eou__ Yup , because dance can relax myself . __eou__ It seems a good way . __eou__
Hmm , what should I wear today ? __eou__ Come on , you think about what to wear almost every day . There are thousands of clothes in your wardrobe . __eou__ Well , haven't you ever heard people say that there is always one piece of clothes missing from a woman's wardrobe ? __eou__ I have and I can prove that is 100 % true for you . __eou__ Loving to look beautiful is women's nature . In fact , I am thinking about going to my favorite clothing shop today . __eou__ No kidding ! Again ? ! You just went shopping yesterday . You really are a shopaholic . __eou__ Well , I need to change the shoes I bought from Nasi . They are too small . I want to ask them whether they come in a larger size . __eou__ OK . Do you have the receipt with you ? I think they will ask you to show them the receipt first . __eou__
I'm feeling hungry . __eou__ Isn't it time for dinner ? __eou__ Yes , let's get something to eat . __eou__ How about Mac Donald's ? __eou__
What do you think of the way people use and treat animals ? __eou__ I think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . When we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor . __eou__ Perhaps people should stop eating animals . We could grow more crops . __eou__ What would you do with all the animals ? You couldn ’ t just let them go . Besides , some people would still hunt them . Meat has become an integral part of our diet . __eou__ We could provide them with better conditions anyway . We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible . __eou__ That ’ s true . I think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . I think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals . __eou__ I agree . I ’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo . I don ’ t like animals experiments though . I believe that we can do tests in other ways . __eou__ I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced . __eou__ That ’ s good news . The good thing is that most people treat their pets well . __eou__ Sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare . __eou__ Have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals . __eou__ Yes , I have . They do an excellent job . __eou__
I'll be seeing you around . __eou__ OK.Take care . __eou__
Did Bean send these dirty jokes to you , too ? Look ! __eou__ What a creep ! Phony good luck e-mails are one thing , but sexual harassment is crossing the line . __eou__ No wonder he asked for my address first-he just wants to harass me ! __eou__ You could try using a spam filter to reject stuff that's obviously pornographic or anything else you don't want . __eou__
Do you object to drinking black tea , Mr.Zhang ? __eou__ Yes , that is why I never drink it . __eou__ Do you drink green tea , then ? __eou__ Very seldom , because tea has tannin which may be harmful to one's health . __eou__ But if the tea is good and well prepared , it will do much good . __eou__ What good is it for ? __eou__ Not only can it appease one's thirst , but it can also refresh one when tired . __eou__ That's true , but it must not be allowed to stand long . __eou__ Why is it so ? __eou__ Because if you drink a kind of tea which has been prepared for some time before , it will do you harm . __eou__
I just heard your boy had taken the first place in the history test . He is super cool . __eou__ You flatter me . __eou__
Jennifer , would you like to have dinner with me ? __eou__ Yes . That would be nice . When do you want to go ? __eou__ Is today OK ? __eou__ Sorry , I can't go today . __eou__ How about tomorrow night ? __eou__ Ok . What time ? __eou__ Is 9:00 PM all right ? __eou__ I think that's too late . __eou__ Is 6:00 PM OK ? __eou__ Yes , that's good . Where would you like to go ? __eou__ The Italian restaurant on 5th street . __eou__ Oh , I don't like that Restaurant . I don't want to go there . __eou__ How about the Korean restaurant next to it ? __eou__ OK , I like that place . __eou__
Hi , long time no see . How have you been ? __eou__ Oh , I've been fine , but I'm having some trouble with my son . __eou__ Tell me all about it . __eou__ Oh , he's 14 and in the past few months , he's become quieter and a bit secretive . He locks himself in his room and I think he's running around with the wrong crowd . __eou__ Oh , I see . What makes you think that ? __eou__ Well , he's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band . And one night last weekend , he came home really late , way past his curfew . __eou__ Really ? What happened ? __eou__ He told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home . __eou__ I see what you mean . I understand why you're concerned . Have you tried talking to your son about it ? __eou__ I haven't yet . I just keep hoping it's just a phase he's going through . __eou__ You may be right , but it doesn't hurt to find out more about what's going on in his life . __eou__ You're right . I should talk to him . Sometimes , it's not easy being a parent . Thanks . It helps to get it off my chest . You're always so easy to talk to . __eou__ I don't know about that , but my door is always open . Stop by anytime . __eou__
Hello , Tom ! Do you have plans for this evening ? __eou__ Nothing special . __eou__ How about having dinner with me ? __eou__ That's great . I would love to .

Hello Mei , How about going for a meal this evening ? __eou__ Good idea ! I finish work at five . Why don ’ t we meet at six ? __eou__ Ok that sounds good .

I'd like to meet you again sometime . __eou__ That would be great . Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That's assuming you don't mind if I call you sometime . __eou__ Anytime . You can reach me at 5558929 . __eou__ Ok , got it . I will call you sometime next week . __eou__ Fine . __eou__ It's time to go . Bye , Ella . Hope to see you soon __eou__ Bye , Jason . __eou__
Lisa , I'm so glad to see you . How are you doing ? __eou__ Fine . I miss you so much , uncle Benjamin . __eou__ Me too . We haven't seen each other for years . __eou__ It's been 3 years now . __eou__ How time flies ! Now you are a college student out of a little girl . __eou__ How is aunty Shirley ? __eou__ Couldn't be better . __eou__ How has May been ? __eou__ She's been good . She is in grade one in Joy Chain high school . And she dreams to be a volunteer in 2008 . __eou__
When she told me that she would marry no man but Dick , my heart was almost in my mouth . __eou__ You were scared , too ? I dared not tell you my feeling when I heard that . I almost got fainted . __eou__ I could not and can ’ t make out the reason why she would set her heart on a man like Dick . He plays the field with many girls . __eou__ But Sarah says she does not care , so long as he loves her . __eou__
Excuse me . May I take a picture of you and your little boy ? __eou__ What ’ s it for ? __eou__ It ’ s for a book . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s a nice idea . Well , it ’ s fine if you take our picture . __eou__ Thank you . I appreciate your help . __eou__
Hey , That's a really nice outfit you have on . __eou__ Why , thank you . I wasn't sure if it looked okay or not . I can't believe all the words the salesgirl said . __eou__ Oh , you look stunning . Your dress really goes well with your shoes . __eou__ I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing . __eou__ No , not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ? __eou__ I got it on sale down at the department store . __eou__ When did you go there ? __eou__ I was just there a couple of days ago . You know , you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale . __eou__ I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ? __eou__ Anything you want . They have both casual and formal styles . __eou__ I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection . __eou__ That's a good idea . Some of your ties are pretty outdated . __eou__ Well , I spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor-made , so I couldn't afford to buy any new ties . __eou__ Anyways , are you going to the party tonight ? __eou__ Yes , I am . Say , are you going to wear that outfit to the party ? __eou__ I don't think so . It is a little too formal . I'm probably going to wear something more laid back . __eou__ Me too . I will probably go dressed in a T-shirt and jeans . __eou__ I guess that you will really be dressing down . __eou__ That's my style when I'm not in the office . __eou__ Good point . I suppose that we all have our own individual styles . __eou__

I am going to find a good company and invest in it soon . __eou__ It's a good idea . But please be careful when you invest this time . __eou__ Yes , I will . I should learn more from you .

Now I understand . But I don't smoke or drink.So what am I supposed to buy in here ? __eou__ You can buy some of these nice butterflies . __eou__ No , I'm sorry . I don't think it is nice to have butterflies mounted in boxes.It is kind of disgusting . __eou__ What ? You feel sorry for the butterflies ? __eou__ Yes . I think they should just let them fly free , and not try to sell them to foreigners . It is a kind of destruction of nature . __eou__ Well , I agree with you . I'd rather think that the butterflies are flying around in the mountains . I just wonder if they really catch so many that it affects the butterfly population . __eou__ Who knows ? Hey , I like these jade bears here . __eou__ How much are they ? __eou__ This one is 2300 dollars.Maybe I should buy it for my mother . What do you think ? __eou__ If you want . Didn't you buy her a small vase already ? __eou__ Yes , but she would like this a lot . She likes to collect little things like this . __eou__ Alright . Buy it then . I won't buy anything . Well , maybe I'll buy some Cognac . __eou__ Maybe I could buy some Cognac for my brother . He always drinks it . __eou__ Let's go ask about it . __eou__
What's new ? __eou__ Nothing much . __eou__
Hi , Monica , I got big news . __eou__ You got a raise ? __eou__ Not really , just take a wild guess . __eou__ You got promoted ? __eou__ Well , it is not going to happen so soon , I guess . __eou__ You won a lottery ?

I'm frustrated . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ I can't work out this problem . __eou__ Let me take a look . Maybe I can figure it out . __eou__ Thanks . I really appreciate it . __eou__
You ’ re a big fan of Andy Lau , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ Ve been got all his albums and most of his films on DVD . I adore him . He ’ s my idol . __eou__ How come you don ’ t have all of his films on DVD ? __eou__ Some of his early films are hard to find nowadays , especially the ones where he only played a bit part . __eou__ I see . I ’ m sure you ’ ll find them one day . I see you also have several poster of him . __eou__ Yes . These posters are new . I bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday . __eou__ Are you a member of his fan club ? __eou__ I was , but then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet , so I ’ m not a member now . __eou__ Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ? __eou__ Of course !

The art critic from the daily chronicle doesn ’ t think much of the max oreo exhibition . He says that the artwork is uninspiring and old fashioned . __eou__ Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . What did you think of it ? __eou__ I liked it . I didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion . __eou__ I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic . He doesn ’ t seem to like anything . Which kinds of paintings do you prefer ? __eou__ I like landscapes and still life . You prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I like painters who use will rather than watercolors . The colors appear richer . What do you think ? __eou__ I agree . I prefer oils too . I collect landscapes , but I only have a small collection . You have a small collection of abstract art , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . Good artwork is very expensive nowadays . When I was in china , I bought some calligraphy by famous artists . You should come and see it sometime . __eou__ That would be nice . Can you read the characters ? __eou__ I know what the characters on the paintings mean . I think Chinese characters look very artistic . It ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character . __eou__ I think that ’ s true with any of the fine arts . __eou__
Jenny , are you having fun here ? __eou__ Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines . __eou__ I ’ m glad you ’ re enjoying it . __eou__ Thank you for the invitation . __eou__ It ’ s my pleasure .

Hey , Tom , I want to learn how to play golf . __eou__ You're really sporty ! __eou__ I want to do everything I can . __eou__ Do you have clubs ? __eou__ No . Can I rent clubs ? __eou__ There are clubs for beginners . It's cheaper to buy those rather than rent them a few times . __eou__ What kinds of clubs ? __eou__ Like the seven-piece set . It's only $ 120 . __eou__ I'll buy a set . But you have to teach me . __eou__ Okay . __eou__
You are married to a foreigner , aren't you ? So what's it like ? __eou__ Well , in the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulties in getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts . __eou__ Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures . __eou__ Now we have a two-year-old boy . We're very happy that he's healthy and smart . __eou__ Oh , so he's half Chinese and half American . That's unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? __eou__ Right now he speaks mostly English , and he can say a few Chinese words . But he will learn in the future . __eou__ What does he look like ? Can people tell ? __eou__ Yes , people surely can . He's whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though . __eou__
What do you mean his grandmothers are already dead ? Wait a minute , you don't think he's avoiding me , do you ? __eou__ Well you know , claiming that your grandmother is sick is the classic excuse used to get out of doing something . __eou__ Oh man , I hate rejection . It really makes you feel terrible , especially when you really liked the person . __eou__ Is there anything I can do to help ? Just remember that I'm there for you if you want to talk about it . __eou__
How do you do , Mr.Smith ? This is Lili . I'm calling to thank you for the wonderful dinner we had yesterday . I enjoyed it very much . __eou__ You're welcome .

I am pleased to help you . __eou__ If there's anything that I can help you in the future , please let me know . __eou__ I'll do that.Thank you.Have a safe trip home . __eou__

I find it very informative.It always has plenty of articles from correspondents all over the world and the business section is very useful too . __eou__ Is there a Sunday edition of that newspaper ? __eou__ Yes . There is . it has several sections , so it ’ s quite a read ! It usually takes me a few hours to read it on Sunday morning . __eou__ What section does it have ? __eou__ Let me see .

They look at the most important stories in more detail . I find it fascinating . Do you buy a daily paper ? __eou__ I buy a national newspaper sometimes , buy I nearly always buy a local evening newspaper . I find the local news more interesting than national or international news . __eou__
You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator . __eou__ Ha , I am flattered . Actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works . __eou__ I am not good at it by any means . Give me some advice . __eou__ Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution . __eou__ Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down . __eou__ Ok , as John after Kennedy put it , let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate . __eou__
Hey , Shirley . The party has been wonderful . My husband and my children have enjoyed it very much , and me too . __eou__ I've said you will enjoy your life here ! __eou__ I surely will . By the way , is the party like this held every weekend in our neighborhood ? __eou__ Oh , I've forgotten to tell you . The party is held every other week . And every family gives their own performance each time . __eou__ My children would like that ; they like dancing very much . __eou__ That's good ! __eou__ Look ! Who is that guy on the stage ? __eou__ Oh , my God ! That's my husband , Benjamin . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ He likes American Idol very much , and he always imitates the contestant at home . I can't believe he got on the stage himself . __eou__ He performs very well . He is so funny ! __eou__ OK , just ignore him . I've noticed there are lots of exercise facilities in our community . After dinner you can go there for a walk with your family ! __eou__ OK , that's perfect ! By the way , is there any playground in our neighborhood ? __eou__ Yes , there is one behind our building . And you can play tennis there . But if you want to play tennis there , they will change you 30 Yuan per hour . __eou__ OK , got it ! Thank you so much . You have helped me a lot ! __eou__ You are welcome ! We are neighbors ! __eou__
You look pale , you must have poor health . __eou__ Yeah . You said it . __eou__ Why not go to see the doctor ? __eou__ I ’ Ve done that . The doctor advised me to cut out smoking and drinking . __eou__
How is Tom now ? __eou__ He's out of the hospital and up and about again at last . __eou__ Let's congratulate him on Sunday . __eou__
You said you like classical music very much . Then who is your favorite opera star ? __eou__ There are three of them , the Three Tenors . __eou__ Oh , you mean Pavarotti , Domingo and Carreras . Have you been to their live shows ? __eou__ Yeah , it's really a unique experience . It's a solo concert by Pavarotti . He put on the performance in the Forbidden City in Beijing . __eou__ I've heard of that one . It was also his swan song . __eou__ Besides , speaking of classical music , we should never forget about the New Year's Concert . __eou__ Of course not . People all over the world watch it on TV , or listen to it on the radio . __eou__ Sure . It's undoubtedly one of the biggest classical music events . Have you ever been to the live show ? __eou__ Yes , I went to the New Year's Concert in 2005 . __eou__ Wow , you are so lucky . I saw that one on TV . But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall . __eou__ That's for sure . You know , it's really amazing to be in the best concert hall , listening to the performance by the best orchestra . I had the greatest time ever . __eou__ Who was the conductor at that event ? __eou__ Lorin Maazel . He did an amazing job . Moreover , he just celebrated his 75th birthday . __eou__ So cool . I wish I can go to the live New Year's Concert someday in the future . __eou__ The right opportunity for you would come along soon . You know , music is transnational . __eou__ I believe in that . Well , the performance is about to begin . Let's be quiet . __eou__
I really need to find a parking spot . __eou__ Are you looking for a space on or off campus ? __eou__ Do you know any spaces on campus ? __eou__ You can park in the student parking structure . __eou__ Where is it located ? __eou__ You'll find the parking structure on the west side of the campus . __eou__ Do you have any idea if the parking structure has any spaces left ? __eou__ Last time I checked , it was pretty empty . __eou__ What time was it when you went up there ? __eou__ That was earlier this morning . __eou__ It wouldn't be full right now , would it ? __eou__ I have no idea . __eou__
Ok . Let ’ s look at our short presentation on China . What do we need to include ? __eou__ We need to talk about the size of the country and its population . __eou__ Ok . China is about the same size as Canada and the united states and it has a population of about 1.3 billion , making it the latest country in the world by population . __eou__ It says here that most of the people are han Chinese , but there are 55 minorities that make up almost 10 % of the population . __eou__ We need to say something about the geography and climate of china . Is there any way to divide the country into sections ? __eou__ We could divide into five parts . There ’ s the northeast , which is mild in summer and very cold in winter . Then there is the northwest , which is largely desert . Tillet is famous for its mountainous climate . The rest of the country can be roughly divided into two parts . One is temperate-mild in winter and warm in summer . Then , in the south it is hot most of the year . __eou__ That sounds very general . __eou__ It is , buy remember that we only have a few minutes to make our presentation . We can select cities from each part and give data for each one . __eou__ One from each part ? Lhasa , Urumqi , Harbin , shanghai , and hongkong . The capital city is Beijing , right ? __eou__ Yes . The other large cities are Chengdu , Dalian , Wuhan , tianjin , shenyang , Chongqing . Hongkong and Guangzhou . __eou__ We should take a large map and highlight those cities . What is each of them famous for ? __eou__
I learned of the railway accident only this morning . __eou__ A really dreadful accident and many people were killed . __eou__ Is that true ? __eou__ Yeah , well , I fill you in one the details later . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
Who is responsible for the accident ? Is it Tony ’ s fault ? __eou__ No . I don ’ t suppose he ’ s to blame . The man in the other car made a big mistake . __eou__ You mean Tony is the victim ? No , I don ’ t think so . He ’ s equally responsible because he tried to overtake you . __eou__ Yeah . I think everyone should go easy on driving . __eou__
Did you hear who won the English speech contest ? __eou__ No , who won ? __eou__ It's George . __eou__ Really ? I'm surprised . I didn't know his English was that good . __eou__
He's honest , hardworking and responsible . I simply can't find any shortcoming of his as an employee . __eou__ I rather doubt it.You ' re cheated by his appearance , I think . __eou__ Don't be so jealous . He never speaks ill of you before me . __eou__
Paul , let's go and see Grandpa this afternoon . __eou__ But Grandpa will be working . __eou__ It's Saturday . __eou__ I almost forget . __eou__

I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back . __eou__ Yeah but , it is something that you will have forever ! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . On top of all that , I have heard it hurts a lot ! __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Of course ! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink . __eou__ Oh , I didn ’ t know that ! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something . __eou__ I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . Also , find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles , and that the place is hygienic . __eou__ Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing ! __eou__
our company is going to do some cutbacks soon . __eou__ really ? Where did you hear that ? __eou__ I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ? __eou__ I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked . __eou__ no , it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is . __eou__ that's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her . __eou__ Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere . __eou__ well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael . __eou__ no , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family t __eou__ well , it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost b __eou__
Do you often surf the Internet ? __eou__ Yeah . I do it once a week . __eou__ Is it very interesting ? __eou__ Sure . I get a lot of information and make many friends . __eou__ Oh , I'll have a try . __eou__
I want to say ... __eou__ Say it ! What is it ? __eou__ That I can't go on any longer without you . __eou__ You know you shouldn't say that at a time like this . __eou__ Nancy , I made up my mind you were the only woman for me at the first sight . __eou__ Too sudden ! I'm not ready for it . __eou__ Forgive me for startling you with the impetuosity of my sentiments . __eou__ Stop it . No more of that talk . __eou__ I really love you . __eou__ No , I shall faint . __eou__ And I hope so . This is what you were meant for . Say you love me , say yes , say yes . __eou__ Yes . __eou__

Have you noticed the Mexican restaurant on the other side of this street ? __eou__ You mean the one with the yellow bricks ? But last time I saw it , it wasn ’ t really in business yet . I saw some people inside furnishing the rooms . Is it open now ? __eou__ Yes , someone give me a pamphlet introducing the restaurant and its business hours when I passed by this morning.So , let ’ s have a try . My treat . __eou__ Great , I like the idea of trying some new food . __eou__ Good for you . Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world . __eou__ Also some traditional Chinese food , like noodles and dumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality . I heard this year , the government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hygiene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control . __eou__ For sure all the customers will benefit from this . __eou__
You were right . It's raining again . __eou__ I told you so . __eou__

Are you best friends , too ? __eou__ We used to be really close , but that all changed once she moved to Shanghai . How about your family ? You didn ’ t mention to your biological father . __eou__ I don ’ t know much about him . He died when I was just a baby .

Does he keep in touch with her ? __eou__ No , she also died when my step-brother was little . My mother and my step-father met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . They ended up getting married a few years later . __eou__ Sounds like it was meant to be . __eou__
It's awfully quiet around here . __eou__ Yeah . There's nobody in sight . __eou__ I have a feeling that we're not supposed to be in here . __eou__ I think you're right . Let's go . __eou__

Table tennis is probably the most popular . __eou__ I expect all Chinese can play table tennis . __eou__ Most anyway . __eou__ Do you like playing table tennis ? __eou__ Yes , I like . But I can't play it well . __eou__ Are indoor sports popular ? __eou__ Basketball and swimming are very popular . __eou__ Really ? I like playing basketball , too . __eou__ We can play together if you are free . __eou__ That's great . __eou__

They are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries . __eou__ The coast of your country is very varied . The coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches . __eou__ That doesn ’ t sound too bad . Great for sunbathing ! The coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . There are cliffs , then sandy beaches . Then rocks . There are lots of caves in the cliffs . There are also many small islands off the coast , but few people lives on them . __eou__ There are many lakes and rivers in your country too . We also have many rivers , but only a few lakes . __eou__ We also have waterfalls in the mountains . They make the landscapes look very scenic . The landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion , especially by water . __eou__

Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . How could I do such a thing ? __eou__ Cheer up ! What I meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . There is no need to write a new one . Oh , what's this ? Is this your dissertation ? __eou__ Let me see . Yes , that's it . Where did you find it ? __eou__ You ’ Ve put it among these journals . __eou__ My poor memory . Thank you very much . __eou__

Are you stressed at all ? __eou__ well , I'm really worried about my grades . I didn't think this course would be so stressful . __eou__ you're a good student . I'm sure you can do well . What you need to do is to relax . __eou__ you're probably right . I just wish it were that simple . How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time ? __eou__ taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress . __eou__ I don't really have time to learn anything new . I need to spend my time studying ! __eou__ you need to take some breaks throughout the day . Studying all day isn ’ t very usually effective . __eou__ you ’ re right . I usually end up starting at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class . __eou__ besides , it ’ s not difficult to learn yoga . In fact , I can teach you a move that ’ s supposed to help you fall asleep ! You just have to sit down like this , bend over and breath in deeply . __eou__ that ’ s fantastic . I ’ m going to go try that out in my room now . good night ! __eou__ good night , sleep tight ; don ’ t let the bed bugs bite ! __eou__
Before we begin eating , I'd like to present everyone with a gift from Taiwan . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ It's a Taiwanese puppet doll . __eou__ It's huge ! __eou__ Yeah . They're usually this big . __eou__ The craftsmanship is excellent . __eou__ All the parts work . __eou__ Thank you so much . __eou__ Don't mention it . __eou__
Can I still get tickets for tonight's performance ? __eou__ The balcony is still available . __eou__ Aren't there any other seats ? __eou__ No , I'm afraid that's it . __eou__
It seems to me that you fall for good-looking guys . __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Why don't you date up a handsome guy and spend time together ? __eou__ I have found myself a date mate . __eou__ You must have a lot in common and a barrel of fun . __eou__ A barrel of fun , of course . He often says that I'm a date bait . __eou__
Would you like some coffee , Tom ? __eou__ Yes , thank you . __eou__ Here's some sugar . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
Espresso is made with a machine that forces steam and boiling water through finely ground coffee . It's strong . __eou__ OK , OK , this is good . Keep talking . What about cappuccino and all those other drinks ? __eou__ Cappuccino is one-third espresso and two-thirds a mixture of steamed milk and froth . __eou__ Froth ? __eou__ If you want something manly , stick with the espresso . __eou__ Thanks , Hugh . I owe you one . __eou__
What do you think of the speech the man delivered just now ? __eou__ Don't believe him.He ' s a liar . __eou__ We cannot expect politics to be true anyway . __eou__
Another weekend is coming ! __eou__ And we're going to have summer vacation . __eou__ Yes.What will you do this weekend ? __eou__ I'll plan for the vacation . __eou__
Hello , Tom . How do you find the dinner of yesterday ? __eou__ Very good . That may be the most delicious food I have ever eaten . __eou__ It's nice of you to say so . __eou__ I really appreciate you for having invited me . __eou__ Don't mention it . You know , we ’ re old friends . __eou__ Anyway , I owe you one . Are you free tonight ? __eou__ Yes . Why ? __eou__ I want to invite you to enjoy the food I cook . __eou__ That ’ s great . I'd love to . __eou__
Thank you for your letter . __eou__ Is your waist any better ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m feeling very well these days . __eou__ I ’ m glad you are getting better . __eou__ And I was glad to receive your letter . __eou__ Then when will you be back again ? __eou__ I will be back again next Wednesday . __eou__ I hope to see you at that time again . Bye . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
When I was a little boy , I had a dream of becoming a lawyer . __eou__ Your dream comes true now . __eou__ Yes , I knew I would make it . __eou__ You are really confident . __eou__
This is my uncle , Charles . __eou__ He looks strong.What does he do ? __eou__ He's a captain . __eou__ He must be very brave . __eou__ Exactly ! __eou__
How's your brother doing ? __eou__ As a matter of fact , he hasn't been feeling too well . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . What's the matter ? __eou__ Tell him I hope he's better soon . __eou__ I'll tell him . Thanks for asking about him . __eou__
Are you a soccer fan ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I like to watch soccer games on TV , but I don ’ t play . I watched every game of the 2002 World Cup . __eou__ Which team is your favorite ? __eou__ Italian . They played very well , but they were not very lucky . __eou__ I like the Brazilians . They are the real champions . __eou__
What are you doing , awake ? __eou__ I can't sleep ... __eou__ But it's almost midnight ! __eou__ Exactly . I'm too excited for Christmas morning . Also , I thought I heard Santa . __eou__ Really ? How do you know it was Santa ? __eou__ Well , I heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings , so I thought I'd be nice and make Santa cookies . I even left out some milk . I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies , so I came downstairs ! __eou__ Hmm ... well I know that Santa won't come down the chimney with you hiding behind the tree , spying on him ! __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Really ! Let's go back upstairs and get back to bed . That way , we can let Santa do his job . Then when you wake up , it will be Christmas already ! __eou__ O-K ... __eou__ Hey , honey ! Is that you ? Don't eat all the cookies — I want some , too ! __eou__
Hey Eve , how are you ? __eou__ I ’ m fine , Celia . And you ? __eou__ I ’ m ok . I ’ m so busy ! __eou__ Do you have a lot of homework ? __eou__ Yes . Don ’ t you ? __eou__ Of course I do ! __eou__ Which class are you working on right now ? __eou__ I ’ m studying for my chemistry exam tomorrow . __eou__ Are you in Mrs Green ’ s class ? __eou__ Yes . Are you ? __eou__ Yes . We must have the same exam tomorrow ! __eou__ Do you want to study together ? __eou__ Sure . This library is too quiet though . __eou__ Do you want to go to and empty classroom ? __eou__ That sounds good . __eou__ Ok . Let ’ s go ! __eou__
Are you ready to go the concert ? __eou__ Yes . Should we go there by bus so we aren't late ? __eou__ Actually , why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in rush hour . __eou__ That's true . Cycling is good for our environment , too . Let me just get my helmet then . __eou__ Is your helmet comfortable ? __eou__ Not really , but I liked the design , so I got it . __eou__ Maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better . __eou__ I'll think about it . __eou__ Is that your new bicycle ? __eou__ Yes , my father gave it to me for my birthday . Do you like it ? __eou__ It's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . These are really expensive ! __eou__ Nothing but the best from my dad . I like everything about it except for the brakes . They are a bit sticky . __eou__ I can fix those for you . Is there anything else wrong with it ? __eou__ Well , my saddle is too low for me . Do you know how to change the height ? __eou__ That's easy . It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle . __eou__ Is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike ? __eou__ It's possible . Give me a minute and I can fix these for you and then we can go . __eou__
Oh , God . It ’ s late . I ’ m afraid I have to leave . __eou__ But you just got here . Can ’ t you stay a little longer and have some tea ? __eou__ That ’ s very kind of you . But if I don ’ t go now I ’ ll miss the last bus . __eou__ That ’ s too bad . __eou__ Thank you for your hospitality . __eou__ Thanks for coming . __eou__ How about next time we meet at my place ? And I ’ ll treat you to Chinese food . I know how much you like it . We can order in and watch video too . Anything you like , I promise . __eou__ Great idea . I ’ m looking forward to it . See you then . __eou__ Well . I really do have to go . __eou__ Good night then . __eou__ See you tomorrow . __eou__
I'm going for a walk , Yi-jun . I need some time to myself . __eou__ Don't you want to go to the visiting hours ? This sheet says they are tonight . __eou__ I just can't right now . Everyone will be talking about Taylor and ... __eou__ ... and maybe that's what we both need . __eou__ I need to come to grips with his death first . And I also need to prepare a eulogy in case I'm asked to speak tomorrow . __eou__ OK , but don't forget I'm here for you , and I know how you feel . It's my loss , too . __eou__
You're going to get into a lot of trouble if you do that . __eou__ What makes you say that ? __eou__ I don't see anything wrong with what we're doing ! That's just the problem . In these kind of things , the trouble doesn't always appear at first . __eou__ But everything has been so easy . __eou__ Everything has gone as smooth as clockwork . Just like we planned ! That may be true , but if you were to do it , you would have trouble on the horizon . You always say that . __eou__ Yeah , you never look at the positive side of things . __eou__ Okay . Have it your way , but don't say I didn't warn you . __eou__
Write down your name here in ink . __eou__ But I don ’ t have a pen with me . May I use a pencil ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid a pencil won ’ t do . Wait a moment , I ’ ll find you one . __eou__
this party rocks ! __eou__ you said it . Good beer , good music , and on top of that , there are so many hot girls here ! __eou__ I'm with you on that . Check out that one over there . I think I'm in love ! __eou__ well , she's alright , but not really my cup of tea . What about the blond with the red dress ? __eou__ oh , that's Janice . She's just new in town . You have a thing for blonds , eh ? __eou__ yeah ! She could do anything she wants to me ! __eou__ I bet . Why not go over and talk to her ? She's really nice . __eou__ I don't think so . I get so nervous talking to girls . I always put my foot in my mouth , scare her off , and end up looking like a real fool . Besides , she is way out of my league . __eou__ come on ! Man up ! You'll never know until you try . __eou__ okay okay , just let me have another cup of beers to get my head in the game . __eou__ all right . But I think you ought to move soon . __eou__ why ? __eou__ I can see five other guys eying her up . __eou__ okay , here I go ! __eou__ good luck ! __eou__
Do you watch a lot of TV ? __eou__ Not really . I could take it or leave it . __eou__ Not me . I have to have my TV and watch whatever comes on . __eou__ How can you do that ? __eou__
I am certain I am going to fail my English test . __eou__ Why are you so pessimistic ? __eou__ Because it's impossible to improve listening level within a week . __eou__ Only for this reason ? __eou__ Yes , I think my vocabulary and reading comprehension are not very bad . __eou__ Don't worry about it . Practice makes perfect . I will lend you some listening materials , so that you can practise more before the exam . I believe you can pass the exam with good preparation . __eou__ Oh , thank you . That's very nice of you . __eou__
Hello ! So you are leaving today . __eou__ Hello . Thank you for seeing me off . You actually don't need to bother . __eou__ It is my pleasure to see you off . __eou__ Thanks a lot . I hope to see you again . __eou__ I hope so , too . __eou__ Thanks again for everything you have done for me . __eou__ You're welcome . Have a nice trip ! __eou__
Did you see the way that Brian came to work yesterday ? Ever since he came back from that conference in Silicon Valley , he's been coming to work dressed in jeans and sweatshirts . It's like he's decided to make himself at home in his office . I don't know how long it'll take before the management talks to him about it . __eou__ He was really influenced by the way they do things on the west coast . I guess the working atmosphere is a lot more relaxed and casual in California . It comes from the information technology industry .. there isn't such a large division between home and office , so people want to work in the clothes they feel more relaxed in . __eou__ Maybe so , but it seems kind of strange , which the rest of us in white shirts , dark suites , and ties . __eou__ It's not as bad as that ... We are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers . Besides , didn't you hear what Brian found on his desk this morning ? __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Management decided to give him four brand new white shirts . That's their way of telling him that his new style of dressing down is not quite acceptable . __eou__
I go to the fitness center every weekend . __eou__ What for ? __eou__ To lose some weight . __eou__ Why , you look pretty all right . __eou__
Uh-oh . I'm in trouble . __eou__ Why ? What's wrong ? __eou__ I just remembered that I've got to give a speech in class today and I forgot to prepare for it . __eou__ I guess you'll have to wing it . __eou__
I heard you received a prize for you book . __eou__ yes , I did . I won a prize for best local history book at the annual book awards . __eou__ congratulations ! You must be very proud of your achievement . __eou__ actually , I was happy just to get the book published . Winning the prize was an added bonus . __eou__ what was the prize ? __eou__ I won $ 200 to spend on any books of my choice . __eou__ that ’ s a great prize for a person who writes books ! Have you ever won a prize before ? __eou__ I shared a prize with some friends last week . We won a bottle of whisky at a pub quiz . __eou__ I won $ 10 in the lottery last month . Perhaps next time , I ’ ll be luckier and win the jackpot ! __eou__
To be frank , I find philosophy rather boring . __eou__ To tell you the truth , it's the most tedious course i have ever had . __eou__ How could you manage to pass the exam ? __eou__ It is still a mystery to me . __eou__
What date is it today ? __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Look at the girls in the street . They all have a bunch of flowers.Is it Valentine's Day ? __eou__ Oh , yes ! I completely forgot about it . __eou__ Did you have a fight with Jack ? __eou__ No , but now he'll be in trouble . What's a boyfriend for ? To forget about Valentine's Day ? __eou__ Come on , dear ! You forgot it , too . __eou__ You know , it's OK for a girl to forget these " big days " , but for a guy , to do that is unforgivable . __eou__ Is that your phone ? __eou__ Oh , it's Jack . Excuse me . __eou__ Wow ! Good timing . __eou__ He asked me out to a dinner tonight . How about joining us ? __eou__ Come on ! Three's a crowd ! __eou__ So what ? __eou__ Just go ! It's Valentine's Day ! __eou__
I heard that your previous manager was very capable , he is a good manger . __eou__ That ’ s a matter of opinion . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I worked with him for two years . That was the worst time in my career . __eou__
And lots of " Dear Abby " sob stories ... __eou__ Hey ! I learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns ! __eou__ No wonder you're such a wacko ... __eou__ Whatever ... Smell ! Perfume samples ! __eou__ Nice . Hey , I like the layout of this page ... __eou__ You mean , you like the pictures of the beautiful models ... Hello ? __eou__
How many cleaning ladies does your company hire ? __eou__ We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education . __eou__ Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job . __eou__ But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she Isa backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things . __eou__
I find that every employee here respects that manager very much . __eou__ Yes . He carries a lot of weight . Everyone here is willing to follow his orders . __eou__
What's your favorite book ? __eou__ It's Gone With the Wind . __eou__ Why do you like it best ? __eou__ I enjoy the various characters and the plot . __eou__ Well . I like the Thom Birds best . __eou__ Is it very interesting ? __eou__ Sure . I like the writer's language , too . __eou__ If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book . __eou__ Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ? __eou__ That's a good idea.Let ' s go ! __eou__
It ’ s a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men ’ s Volleyball world championship . My name is Rick Fields and I ’ m joined by the man with the plan , Bob Copeland . __eou__ Thank you , Rick . We ’ Ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams , Brazil and China , face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . Without a doubt , both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match . __eou__ The ref signals the start of the game and here we go . Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball . Chen bumps it to the setter , and ... a very nice set by Chen ! __eou__ Xu spikes it ! Wow , what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in ! __eou__ It ’ s China ’ s service now . What a superb jump serve by Li , oh , and we have a let serve . The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net . __eou__ Brazil calls for a time out and we ’ ll be right back , after a short commercial break . __eou__
Hello , Grace . That's a beautiful skirt you have on . Where are you going ? __eou__ I am going to attend an interview . __eou__ What kind of job are you applying for ? __eou__ My major is English . Of course I'll apply for an English teacher . __eou__ Oh . That dress doesn't exactly match the job . __eou__ Why ? You said my skirt was beautiful just now . __eou__ Yes , your skirt is really beautiful , but you are applying for a teaching position . You see , your skirt is very short , and your make up is too thick . What's more , the color of your lipstick doesn't match your skin . As a teacher , you should be a little more sedate . __eou__ Then what should I do ? __eou__ Some of my friends tell me that being a teacher , the most important is the beauty of mind . You shouldn't pay too much attention to your appearance . You should appear frugal and prudent . Your experience and knowledge will gain the appreciation of your interviewer . __eou__
I don't know how John can put up with his son , who fools around without working . __eou__ He's out of John's hands . Nothing he can do about such a black sheep . __eou__ If I were him , I would give him a good talking-to . I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that . __eou__
London is such a historical city ! There ’ s history everywhere you look . There ’ s nelson ’ s column , built as a monument to one of the Britain ’ s great admirals and his important victory . He won the battle of Trafalgar in 1805 . __eou__ I ’ m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey , where many historical figures are buried , like Isaac Newton , the great mathematician and Winston Churchill , the great wartime leader . __eou__ Nearby , on the banks of the thames , there ’ s the statue of Boadicea . She fought the Romans when they invaded Britain . __eou__ Women have often played an important role in British history . Queen Elizabeth I built a navy strong enough to fight off the Spanish armada in 1588 . more recently , Margaret thatcher transformed british society in the 1980 ’ s . __eou__ She was a very controversial leader . Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later ? __eou__ There ’ s a lot to see there . Perhaps we should go tomorrow . __eou__ I ’ m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . Many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . I really want to see the crown jewels too . __eou__ I ’ Ve seen them before . They ’ re quite incredible . If you want to see historical figures in London , there ’ s one place you have to go . __eou__ Where ’ s that ? Oh , I know ! Madame Tussaud ’ s the waxworks museum . __eou__ There you can see british leaders , entertainers , criminals , and royalty . __eou__ Sometimes , it ’ s hard to know who belongs in each section of the museum ! __eou__
so , how should we go to the theatre ? __eou__ let's take the bus . __eou__ I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . __eou__ it's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . __eou__ it wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . __eou__ we could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . __eou__ train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . __eou__ if we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ? __eou__ we're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi . __eou__ I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus . __eou__ fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives . __eou__ it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . __eou__ don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you . __eou__ thanks , that was nice of you . __eou__ see , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip ! __eou__
Mary , please go to the door . I hear the bell . __eou__ It's the mailman , Mother . Here's a letter from Uncle George . __eou__ Give it to me ... How wonderful ! He's coming to visit us . __eou__ When's he coming ? __eou__ He's coming by car on the twenty-fourth . He's staying from thetwenty-fourth to the twenty-sixth . __eou__ Let me look at the calendar . Good ! The twenty-fourth is a Saturday . Is he coming alone ? __eou__ No , he's coming with Aunt Cynthia and the girls . __eou__ Mother , I don't remember the girls . How old are they ? __eou__ Your cousin Fay is fifteen . Rosemary is older than Fay . She's seventeen . __eou__ Are they going to stay here with us ? __eou__ Of course . The girls can stay in your room with you . __eou__ Mother , may we have a party ? __eou__ If you like , but now we have to think about meals and many other things . __eou__ Prepare the list , Mother . I can go shopping . I can go to the small stores.Everyone knows me there . __eou__
What's your little caper ? Come home so late ! We are all worried about you . __eou__ Oh , I am terribly sorry . But I was so captivated with the singer at the subway exit . So I forgot the time . __eou__ Singing ? At the subway exit ? Oh , it sounds like someone needs some money . __eou__ Oh , no , the guy was a musician who just sang . He played the guitar and sang so many cool pop songs . Many people were drawn to his music and there was no hat on the floor . He sang for appreciation , but not for money . __eou__ It is just pop song , you could have sung there too if you want it . __eou__ Oh , no , it was a kind of pop art . I like it but I couldn't do it that well . __eou__ Honey , just do it next time . Have you heard of the real art in the subway station in Russia ? __eou__ No , but tell me some . I am interested . __eou__ Many oil painting exhibitions are there . That is a kind of Museum Exhibition . __eou__ Are there many people there ? Do you think people actually like them ? __eou__ I am sure you will . There are some works , and some students who major in painting interpret the meaning for visitors . And people can enjoy the paintings while waiting for the train . __eou__ But I still prefer the pop music in the subway . __eou__ Both the pop music and the oil painting ate arts , but with different aesthetic values . __eou__ Dad , you talk well , but can you appreciate that kind of art ? __eou__ Not well enough , but I'm learning . __eou__
It's wonderful to be in the mountains after a hustle bustle week . __eou__ Indeed . I love the smell of the grass and trees . They certainly refresh my mind . __eou__ Can we stop here for a while ? My backpack is very heavy . __eou__ Sure . Did you hear anything ? Look ! An eagle is hovering in the sky . __eou__ Let me see . It's not an eagle . I think it's a vulture . __eou__ Yes . Will it hurt us ? __eou__ I don't think so . Let's walk by the stream . I am sure we can find the waterfall on the map . __eou__ OK . I have a good pair of hiking boots . It should not be a big problem . __eou__ I also brought a bottle of water and some provisions . If you are hungry , you can let me know . __eou__ You are kind . Look there is a big tree over there , it looks like a thousand-year-old tree . __eou__ Well , it is a birch tree.It is not as old as you think . __eou__ How do you know ? __eou__ Because its trunk is not thick enough to be like a thousand-year-old tree . __eou__
Can we talk ? __eou__ Sure , honey , we ’ re talking now , aren ’ t we ? __eou__ You know what I mean . __eou__ Yeah . I know . __eou__ I want to know where this relationship is going . I ’ m in love with you and I need to know ... __eou__ You know , I think you ’ re awesome . __eou__ I ’ m awesome . Well , I guess that ’ s my answer , isn ’ t it . __eou__ Honey ... __eou__ Look , if you don ’ t love me , it ’ s not a thing , alright , we ’ Ve had our laughs , but I don ’ t appreciate ... maybe it ’ s just time we ... __eou__ Baby , I love you so much . __eou__ You do ? __eou__ I love you . And I think you ’ re awesome . __eou__ Oh , I love you too ! __eou__ Come on . Put the gun down . __eou__ Oh baby , I ’ m so sorry . __eou__
Would you like to come over for dinner tonight ? __eou__ Sure , but I have to tell you that I've become a vegetarian . I don't eat any kind of meat . __eou__ When did you decide to become a vegetarian ? __eou__ I saw a program a few months ago about how animals are raised for human consumption . I haven't been able to eat a single piece of meat since . __eou__ That's great . Do you find that you eat a lot more fruit and vegetables now ? __eou__ Definitely . I've also been buying organic fruit and vegetables , which is more expensive , but much better for you because they don't have any pesticides on them . __eou__ You've really turned into a health nut , haven't you ? __eou__ I guess you could say that . Eating fruit and vegetables helps keep you healthy . I've lost 5 pounds and I feel great ! __eou__ How do you get enough protein in your diet ? __eou__ Well , I eat a lot more tofu , beans , nuts and some fish . __eou__ Well , don't worry about dinner . I'll only make vegetarian dishes for you . Do you like sushi ? __eou__ I prefer cooked fish to raw fish , but if you really like it , make it . __eou__ How about a spicy tofu and vegetable stir-fry ? __eou__ That sounds great . What time should I come over ? __eou__ Dinner will be ready at about 7:30 pm , so you can come over at 7 p . m . __eou__ Sounds good . See you there ! __eou__
How old is Keith ? __eou__ He ’ s 21 . how old is James ? __eou__ He ’ s a year older than Keith , but he looks younger . __eou__ How ’ s your father ? __eou__ He ’ s fine . He retired last week . It ’ s turning going in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement . __eou__ He can spend more time with his grandchildren . __eou__ Oh , I don ’ t think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world . __eou__ So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea ! __eou__ How do you want to spend your old age ? __eou__ In the same way , probably . __eou__
Is this seat taken ? __eou__ No . Please sit down . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ Are you also going to Beijing ? __eou__ Yes , on a business trip . How about Yuu ? __eou__ I'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there . Have you ever been there before ? __eou__ Yes , I Went there once last summer . __eou__ Really ? What did you think ? __eou__ I think it is amazing . You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway . __eou__ Was it that crowded ? __eou__ Yes.These were always so many people.After taking the subway during the rush hour , you'll envy sardines in their cans . __eou__ Oh , maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car . __eou__ That's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation ! __eou__ Thank you very much ! __eou__
I love ice cream . __eou__ Really ? Me , too . What's your favorite flavor ? __eou__ I like both strawberry and coffee ice cream . __eou__ Chocolate is mine . __eou__
Would you like to go skiing with me ? I heard the new ski area is great . They have safe tracks , especially for the beginners and provide free training . I think it suits you best . __eou__ Sounds not bad ! You know , the only thing I worried about is the safety . I ’ m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport . __eou__ Well , Then you can go to the three-day-long training camp first . There ’ re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise . __eou__ I will think about it . __eou__ Come on ! It is really a fun game . __eou__
Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ? __eou__ Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ? __eou__ Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable . __eou__ That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems . __eou__ Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ? __eou__ When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports . __eou__ I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ? __eou__ Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it . __eou__ Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo . __eou__ Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits . __eou__ You should go to talk with May . She is a big fan of them too . __eou__ Sure . What about you ? What do you like about the Olympics ? __eou__ For me , the Olympics for the disabled always catches my heart . It makes me understand that perseverance makes the impossible possible . __eou__ Hey , young man , you are so deep today . __eou__ I always am . You just didn't notice . __eou__
It is difficult for old people to do away with old ideas . __eou__ So the reform cannot be carried out well . __eou__ Government is making efforts to change situation . __eou__ Easier said than done . __eou__
Does she make any sense to you ? __eou__ No . It's all Greek to me . __eou__ She's speaking French , not Greek . __eou__ I know that . I mean I couldn't understand her at all . __eou__ Me neither . All I have to do is study French hard . __eou__ I wish you the best of luck . __eou__
How are you going all these days ? __eou__ Fine , thanks . __eou__ But you look depressed . __eou__ I have some problem with my work . __eou__ Is it serious ? __eou__ I can solve it , thanks . __eou__ How about your family ? __eou__ Everything is Okay . And as soon as I see my son at home , all my worries vanish into the blue . __eou__
So what do you feel like doing this evening ? How about going to the cinema ? __eou__ Ah , that's a good idea . But I heard the film club of our school would show a film for free . Maybe we don't need to go to the cinema . __eou__ That's good ! I've also heard there will be a party held by the Students ' Union tomorrow evening . Would you like to go with me tomorrow night ? __eou__ I'd like to , but I'm afraid I can't . __eou__ Why ? Do you have to prepare for your examination ? Oh , come on , girl , relaxation is also very important . __eou__ That's not the reason . I have to go to the English Corner tomorrow evening . You know , I've been going there every week . __eou__ Oh , God , I've forgotten it . __eou__ You said you wanted to improve your English , so how about coming with me tomorrow ? I can also introduce some friends to you . __eou__ Oh , no , I don't want to know any more geeks like you . __eou__ They are not geeks . They are also interested in singing , dancing , and so on . They are excellent , and they can always help me a lot . __eou__ Really ? Is there a foreign teacher for every class ? __eou__ It depends . If they are not busy , they will come to join us , and talk with us . __eou__ So you just talk all the time ? __eou__ Of course not . The foreign teachers also teach us English songs , and play games with us . __eou__ That sounds interesting . I'll go with you tomorrow evening . __eou__ You won't be disappointed . __eou__
You ’ re going to set up your own law office , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . After so many years of hard work , I ’ d rather I had an office of my own . __eou__ If you need help , don ’ t hesitate to ask me . __eou__ I ’ ll be very glad if you would help . __eou__ I ’ d like to wish you every success in your new venture . __eou__ Thank you . I wish I would . __eou__ Good luck to you . __eou__
Wow , is that your sports car ? __eou__ Yes , do you like it ? __eou__ I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ? __eou__ Yt looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again . __eou__ What's wrong with it ? __eou__ Well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive . __eou__ When's the last time you had it serviced ? __eou__ It must have been a few years ago now . __eou__ I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis . __eou__ They do . Once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater , you know ! __eou__ What else is wrong with it ? __eou__ The heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer ! __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ The brakes don't really work that well anymore either . __eou__ Why don't you get it all fixed ? __eou__ It costs more than you think to run a car---especially when there are so many things wrong with it ! __eou__ Well , let me know when you can get it fixed . I ’ d love to go for a ride in it ! __eou__
Can you play baseball with me today ? __eou__ No , I can't . I'm sorry . I have to help my mother . We're going to move tomorrow . __eou__ Where's the new house ? Is it far from here ? __eou__ No , it's not far . It's near our old house . __eou__ Can I help you pack ? __eou__ Sure . Thanks . __eou__
I think I need a new notebook . __eou__ Why ? Is there some new , cool computer out on the market ? __eou__ You bet there is . Feast your eyes on this puppy ! __eou__ That's a notebook ? __eou__ Believe it ! __eou__ It looks more like a toy , or a cool briefcase ! __eou__
Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ? __eou__ I suppose I do . __eou__ The climate here is pleasant . __eou__ You said it . __eou__ This city is really comfortable to live in . __eou__ It sure is . __eou__ No other city can match it . It's heaven . __eou__ Well , if you live in other cities as long as enough , you will love them just as much . __eou__ Maybe . __eou__ That's for sure . __eou__
Ah , Michelle , hi . I was hoping to see you . How have you been ? How's the family ? __eou__ Oh , hello , Mr . Campbell . I'm fine and Jack's doing well . How are you ? __eou__ I'm fine thanks . I got your report this morning . Thank's for that . Are you joining the conference today ? __eou__ Yes , I'm leaving at four pm . __eou__ Good , well we can discuss this more then , but I think the figures are looking very good for this quarter . __eou__ Yes , me too . __eou__ I'm planning to discuss the advertising budget at the conference . I don't think we should continue with the TV advertising . __eou__
Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed ! Then they are sold on the black market . __eou__ Don't tell me you actually believe all that ? Don't be so gullible , they are just urban legends . They are just stories people make up to scare you . __eou__ Well , I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards ! Can you believe that ? __eou__ You really think an artist or song writer is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song ? Don't be so naive ! __eou__ Well maybe you are right , but how about the story of how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster ! __eou__ Sounds a bit too far fetched to be true , don't you think ? __eou__
Hi Bob , this is my friend Mary . __eou__ I am very pleased to meet you . __eou__ Bob is in advertising . __eou__ That sounds an interesting job , Bob . __eou__
Wow ! I can ’ t believe I ’ m standing here ! __eou__ What are you so excited about ? __eou__ I ’ m standing in front of an exquisite work of art ! __eou__ What ’ s the big deal ? It ’ s just a picture of some woman . __eou__ I ’ Ve seen it so many times in books , but I never imagined I ’ d get to see it in person . __eou__ There are tons of other paintings that I think are better . __eou__ Maybe so , but do you have any idea how much this one is worth ? __eou__ No , how much is it worth ? __eou__ About 80 million dollars . __eou__ Whoa . __eou__
Lady , you look unhappy . What ’ s the beef ? __eou__ A man stepped on my feet when I was waiting for the taxi . __eou__
When were you Bron may I ask ? __eou__ On 20th May 1963 . __eou__ Do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ? __eou__ 27th day of the fourth month . __eou__ By the way , could you tell me when the film will begin ? __eou__ It will begin at 5 thirty . __eou__ I am frigid I can't be there on time . __eou__ You can see it tomorrow . __eou__ I don't want to miss it today . __eou__ See you . __eou__ See you . __eou__
Did you see the 2005 Grammy Awards on TV last night . __eou__ Yeah . I was so happy , because my favorite singer , Ricky Martin won ' Best Latin Pop Performance ' . __eou__ He seems to win awards everywhere . __eou__ He is really great . He has sold millions of records worldwide . He is especially known for his rocking performance at the football World Cup song-the Cup of World . __eou__ I heard one observer even said ' It was a song sung in Spanish for international football , and he made it so popular that even the Americans loved it . ' __eou__ That's right . His voice ranges from the smooth sound of ballads to the highpowered rhythms of the Spanish Caribbean where he grew up . He has fan clubs across the world , from America to Russia , from England to Taiwan , from Norway to Australia . __eou__
Ben cancelled his trip . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ Because General , his dog , got sick . __eou__ He's such a mother hen . __eou__
Hi Jane , you look great . __eou__ You too . Have you lost some weight ? __eou__ Yes , I took off 4 kilos . I am glad you notice it . __eou__ Not some crazy diet fat I hope . __eou__ No no , I just changed my eating habits . I eat a balance meal . and I eat less than before . __eou__ Good for you , keep it up . __eou__
It may comfort you to know that many people attended his viewing . __eou__ How did they hear ? No one called . __eou__ In times of loss , it is often hard to pick up the phone . But his whole family was here . __eou__ His mom and dad must be destroyed . He was their only son . __eou__ And he was so young , with so much life to look forward to . __eou__ Yes ... thank you for understanding . We have to go now . __eou__ This sheet tells the visiting hours and funeral time and location . __eou__
OK . Steven , you're looking at a picture . Please describe what you see ! __eou__ Uh , I can see a red double decker bus . It's the kind of bus you'll see very often in London . In fact I know this bus is from London because I can see the names , Chelsea , Sloan Square , Victoria , Herring Cross . These are all areas in London . Um , so obviously the bus is in London . __eou__ OK . Have you ever been on a double decker bus ? __eou__ Yeah , yeah , yeah . many times . Many times . When I was younger , you used to get double-decker all over England but now you only tend to see them in the big cities . __eou__ Oh , really . Mm ! How much is the fare ? __eou__ Well , it depends on the journey . It's .. I guess it's not too expensive , but the minimum price you would pay is , for a short journey , is about a pound . __eou__ Mm , yeah , who can you see on the bus ? Can you pick out anyone on the bus who looks interesting ? __eou__ Hmm , yeah , well this girl here at the back , that's leaning on the door , um , she looks really bored , actually . Maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn't want to go ! __eou__ Is that how you feel on the bus ? __eou__ Uh , well , no , not really , because I haven't worked in England for a long time , so I haven't taken a bus for a long time . __eou__ So , so you're British , do you missing them ? __eou__ Um , yes , sometimes . Sometimes . __eou__
Is the view going to be ok ? __eou__ Don ’ t worry , you did a good job and it should be fine . __eou__ I ’ ll do my best . __eou__ That ’ s the way to go . __eou__
I got a promotion . Lunch is on me . __eou__ It ’ s great . __eou__
You can keep these books for only half a month . __eou__ May I renew them if I haven't finished reading them ? __eou__ Of course , you can . __eou__
Bob , you look pale . What happened ? __eou__ I didn't sleep a wink last night . __eou__ Did you have something on your mind ? You look so concerned ! Maybe I can help you . __eou__ Well , I'm under a lot of pressure . My boss is very pushy . He assigned me two projects . Now the deadlines are near and I still haven't finish one of them . __eou__ Is there anything I can do for you ? __eou__ Well , I guess no one can help me but myself . For the moment , I just need someone to talk to so that I can relieve my stress . __eou__ I know your feeling . Take it easy . __eou__
Which team won ? __eou__ The Spur . __eou__ What was the score ? __eou__ They managed a 99:80 victory . __eou__
You know ... I did very poorly on that test . __eou__ Cheer up ! It's not the only chance in life to do well on a test . There'll be many more . __eou__ Well , you know how I am about exams . I'm a perfectionist . __eou__ Don't worry about it . All in all , you've done very well in school . __eou__
What happened to Nancy ? She is all sweetness and light today . __eou__ She is going to get married . __eou__ No wonder ! Who is the bridegroom ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . __eou__
I think Bill Clinton is a good president . __eou__ But he has the sex scandal . __eou__ Well . Maybe he isn't a good husband , but he is a successful president . __eou__ I agree . He is also an excellent speaker . __eou__ Yes , he is . Of course he makes mistakes , but who doesn ’ t . __eou__ yeah , it ’ s fair to say so . __eou__
What good sunshine ! Let's go and get a suntan on the balcony . __eou__ I've had enough of it while working under the sun in the day . I don't need any more sun-tan . __eou__ It's different in my case . I work in the office , so only rarely do I get the chance to get any sun . __eou__ It might be good to you . But please keep in mind that too much tanning damages the skin rather than does any good to you . You might end up with skin cancer . __eou__
Would you like to stretch your legs ? __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Let's get a soft drink . __eou__ Do we have enough time ? __eou__ Yes , we do . __eou__ The performance is excellent . __eou__ It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great . __eou__ I couldn't agree more . __eou__ Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ Do you have concert halls in your city ? __eou__ Yes , but it's much smaller . __eou__ Well , we'd better get back to our seats . It's about to start . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Wake up sleepyhead.The sun is beginning to shine . What a lovely summer day ! __eou__ Yeah , clearly blue sky.But it is a bit too hot for me . I don't like heat and humidity . __eou__ It's not that hot . It's cooler than yesterday . Let's go swimming ! __eou__ That's a thought . It's still early , and the beach isn't crowded at this time of the day . If we don't stay too long , we won't get sunburned . __eou__ Yeah , sounds like fun . I can wear my new pink bikini . __eou__ There won't be anyone there to appreciate how cute you are . __eou__ Who cares ! Well , the smart guys get there early . That's the kind of guy I want to meet . Let's go ! __eou__ If you are going to husband hunting in a bikini , then I want to wear one , too . __eou__ Ok , you could borrow one of mine . __eou__ Thanks , how about the green and black one ? __eou__ No problem . Here it is . __eou__
It's a beautiful day , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , isn't it . __eou__ Do you now the temperature today ? __eou__ It's beautiful 75 degrees . __eou__ How nice . I hope the weather will stay like this for the whole week . I'm going on the canoe trip this weekend . __eou__ Not a good plan . The TV weather forecast says the hurricane is coming this weekend , and the temperature will also drop to 66 degrees . __eou__ What a nuisance ! Every time I plan to go canoeing or camping , a storm comes along . The sky gets dark , the wind starts to howl and the temperature drops.Well , I'd better stay home . __eou__ I never make any definite weekend plan until Friday morning . Then after listening to the weather temperature , I make my plans . __eou__ That's smart . I'm going to start doing the same thing . __eou__
are you ready to go the concert ? __eou__ yes . Should we go there by bus so we aren't late ? __eou__ actually , why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in such hour . __eou__ that's true . Cycling is good for our environment , too . Let me just get my helmet then . __eou__ is your helmet comfortable ? __eou__ not really , but I liked the design , so I got it . __eou__ maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better . __eou__ I'll think about it . __eou__ is that your new bicycle ? __eou__ yes , my father gave it to me for my birthday . Do you like it ? __eou__ it's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . These are really expensive ! __eou__ nothing but the best from my dad . I like everything about it except for the brakes . They are a bit sticky . __eou__ I can fix those for you . Is there anything else wrong with it ? __eou__ well , my saddle is too low for me . Do you know how to change the height ? __eou__ that's easy . It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle . __eou__ is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike ? __eou__ it's possible . Give me a minute and I can fix these for you and then we can go . __eou__
Next please ! Hello sir , may I see your passport please ? __eou__ Yes , here you go . __eou__ Will you be checking any bags today . __eou__ Yes , I ’ d like to check three pieces . __eou__ I ’ m sorry , sir . Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage , at twenty kilograms each , plus one piece of carry-on luggage . I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase . __eou__ What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ’ m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ’ s absurd ! __eou__ I am sorry , sir , there ’ s nothing I can do . You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . That bag is clearly too big . __eou__ Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me , miss , how much will I have to pay for all of this . __eou__ Let ’ s see ... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars . __eou__ That ’ s more than my round-trip ticket ! __eou__
Do you feel like going to see a movie tonight ? __eou__ I'd like that very much . __eou__ How does 7:30 sound ? __eou__ Fine . See you later . __eou__
How are you ? __eou__ Fine . __eou__ I haven ’ t seen you for several days . __eou__ Oh , I have been with my uncle for a week . __eou__ What ’ s he doing ? __eou__ He is an accountant . I have been helping him for a week . __eou__ He must be happy . __eou__ Yeah . How are you these days ? __eou__ Fine too . __eou__
So what kind of music turns you on ? __eou__ Rock ' n'Roll , I guess . __eou__ You mean the kind of stuff like Nirvana ? __eou__ Not really . That ’ s pretty heavy metal . __eou__
Dick , I ’ Ve decided not to rent that house . __eou__ But yesterday you said you would rent it . __eou__ I ’ Ve changed my mind . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ Well , I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work . __eou__ Maybe you ’ re right . __eou__
Hi ! How are you going ? __eou__ Fine , thank you.How are you doing this morning ? __eou__ Not bad.How about you ? Haven't seen you for a long time . __eou__ Yes . I've been to New York . I got back only yesterday . __eou__ Did you enjoy yourself ? __eou__ Very much.New York is such a nice place.Shall I show you some photographs ? __eou__ Thanks , I like looking at photographs.How nice ! Oh , I'm afraid I must be going now . I've got an appointment . Have a good day . __eou__ You too . I hope to see you soon.Goodbye . __eou__ Goodbye . __eou__
You ready ? __eou__ Am I ready for what ? __eou__ Are you ready to transfer to a new school tomorrow ? __eou__ Oh . Yes , I ’ m ready to transfer . __eou__ You ’ re not nervous , are you ? __eou__ I ’ m very nervous . __eou__ Why are you nervous ? __eou__ I ’ m not going to know anybody there . __eou__ That ’ s not a problem . __eou__ That makes me nervous . __eou__ It ’ s fun meeting new people . __eou__ I didn ’ t think about it that way . __eou__
Did you see Victor on Wednesday , Wendy ? __eou__ Yes . We went for a walk in the woods near the highway . __eou__ Wasn ’ t it cold on Wednesday ? __eou__ Yes . It was very cold and windy . We wore heavy wool sweaters and walked quickly to keep warm . __eou__ It ’ s so nice and quiet in the woods . __eou__ Yes . Farther away from the highway it was very quiet and there were birds and squirrels everywhere . We counted over twenty squirrels . __eou__ It sounds wonderful . Did you take lunch with you ? __eou__ Yes , we bought veal sandwiches . We stopped around twelve , and we ate and watched the squirrels , but it was too windy to sit long . It was a very nice walk , anyway . __eou__
Wow ! That ’ s a pretty dress , but it ’ s too expensive . __eou__ Yeah , it is ! Why is it so expensive ? __eou__ It ’ s because of good quality and the fine design . __eou__ I don ’ t think it ’ s worth that money . __eou__ Anyhow , this dress is really elegant . __eou__
How is your business going ? __eou__ Business couldn't be better . __eou__ Really ? Maybe I should work for you . __eou__ Welcome . I could use the help . __eou__
Hey , what's the matter ? __eou__ It doesn't matter . I just feel a little dizzy . __eou__ Are you sure that this has nothing to do with sleep ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__
I've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . I wonder how you managed to achieve such success ? __eou__ Oh , through a lot of hard work , of course . __eou__ I suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it ? __eou__ Surely it was , especially when you only knew few people and little English . __eou__ You mean you didn ’ t know much English then ? __eou__ Right . I only knew a few English sentences . __eou__ That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ? __eou__ First , I worked as a servant . __eou__ Really ? I wish you could tell me more about your experience . __eou__ I'd like to , but I must run to a meeting . __eou__
What's the news on our website ? How effective do you think it is from a marketing standpoint ? __eou__ We've been able to survey and track some of the information of our website users through some cookie technology , and it's surprising to see the results . __eou__ What kinds of hits are we getting on our company's website ? __eou__ From the numbers , it seems nearly half of the visitors who stumble onto our page pick up the link not from network browsers or search engines , but from our circular insert . That means our consumers are purposefully and actively seeking information about our products and services through the web format . Based on these findings , I am completely convinced the internet is the marketing power of the future ! __eou__ You really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information.What about the old standbys of word mouth and print media ? __eou__ Well , these mediums are still important ... they aren't a thing of the past ... But I think they might be less important now than in the past . The technology age has arrived ! __eou__
What do you know about Julia Roberts ? __eou__ Her acting is OK . __eou__ I mean her personality . __eou__ I'm afraid I know less than you do.Tell me more about her , will you ? __eou__
I've never seen a machine like this before and need some help . __eou__ Sure , no problem . What are you trying to get ? __eou__ I want to buy a drink . __eou__ OK . This machine needs you to use that change machine first to get correct change . __eou__ I've got the correct change already . __eou__ First you put your money in the dollar slot or the coin slot . The dollars have to be smooth . __eou__ OK , what next ? __eou__ Just know that sometimes the money doesn't go in perfectly the first time and you have to try again . __eou__ OK , next ? __eou__ Choose what you want and push the button . Sometimes it takes a couple of tries . __eou__ I agree with you . __eou__ Hope that works for you ! __eou__
Honey , wait ! I've sprained my ankle . __eou__ Oh , my god , are you OK ? __eou__ Of course not ! __eou__ Come on , sit down , and let me have a look . __eou__ The pain is killing me . __eou__ I told you to wear running shoes . But you don't listen . __eou__ I thought leather shoes will do just as well . __eou__ Hold on , don't move , I will take care of that . __eou__ What are you going to do ? __eou__ I will get some ice , and put it on your ankle.How does that feel ? __eou__ God ! It's freezing ! __eou__ Be brave . Don't worry . You will be able to walk soon . __eou__
So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ? __eou__ Nine total . Seven children and my parents . __eou__ Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ? __eou__ Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it . __eou__ Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right . __eou__ It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make . __eou__ Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy . __eou__ That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs . __eou__ And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common . __eou__ Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college . __eou__ Well , at least going to college won't be too bad . Since both of your parents are college professors , they must give you reduced tuition at the college . __eou__ They do , but it doesn't help too much . Having seven children means that the money situation in my home is always pretty tight . __eou__
That was a nice funeral . __eou__ Yes , dad , it was . __eou__ The son gave a nice speech about his father . __eou__ It was long , too . __eou__ I think it was about 45 minutes long . __eou__ But it went by fast . It was interesting . __eou__ I liked it . __eou__ I'll give you a speech like that , too . __eou__ Do you think anyone will come to my funeral ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ I think only the family will be there . __eou__ You have lots of friends . They will be there , too ! __eou__
Hello ? __eou__ Hi , Randy . What are you doing right now ? __eou__ Nothing . Just watching TV . __eou__ I ’ Ve got two tickets for a newly released film . Would you like to see it with me ? __eou__ Sure . What time ? __eou__ The film will start at 2 __eou__ Sounds good . Where and when will we meet ? __eou__ In my parking lot , at 2pm . __eou__ All right . See you then . __eou__
How do you think TaiWan's economy is doing ? __eou__ Not too good actually , people are not spending as much as before ! __eou__ Do you know why that is ? __eou__ Lots of reasons I guess , unemployment is pretty high these days . __eou__
Does your child still believe in Santa Claus ? __eou__ Yes . She believes everything about him . __eou__ How sweet . __eou__ Yes . If she doesn't believe it , Christmas won't be so exciting to her . __eou__ When are you going to tell her that Santa Claus doesn't exist ? __eou__ I'm not going to tell her . She will find out and understand when she grows older . __eou__
I am kind of nervous . __eou__ Nervous ? Why ? __eou__ I don't know . I never went to a church before . I was not raised as a Christian , so I don't know what to do . __eou__ Don't worry . You don't have to do anything.All you have to do is listen . You will enjoy it . __eou__ Maybe . I know I agreed to go with you , but now I don't feel right about it . __eou__ Listen , Ryan.Catholics welcome people who aren't Catholics to visit the church.You don't have to pretend to be Catholic . It's okay if you just come to listen . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . We are kind and welcoming people.It is not a secret society or something like that . __eou__ Alright . But will we sing ? __eou__ Yes , but you don't even have to sing . If you want to sing along , you can . __eou__ I don't know the words . __eou__ There is a songbook . All the words are in the songbook.Many people have to read the words . __eou__ And will I go up to the front to have the bread and wine ? __eou__ No . That is something only true Catholics do.So if you come to the church as a visitor , you only listen to the service.But you shouldn't go up to the altar for the bread and wine.Only after someone joins the church , then they go up for the Eucharist . __eou__ Eu-char-ist ? What is that ? __eou__ That is the special word for the ritual of the bread and wine.The Catholics call it the Eucharist . __eou__ It doesn't sound like an English word . __eou__ It's not . It's an ancient Greek word . It means gratitude . __eou__ Alright . Well , I feel more comfortable now.Now I understand I am welcome as a visitor . __eou__ Of course you are . I wouldn't ask you otherwise . __eou__
Hey Jack . How were your classes this semester ? __eou__ They were not too bad . I really liked my poli-sci class . __eou__ Would you consider it your favorite class ? __eou__ I don't know if I would call it my favorite , but it ranks up there . __eou__ What class was your favorite then ? __eou__ I took a business communication class last year and it was terrific . __eou__ I never took that yet . If that was your favorite , I think I will check it out . __eou__
What are you reading ? __eou__ It ’ s an article about language . It talks about the idea of having a single global language . __eou__ It seems that English already is the main global language . Does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like Esperanto as the world language . __eou__ Actually , it suggest English . The main argument is that English is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china , India , mexico , Nigeria , Pakistan , and japan . So beginning again with a language like Esperanto would be wasteful . The second argument is that English is used in modern technology far more that any other language . Most emails are sent in English and the vast majority of website use English . __eou__ Does the article say anything about other language ? How will they survive in an English-speaking world ? __eou__ The article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost , but others will continue to be used for generation , even if English continues to be the dominant language . __eou__ Right . All the people who speak Chinese . Hindi , French and Spanish aren ’ t suddenly going to stop using those languages . __eou__ Exactly . The article suggests that those languages will be used , but that they will only rarely be used in international communication between non-native speakers . __eou__ In that case , I shall continue to learning a few basic phrases in other languages . __eou__
Are you have a hand in locking into the case ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ How do you feel about it ? __eou__ It is really a hard nut to crack . The problem is that the crime was done without leaving any trace . __eou__
Ahh ... What a fine day ! I do feel like an outdoor exercise . __eou__ How about taking a walk in the park ? __eou__ OK.It ' s delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh . __eou__ Oh , it's so quiet here.We have the park to ourselves , only you and me ! __eou__ Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your left . __eou__ Oh , I see them.Some are doing Taijiquan , some are performing swordplay , some are practising the Chinese Wushu . __eou__ A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China . __eou__
Another glass of beer , will you ? __eou__ Thanks , I'm enough . __eou__ At least one for your trip . __eou__ I'll have it if you insist . __eou__
Have you seen that house ? __eou__ Yes , it looks interesting . __eou__ You're right . I love it very much . __eou__ It must be old . __eou__ At least more than 100 years old . __eou__ Let's enter it ! __eou__ I can't open the door . __eou__ It must be locked . __eou__ Let me ask the old woman in that reception office . __eou__ She can't answer you . __eou__ She must be deaf . __eou__ It must be a haunted house.Are you frightened ? __eou__ Frightened ? You must be joking . __eou__
Good morning . Phyllis Seymour speaking . __eou__ Hi , Ms . Seymour ? It ’ s Allan Parker .

It's raining outside , Catherine , it's too bad.What ' s the weather like in your hometown ? __eou__ It's very hot , the temperature is often over 40 ° C . __eou__ Do you like the weather in Seattle ? __eou__ Not really.But I like it in spring and fall . I don't like it in winter . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ The winter is very rainy , I don't like the rainy day . __eou__ What about the weather in Boston ? __eou__ I lived there for three years . I like summer but I don't like winter . __eou__ Is it very cold in winter ? __eou__ Yes , it is.But it's nice in spring and fall . __eou__
Wei , you look really tired . __eou__ Yes , I didn ’ t finish work until 9:00 pm . __eou__ 9:00 ! __eou__ Yes , I have too much work to do at the moment . __eou__ Why ’ s that ? __eou__ Because too many people in the office are on holiday . __eou__
I've heard you're going to America tomorrow . I want to see you off at the airport . __eou__ Oh , thanks a lot . __eou__ What time are you leaving ? __eou__ 1:30 P . m . But I've got to check in at 12:30 P . m . __eou__ What airline and what flight ? __eou__ Pan American Airlines . Flight 282 . __eou__ I'll see you at the airport at 12:30 P . m . __eou__ Ok .

He was hauled up last week for the second time . __eou__ You mean he had been put in prison before . __eou__ Of course , he is a man with a history . __eou__ Oh , he had fooled me . __eou__
Hello . Can I sit here ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ By the way , I'm Robin . __eou__ Hi . My name is Jessica . __eou__ Nice to meet you . __eou__ Pleased to meet you too . And where are you from , Robin ? __eou__ I'm from Kathmandu . What about you ? __eou__ I'm from New York . Oh , this is my stop . Bye , Robin . __eou__ Bye . See you . __eou__
Well , I've never downloaded music before . How does it work ? __eou__ You haven't ? If you've never tried it I can show you how . __eou__ Alright . But why is downloading music better than buying Cds at the store ? __eou__ Downloading music is really fast and convenient , and you can preview all the songs before you buy them . __eou__
Hi ! How are you doing ? __eou__ Good , thanks . How about you ? __eou__ Pretty good . Say , where are you living this semester ? __eou__ In No . 4 Dorm . I like dorm life . You will meet a lot of people and you don't have to cook . What about you ? __eou__ Oh , I am looking for an apartment . I prefer living off campus . I can study better . __eou__ I hope you will find a place . Listen , I'd better go . I am going to be late for class . __eou__ Okay , see you around . __eou__ Take care . __eou__
I think modern painting means nothing . __eou__ I think so too . It's just pointless . __eou__ Then why are so many crazy about it __eou__ I don't know.Maybe they are really crazy . __eou__ Maybe . __eou__
I heard you are going to move . __eou__ Yes , I found a better house near my office . I ’ m very satisfied with it . But I ’ m worrying . __eou__ What are you worried about ? __eou__ I ’ m worrying about how to move all of my household stuff . You know , I have a lot of stuff . __eou__ You can call a mover . __eou__ How much dose that cost ? __eou__ Around 200 RIB for a truck . __eou__ I think it ’ s a little expensive . __eou__ But think about it , you just need to pack your stuff and leave everything for the movers , how much trouble you will save . __eou__ That ’ s right . __eou__ I know a mover which has a very good reputation for their service . I ’ ll leave you their phone number . __eou__ Wonderful . __eou__ It ’ s 8357688 8 . __eou__ Okay , thanks a lot . You did me a great favor just now . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
I saw your car outside , so I stooped by . __eou__ Yeah , I come here every now and then . __eou__
I just meant that she's got different taste . __eou__ What kind of girl is she ? __eou__ She's pretty conservative . __eou__ Is her fiance Taiwanese ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ How old is he ? __eou__ About 30 . He's really outgoing . But why do you ask ? __eou__
How have you been ? __eou__ Fine , thank you . __eou__ And how's everyone in your family ? __eou__ Very well , thank you . I'm meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at twelve.Would you care to join us ? __eou__ I'd love to , but I'm afraid I can't . __eou__
That girl looks very attractive , doesn ’ t she ? __eou__ Do you think so ? I don ’ t like girls who look like that . I like girls who aren ’ t too slim . If you like her , go and talk to her . __eou__ I ’ d like to , but there ’ s her boyfriend . He ’ s very broad-shouldered . __eou__ He ’ s huge ! He must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that . __eou__ Do you prefer tall girls or short ones ? __eou__ I don ’ t mind , but I like girls with long hair . __eou__ We have different tastes . I like girls with short hair . I like tall girls - probably because I ’ m so tall myself . __eou__ Have you ever dated a girl taller than you ? __eou__ No , never . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever met a girl taller than me ! Have you gained weight recently ? __eou__ Yes , I have . Perhaps I should go to the gym , like that girl ’ s boyfriend . __eou__ I'm getting a bit plump myself . Perhaps I ’ ll go with you . __eou__
Good morning , Linda . How have you been ? __eou__ Pretty bad . I ’ Ve had a bad cold for three days and still can ’ t get rid of it . __eou__ I ’ m sorry to hear that . Is there anything else I can do ? __eou__ No , thanks . __eou__ Well , I hope you ’ ll feel better soon . __eou__ Thank you for your concern . __eou__

Um , which of them is the better typist ? __eou__ Well , Mary types faster than Jones . But I think Jones types more carefully . __eou__ Is there any difference in their short hand ? __eou__ Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class . __eou__ How about languages ? __eou__ Both of them speak excellent French . But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does . __eou__ Um . That doesn ’ t really matter . Because we have more French visitors than German . __eou__
Today is your birthday . First of all , happy birthday to you ! __eou__ Thank you for coming . We will have dinner outside . Eat up ! __eou__
Excuse me . Is anyone sitting here ? __eou__ No , nobody . __eou__ You don ’ t mind if I smoke , do you ? __eou__ Well , to be frank , yes , I do . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry . But this isn ’ t a no-smoker , isn ’ t it ? I mean would you mind if I smoke here ? __eou__ Actually it is . Perhaps you haven ’ t noticed the sign . __eou__ Sign ? What ’ s sign ? __eou__ There , on the window . __eou__ Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t notice it . Sorry . __eou__ That ’ s all right . __eou__
I don't know whether or not to believe him . __eou__ You can trust him . He always tells the truth . __eou__ But it's really too important to me . __eou__ I said you can trust him . You just have to believe it . __eou__
I feel pity for the old man . __eou__ I feel the same way . __eou__ It must be dreadful to grow old . __eou__ It sure is.He has no one to turn to , very miserable indeed . __eou__
Excuse me , sir . Could you spare a minute ? __eou__ Uh , yes . __eou__ Do you go to work by train every day . __eou__ Yes . I commute five days a week by train . __eou__ And would you mind telling us what you think of the rail service ? __eou__ It ’ s really very good . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ Well , trains are frequent and come on time . __eou__ Which train do you catch in the evening ? __eou__ I usually take the five thirty home . __eou__ And can you get a seat ? __eou__ No , I usually have to stand . __eou__ Would you agree that the service is fast ? __eou__ Yes , it ’ s reasonably fast but it certainly isn ’ t cheap . Fares have gone up 25 present . __eou__
So , how'd everyone do ? __eou__ Well , there's this clock I was ... MY vintage clock ! How do you have my clock ? ? __eou__ Your vintage clock ? ! I just paid sixty-five dollars for it . __eou__ Sixty-five ? What the ... ? How did you bargain him down , Wei ? You've never even been to a flea market before ! __eou__ It must be my special touch . I think bargaining is in my blood ! __eou__ Never underestimate a woman when it comes to bargaining ! __eou__
You are studying here , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . I have been here for three years . __eou__ Do you like this campus ? __eou__ Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected . __eou__ Oh . It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped . __eou__ I ’ ll just have to put up with it . __eou__
Would you mind if I smoked ? __eou__ I'd rather you didn't . __eou__
How do you feel about the TV series ? __eou__ Oh , to be frank , I think it's sheer waste of time to watch it . __eou__ Yes , I agree , but still a lot of people watch it . __eou__ But I don't think much of it . __eou__
I've brought some potato chips . Would you like some , Jack ? __eou__ Yes . I'd like to swap some of my peanuts for your chips . __eou__ That'll be fine . Thanks . __eou__ Do you have any ketchup ? __eou__ I forgot to bring it , but maybe Mary has some . Let's go and ask her . __eou__
Harry is a hen-pecked husband . __eou__ No , he isn ’ t . __eou__ Then why does he let himself be lead by the nose ? __eou__ He is afraid of his father-in-law . __eou__
Have you ever found yourself in a situation when you have to lie to people who trust you ? __eou__ Do you mean lying to people for their good ? __eou__ Yes . Is it wrong to lie to them even if it is for their good ? __eou__ It's hard to say . I mean , how can you judge what's good for them ? Maybe it is best to tell them the truth no matter what it is . __eou__ But sometimes it is so hard to tell the truth . __eou__ I know . If you're sure the truth will do harm , maybe you can choose not to tell it . __eou__
Hi , Julie . I was in your neighborhood and I'd like to drop by . __eou__ Come on in . Would you care for a drink ? __eou__ That sounds refreshing . Thanks ! __eou__
May , is the university a terrible place ? __eou__ Surely not . Life in the university is fun . Why did you ask ? __eou__ Because you study day in and day out for the entrance exam . So I figure you would study even harder after you ’ Ve got in . __eou__ Studying in the university is not easy , but it's not as arduous as you think . __eou__ How do you know that ? You haven't got in yet . __eou__ Of course I know . I once attended Lisa's class , sitting quietly at the back of the classroom . __eou__ Oh , really ? Were you not caught ? __eou__ Of course not . You are allowed to attend any lecture , only if there are empty seats for you and you don't disturb the class . In universities , you study in a free and creative environment . __eou__ What do you want to study in the university ? Have you thought about it ? __eou__ This question has really been bothering me . I like Chinese literature , you know . But economics is really hot now , and it has a very good career prospect . __eou__ I will choose what I like . You don't know what a torture it is for me to study English , because I don't like English . __eou__ Though I like Chinese literature very much , I'm also interested in economics . It's a tough choice to make . __eou__ You can decide later . You will have choices before you submit your university application form . __eou__ Right . I have lots of time to think carefully before I make my final decision . __eou__
Who is your favorite NBA star ? __eou__ Kobe Bryant , of course . __eou__ Kobe ? I know him , the key guy of the Lakers , a heck of a NBA player . He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense . __eou__ He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand . __eou__ Maybe he is not good at rebounding ? __eou__ Indeed , no man can be perfect . He is just so-so in crashing the boards . Usually he plays shooting guard . Rebounding might not be his strong suit . __eou__ Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics . Did you go to the match between China and USA ? __eou__ Who wouldn't ! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him . __eou__ Well then , what are your spoils ? __eou__ Well , nothing more than a jumble of photographs . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ I would like to find this book . __eou__ Is there a problem ? __eou__ I don ’ t think you guys have it . __eou__ You should look it up on our computer . __eou__ I did that . __eou__ What came up ? __eou__ It should be on the shelf , but I didn ’ t see it . __eou__ I can try to get the book from a different library . __eou__ I didn ’ t know you could do that . __eou__ I will call you when I find it . __eou__ I appreciate your help . __eou__
What happened ? __eou__ It was just a misunderstanding . __eou__
I hear little Bob has recovered . __eou__ That's a great relief . I was worried about him . __eou__ The operation was very successful . __eou__ His parents must feel very happy . __eou__
Are you in favor of having a trip during the spring break ? __eou__ This is just what I have in mind.Where are you planning to go ? __eou__ How about the Yellow Mountains ? __eou__ Good idea ! __eou__
Did you go to the movie yesterday ? __eou__ Yes , I did . __eou__ What did you think of it ? __eou__ I don't think much of the film . __eou__ I think it is the worst one I have ever seen . __eou__ Oh , I'm not sure I agree with you . It was not a good one , but it was not the worst one . Actually , it wasn't too bad . __eou__ I can't think the same . __eou__ What's more , some scenes were good , much fit for the children . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you . __eou__
Thanks for offering to give me a lift . I ’ m looking forward to this party , but I didn ’ t want to go alone . __eou__ Don ’ t mention it . It ’ s my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ? __eou__ No , this is my first.Last week I went to a cookout for new professors at Dean Barksdale ’ s home . I took a taxi because I didn ’ t want to be late.But I was the first one __eou__ Cookouts often start slowly . A two o ’ clock start means you arrive any time after two . __eou__ Thanks for telling me this . __eou__ I was late getting back from the mall , but I ’ m hurrying . __eou__ Why are you in such a hurry ? They said , Dinner at eight , and it ’ s only seven-fifteen . I don ’ t want to be the first one there again . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . We won ’ t be the first . __eou__
How did you do in the last quiz ? __eou__ I doubt if I can pass it . __eou__ Don't be so worried , You know Professor Robert is not too strict . __eou__ But I often skip his classes , and he doesn't like me . __eou__ I hope you'll do better in the final . __eou__ I must , if I want to pass the course . __eou__
I am so bored all day . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Jack borrowed a large sum of money from me and didn ’ t pay me back . __eou__ Don ’ t make a mountain out of molehill . I am sure he will do that on his payday . __eou__
Mike has changed much after marriage . __eou__ Yeah . He ’ s almost become a slave , his wife is leading him by the nose . __eou__ It ’ s unbelievable . He used to be such a rough guy . __eou__
Say , Anna , what are you doing tonight ? Would you like to go out ? __eou__ Oh , sorry , I can't . I'm going to work late tonight . I have to finish this report . __eou__ Well , how about tomorrow night ? Are you doing anything then ? __eou__ No , I'm not . What are you planning to do ? __eou__ I'm going to see a musical . Would you like to come ? __eou__ Sure , I'd love to ! But let me pay for the tickets this time . It's my turn . __eou__ All right ! Thanks ! __eou__
Sorry , I overslept . My alarm clock didn't go off this morning . __eou__ Again ? __eou__ That's right , even though I did set the alarm last night . __eou__ Your clock never works . Perhaps you should buy a new one . __eou__ Well . If it breaks down again tomorrow , I'll definitely buy a new one . __eou__ Maybe by then it will be too late . __eou__ What do you mean too late ? __eou__ By that time , you will be fired . __eou__
Do you often go to watch sports games ? __eou__ I go occasionally when there's a game on near home , but usually I watch it on TV . __eou__ Can you recall the games ? __eou__ Sometimes . But I'll never forget the game in which our Chinese Women's Volleyball Team won the World Cup . It is the most thrilling and exciting game I have ever seen . __eou__
How do you like your work ? __eou__ The work is rather hard , but it's interesting . __eou__ What do you do ? __eou__ I work in a publishing house . How about you ? __eou__ Mine isn't hard , but it's not interesting . __eou__ What do you do then ? __eou__ I'm a clerk in a shop . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ I can ’ t find the book I want . __eou__ Why don ’ t you try looking at the database ? __eou__ I checked it already . __eou__ Do we have it available ? __eou__ It wasn ’ t there . __eou__ I guess it is lost . __eou__ Will you be getting another copy ? __eou__ Yes , we will . __eou__ Could you reserve a copy for me ? __eou__ I can do that . __eou__ That ’ s great . Thanks a lot . __eou__
Can you help me figure out how to use this vending machine ? __eou__ Yes , I would be happy to help . What do you want to buy ? __eou__ I want to buy that candy . __eou__ OK . So this machine will make change if you need it . Do you have your dollars ready ? __eou__ Yeah , so far , so good . __eou__ Next , you feed your dollars into the machine in the slot . Make sure they are smooth . __eou__ Yeah , I already knew that . __eou__ I'm sure you know that if the dollar gets stuck , you might have to re-feed it . __eou__ OK , let's move on ! __eou__ Now you just make your selection and pray . If nothing comes out , try again or call the number on the side of the machine . __eou__ I hope it works ! __eou__ Well , good luck ! __eou__
What was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ? __eou__ My husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate . __eou__ Three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive ! __eou__ Well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive . __eou__ Were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ? __eou__ I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood . __eou__ Did your husband's family get to meet your family ? __eou__ My husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed that the wedding party should be less about money and more about family . __eou__ That makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ? __eou__ We waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa . __eou__ You really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ? __eou__ Not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly ! __eou__
Did you read this ? It says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family . __eou__ Why would that be funny ? __eou__ Well , think about it . We are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to , but because we want to . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary . __eou__ I don ’ t agree , but anyways , I think you should start thinking of a new year ’ s resolution yourself . __eou__ What ’ s the point ? We always make a new year ’ s resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it . It ’ s pointless . __eou__ Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives . __eou__ What about you ? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in . __eou__ Well , I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday ! __eou__ Yeah , yeah , whatever . __eou__
How did your vacation go ? __eou__ I traveled the Three Gorges . __eou__ What about the trip ? Do you enjoy yourself ? __eou__ Yes , we had a good time . The trip was terrific . We toured the Three Gorges by boat . Its realty exciting ! __eou__ Did your boat float down the river ? __eou__ Yes . There are many places where the gorge is very narrow , with steep cliffs on both sides . __eou__ Sounds dangerous . __eou__ Yes , but we have life jackets . And we got a real kick out of that . __eou__ What a thrilling trip ! __eou__
What do you think of his behaviour yesterday ? __eou__ He's a sad dog . He came to the wedding in jeans ! __eou__ I don't think so . He only had no common sense . __eou__
They promised us a sea view . __eou__ Well , you can just see the sea . Between the factory chimneys . __eou__ Isn't it awful ? I can't bear to look at it . I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks . __eou__ Well , it can't be helped . We'll just have to put up with it . __eou__
Hello , Mike , long time no see . How's everything going ? __eou__ Not bad . Thank you . You look great today . And how is your husband ? __eou__ He caught a cold yesterday , but he feels much better now . __eou__ Well , I'm glad to hear that . Please give my regards to him . __eou__ I sure will . Thanks . __eou__
Hello ! How are you . __eou__ Not too well ! I ’ m just to the doctor . I haven ’ t been feeling too well over the last few days . __eou__ What have you got ? A cough ? A cold ? __eou__ That ’ s the funny thing . I don ’ t what ’ s wrong with me . I just feel exhausted . __eou__ Perhaps you ’ Ve been working too hard . You do have a high-pressure job . __eou__ Maybe . I haven ’ t been able to keep my food down either . That ’ s unusual . __eou__ Well . I ’ m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . Dr . Jameson is very good . __eou__ Yes , he is . I ’ Ve make an appointment for 10 o ’ clock , so I ’ d better move along . __eou__ OK . Hope you feel better soon . You should take it easy . I ’ m sure the doctor will prescribe rest , you know . __eou__
If you go out recently you will find some people riding scooters in high streets and back lanes . __eou__ Yes . The German engineer would never dreamed that the hand - supported scooter he invented several years ago to solve his traffic problems would become so fashionable in the Occident within a few years and even spread to Japan and China . __eou__ Looking at the ' five sense organs ' of a scooter , it can be said as delicate and agile . To pull the T-shaped pole and make it vertical with the flat board and then pull it vertically , adjust its height suitable to you and you may use it . __eou__ Small and exquisite in size , easy to operate , foldable and easy to carry are its charms . __eou__ Your two hands hold the pole , stand on the board , the other foot steps back against the ground and controls well the balance of the body , then you can ride in the air . It has a feeling of surfing . You need not let other people teach you . Your fear will disappear quickly . __eou__

Let ’ s call it a day . __eou__ It ’ s nice to go home earlier once in a while . But it ’ s the evening rush . __eou__ It ’ s hard to commute a long way . __eou__ Sure it is . I really hate to get caught in a traffic jam . __eou__

What was the movie you saw last night ? __eou__ It was a foreign film called ' Gone with the wind ' . __eou__ Really ? I've seen that movie , too . __eou__ How did you like the movie ? __eou__ I thought it was pretty good . __eou__ I can't say I agree . __eou__ You're kidding . The storyline and acting were outstanding . __eou__ I guess I expected too much from the movie , so I was a bit disappointed . __eou__ It might be . __eou__
Tom , aren ’ t you a little too old to be trick-or - treating ? __eou__ What are you talking about ? Where is your Halloween spirit ? Didn ’ t you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends ? __eou__ Of course , I did , but when I was ten ! Trick - or-treating is for kids , plus , I ’ m sure people will think you ’ re a kidnapper or something , running around with kids NCP at night . __eou__ Whatever , I ’ m going next door I heard Mrs . Robinson is giving out big bags of M & Ms ! __eou__
I hear Yolanda has been studying every night this week for the exam . __eou__ That's good , but I think it's too late . She hasn't studied all semester , and I doubt she can catch up in one week . __eou__

How about the hiking ? It was freezing yesterday , are you all ok ? __eou__ Can ’ t be better , it was wonderful . We had a lot of fun there . There was so much joy and walk and breathe the winter air . We arrived at the park at 9 o ’ clock in the morning and didn ’ t leave till 3 o ’ clock in the afternoon . __eou__ You had been walking for 6 hours , isn ’ t that boring ? __eou__ Of course not ! We built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . We went sliding on the nice hill . It was a real work out . At noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . Fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . You must come with us next time . I bet you will love it . __eou__ Well . You know I hate walking , but I can ’ t wait to see your guys ’ video . __eou__
Do you believe in horoscope fortune-telling ? __eou__ I used to be an atheist . But in recent months , I couldn't but form a more favorable opinion of horoscope . __eou__ That sounds interesting . Have you been involved in any mystery ? __eou__ Not exactly , except that I find horoscope predictions increasingly accurate . I came upon a website which sends me an up-dated message by e-mail each day forecasting my experience in detail . It is amazing to find these forecasts largely in line with my daily life . __eou__ What did it say about you then ? __eou__ For example , the message for the day before yesterday notified me that I , as a Leo guy , was to have some " unusual experience in food and drink . And as it turned out , the reality matched this prediction well . Lasi night , I was treated to a dinner party by Mr . Lee . __eou__ But it must have been only a coincidence . That's the only way superstition wins over science . __eou__ Oh , no . You can never tell whether such-and-such is science or sheer fraud.If horoscope is really something deceptive , how come quite a size of proportion of young people think highly of it . __eou__ For fun . It serves as a shared topic to them.While they claim to consult the predictions constantly and marvel at their " accuracy ' . they do not necessarily take them seriously . When it that these predictions are matched by their real-life experiences , they delight in spreading the thrill with friends . But if there isn't any correlation between reality and predictions , they just grin , forget about them , and go on living as usual . __eou__
Don't have some relation with him . You know , he is not a kind man . __eou__ Yeah . Sometimes I just cannot accept his behavior . __eou__ If you attack him , be sure you ’ ll get a Roland for an Oliver . __eou__ OK , it ’ s better to be far away from him . __eou__
It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah.The autumn is marvelous here . __eou__ How about winter ? __eou__ That's a hard time.The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy . __eou__ It's boring , right ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Do you get much rain during the summer ? __eou__ Plenty.We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area . __eou__ So you should bring an umbrella often . __eou__ That's right . __eou__
You don ’ t look like enjoying this workout . __eou__ I ’ m not crazy about it at all . __eou__ You don ’ t like this sort of exercise ? __eou__ I ’ m not interested in it . Are you keen on it ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s funny . I thought you liked it . __eou__ I hate it . __eou__ Never mind . It ’ ll be over in 10 minutes . __eou__ It ’ s the worst thing I ’ Ve ever tried . __eou__
Hi , Jenny . Are you going to school now ? __eou__ Yup . I have English at 9 in the morning . __eou__ Got any plans after the class ? __eou__ Not really . What about you ? __eou__ We will have our midterm exams next month . I plan to look for some important books and study at the library . Do you want to join me ? __eou__ Sure . I need to return some books . They are due today . Besides , I can also read some weekly publications , magazines and newspapers . __eou__ Great . We can go to the swimming pool in the gymnasium after that . __eou__ That sounds like a good idea . We can chill out a little in such a hot summer . Are you good at swimming ? __eou__ Well , that's a good question . I haven't swum for almost two years . I think I need more practice . __eou__ Oh , it's almost 9 . I need to hurry . I am running late now . See you after class in front of the library then . Bye ! __eou__ See you then . __eou__
Linda , would you care for some candies or cookies ? __eou__ No , don't try to tempt me . I'm becoming chubby , and I have to slender down . __eou__ You are not really chubby . You are actually thin enough . __eou__ I don't think so . I know I've put on weight this winter . __eou__ So you are watching your weight , aren't you ? __eou__ Yes , to tell you the truth . I am on the diet . __eou__
Did you listen to the weather forecast ? __eou__ No . Why ? __eou__ There's a typhoon coming . __eou__ No way ! __eou__ Yep , it should be here by tomorrow night . __eou__
... I knew it . I always knew you were a lesbian ! __eou__ She's my roommate , not my date . The D-man , as in dork . __eou__ Haha . Still got that great sense of humor , I see . Here's my card . I sell used cars . A car from us is a car you can trust ! __eou__ Alrighty then . Didn't you use to date Sheryl ? __eou__ Sweet little lassie . Yep , broke her heart when the D-man told her he couldn't be a one-woman guy . __eou__ Oh ? I heard she dumped you . Anyway , she's right over there . Oh , Sheryl ! __eou__
Which team do you think will emerge with the last laugh in this World Cup ? __eou__ I wish it could be Germany . But it seems they are not in a very good conditions . __eou__ No , they aren't . They had a hard time in the group stage and only sealed a sit in the eighth-finals with Wallack ' s header in the final three minutes . Just think , group A consists of Austria , China , and Saudi Arabia , all of which are minnows . __eou__ It seems they've been out of luck since the beginning of the event . Their shots hit the woodwork as many as six times . Oh . my goodness ! I'm afraid the team is under a spell . __eou__ Well , at least the Germans have demonstrated a very good ability to control the midfield . They recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against Austria . And they to be endowed with perfect positional sense . I think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later . __eou__ I agree . Eeven though German attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders , they breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate , well-timed passes . __eou__ That's why I still have very high hopes for the team . Now that the tournament has proceeded into the knock-out stage , the Germans will probably make it through to the finals . __eou__ Yes . They have a good reputation for their tenacity and discipline , especially in vital , decisive encounters . __eou__
The woman was beaten again . Why didn ’ t she call the police . __eou__ Because it was her husband who beat her . __eou__ It is incredible . __eou__ She said that she didn ’ t want to foul her own nest . __eou__
Are you feeling better today , Bill ? __eou__ Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening . __eou__ You'd better give up smoking . It's bad for your health . __eou__ You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit . __eou__ But you should make up your mind first . __eou__ You know , I often have to work till late at night . I need something to keep me awake . __eou__ Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work . __eou__ Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it . __eou__
I don't know why people are just mad about David Peckham . Is there really anything so fascinating with him ? __eou__ He appeals to the fans thanks to two things __eou__ you mean he plays well ? Yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks . __eou__ Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts . However , a few free k __eou__ In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls . __eou__ yes , his face looks are manly , with a straight nose and infinite eyes . As a man of medium height in the West , he keeps a powerful but elegant figure , looking neither lanky nor stout . __eou__ and he is English ! He makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical British accent . __eou__
What are you reading ? You've had your nose buried in that book since last night . __eou__ This book is so good . I just can't put it down ! It's called ' The Power of One ' . __eou__ I haven't read a book like that for as long as I can remember . __eou__ Me either . From the very first page , this author just pulled me right in ! __eou__ Can I read it when you're finished ? __eou__ Yes . I'm in the last chapter now and it is just gripping . __eou__ Don't tell me anything about it . I want to read it for myself . __eou__ Okay . But be prepared for an all-nighter ! I doubt you will want to put it down either . __eou__
Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ? __eou__ No . I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ? __eou__ Yeah . I worked about 20 hours a week in a pizza restaurant . __eou__ What was that like ? __eou__ It was always very busy there . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I stood behind the register and took pizza orders . __eou__ Did you get any perks on the job ? __eou__ Yeah . I got to eat as much pizza as I could for free . __eou__
May I introduce myself ? I am steven smith . __eou__ Glad to meet you mr smith my name is jenny . __eou__

That looks like an interesting book . __eou__ It is . It ’ s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world , with brief descriptions of how they were build , their purpose , and so on . __eou__ There are the pyramids . It ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though . __eou__ They don ’ t now , but most of them did originally . There ’ s picture of the pentagon in the united states . It ’ s very distinctive with its five sides . __eou__ Look at that cylindrical office building . I ’ Ve never been seen one that shape before . __eou__ Yes . Usually only TV towers are cylindrical in shape . __eou__ TV towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . They ’ re not perfectly cylindrical . __eou__ This is the world ’ s largest sports stadium . It ’ s a massive oval . __eou__ What sports do they play there ? __eou__ It says here that it ’ s m mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings . __eou__ Is that building a perfect cube ? __eou__ According to the book , it is . I ’ Ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . Look at the building . From the air , it looks like a square with a semi-circle attached to each of its four sides . What __eou__ Is says here that it ’ s a war memorial . Now , there ’ s a distinctive structure-the stomium in Brussels . See ? It consists of several connected by cylinders . I believe you can go up and down inside it . __eou__
Hey Bobby . What's going on ? __eou__ Just taking a smoke break . __eou__ I forgot my cigarette today . Do you have another one ? __eou__ Sure . Here you go . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ I didn't know you smoked . __eou__ Really ? I've been smoking for over a year now . __eou__ Oh . You're new to smoking still . I've been smoking for 7 years . __eou__ You ever tried to quit ? __eou__ Many times . I'm really addicted . It's harder to stop than you think . __eou__ Yeah . I tried to quit last month , and I thought it was going to be easy , but it turns out that I'm still smoking . __eou__ I highly recommend you quit soon .

I'll talk to you later . __eou__

What did you do last night ? __eou__ I just stayed at home and watched TV . __eou__ Did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ? __eou__ Yes , it was a very evenly matched game . __eou__ What were the results of the game ? __eou__ It ended in a tie . __eou__ What was the actual score ? __eou__ It was three all . __eou__ Really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid . __eou__ If Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ Their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway . __eou__ That explains it . __eou__ How many more games are left this season ? __eou__ That was the last game before the playoffs . __eou__ When do the playoffs start ? __eou__ In a few weeks .

Thank you for showing me your offices , Mr . Becker . I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . __eou__ Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . Government service can be a rewarding and secure career . __eou__ Do you mean financially rewarding ? __eou__ Well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries . __eou__ I've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy . __eou__ Sometimes that's true , but not usually . Most feds are honest , hard-working professionals . It ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive . __eou__ How much do you make ? __eou__ I'm a GS - 15 . That's high on the scale of workers , but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage . __eou__
I just got fired . __eou__ You asked for it . __eou__
Hello ? __eou__ Hi , Kathy . Have you had lunch ? __eou__ Not yet . And I ’ m really hungry now . __eou__ I ’ m starving , too . There is a new Chinese restaurant close by . Do you want to go there for lunch ? __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ It ’ s my treat this time . __eou__ Thanks . I could eat a cow . __eou__
Would you like to see our new shirts ? __eou__ Sorry , but I ’ m not really interested in those things . __eou__ But they ’ re very nice , you know . __eou__ Really . __eou__ And not expensive either . __eou__ Oh , I don ’ t care about that . __eou__ Everybody is buying them . __eou__ Are they ? __eou__ Yes , they ’ re very fashionable , you see . __eou__ I ’ m afraid I ’ m not interested in fashion . __eou__ I see . __eou__ But thank you very much all the same . __eou__ Sorry , I couldn ’ t help you . __eou__
Hi . What's up ? __eou__ Nothing much . What's new with you ? __eou__ Not too much . I've been pretty busy . __eou__ Me too . Seems like all I do is eat and sleep . __eou__ Gotta go . Call me tonight . __eou__ Okay . Check you later . __eou__
Hey , what sort of drinks do you want ? Gatorade or water ? __eou__ Gatorade . It ’ s rich in Vitamin and it gives us energy and vitality . __eou__ Yes , that ’ s the exact thing we need . One for each . __eou__ What should we do , now with Jack out of the game ? __eou__ We should choose from the backups . __eou__ That ’ s right . Spraining the ankle and breaking the leg are the common things during the match . __eou__ That ’ s why we should learn to protect ourselves . Otherwise , the game is not worth the candle . __eou__ That ’ s for sure . During the back court , we should change the position we played . __eou__ Yes , I played shooting guard , I like shooting and you ’ ll play inside , OK ? __eou__ I agree with you . I think we ’ ll play much better than before . __eou__ Wow , the cheer-section is coming . The music is so fantastic . __eou__ Yeah , look how passionate they are ! Are they professional ? __eou__ Well , you should ask your friend . You know I ’ m not the boss . Just kidding . __eou__ Oops ! I almost forget about it . Do you see the girl in the middle of the first line ? __eou__ Yeah , what ’ s up ? __eou__ Don ’ t you think she looks like your daughter ? __eou__ I also have a doubt . Oh , kill me softly , she is May . __eou__
Welcome to my birthday party , I am so happy you can come . __eou__ Thanks for inviting me . Here is the gift for you . Happy birthday , Francis ! Many more happy and healthy years for you ! __eou__ Thank you , shall I open it now ? __eou__ Yes , please do . __eou__ Wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . I really like it . That is so nice of you . __eou__ Yeah , I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car . It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself . __eou__ Typical you , always wanting to keep the best things for yourself . The more I appreciate the gift now . __eou__
Hi , Mark ! Long time no see ! __eou__ Hi , Alex ! __eou__ Where have you been ? __eou__ I just got back from London . __eou__ How was your flight ? __eou__ It was OK . There was a lot of turbulence , though . __eou__ That ’ s too bad . How long was the flight ? __eou__ It was 10 hours . __eou__ Did you have a layover ? __eou__ Yes , in Paris , France . __eou__ Did you buy anything in the duty-free stores ? __eou__ Yes . I bought two boxed of chocolate – one for me and one for you ! __eou__ Oh , you didn ’ t have to ... __eou__ It was nothing . __eou__
I wish our competition will quit poaching our people , when Susan resigned last week to work for the Sunburst , she was our fourth employee to leave us for them . __eou__ Have you ever considered that perhaps we have a morale problem among our employees ? If everyone is discontent with their work , of course they won't stick arround . __eou__ Well , those do leave will soon find out the grass isn't as green on the other side of sense as they thought it was , I know Sunburst is suffering from inbreeding . __eou__ Inbreeding is a big drawback from snitching most of their employers from one or two companies . __eou__ With Susan leaving , we should probably look to someone new on board . __eou__ Our human resource department is working on it , it's not easy to recruit new employees every few month , it's hard to find qualified people . __eou__ Maybe we should start shopping around the competitors people . __eou__
Do you have a bf ? __eou__ Yes , I had a bf before . __eou__ Why you say bf before ? __eou__ We parted from each other last month . __eou__ Have you got a new one ? __eou__ Mmmm , no . How about you ? __eou__ I am single , I have no real of , only an E-gf , that is you . __eou__ Haha , so you are my E-bf . __eou__ I like you . Do you agree to be my of ? __eou__ Mmmm . .. OK , let's try to be . __eou__ Wow ! Blablablabla . . . __eou__ Hey ! What is it ? __eou__ I am flying like a bird . __eou__ LL __eou__ I am so happy . I want to drink a cup of champagne . __eou__ I have no champagne right now . How about this ? __eou__ It's OK , so I send you this . __eou__ Is it made of chocolate ? __eou__ It's my heart ; it's made of what you like . __eou__ Oh , I will have a sweet dream . __eou__ Are you sleepy ? __eou__ A little bit . I have to go to sleep though I don't want to . __eou__ Yes , I do not want to see ur sleeping in the office . __eou__ Thx.Bye for now . Kisssssssssss . __eou__ C U here , honey . __eou__
Hello , Kevin . __eou__ Oh , hi , Lee . You look great . __eou__ Thanks . You too . __eou__
What's the weather forecast for today ? __eou__ Cloudy in the morning , overcast in the afternoon . __eou__ Any rain ? __eou__ No , but I wouldn't be surprised if it rained tomorrow . __eou__ I wouldn't either . It's been looking like rain for several days . __eou__
Which do you like better , orange or lemon ? __eou__ I like orange better . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because orange is much more to my taste . __eou__
You hurt Ben's feelings . __eou__ So ? __eou__
have you ever seen Bill Gate's home on the internet ? __eou__ no . what's it like ? __eou__ it's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through __eou__ would you want to live there ? __eou__ I think his house is fantastic , but I wouldn't want to live there . You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and pro __eou__ what's your dreamhole like then ? __eou__ my dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quite village in England . __eou__ would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ? __eou__ old homes are great because they've got character . I think that's important . __eou__ it that why you wear second-hand cloths as well ? Because they've got character ? __eou__ no , that's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time ! __eou__ I see . If you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ? __eou__ no , I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state . I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years a __eou__
When I quarrel with my husband . He didn't even try to cool me out . __eou__ It takes two to make a quarrel and it takes two to mend fences . __eou__ I was so angry that I could not keep cool . What I need is just an apology . __eou__
You're just left school , haven't you , Emily ? __eou__ Yes , I finished last Friday . __eou__ You sound relieved . __eou__ Well , yes . I don't mind admitting that I am .

What are we having ? __eou__ I made strawberry shortcake . __eou__ Ooh , that's my favorite . Maybe I'll have a small slice . __eou__ Great . Would you like coffee or tea with that ? __eou__ I'll have a cup of tea . __eou__ Do you take cream or sugar with your tea ? __eou__ Actually , could I have some milk with that ? __eou__ Definitely . Would you like skim or whole milk ? __eou__ Skim , please . That'd be very nice . Thanks ... oh no . Janna , I'm so sorry , but I've got to go . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I just got a message from my sister saying that she's been in a car accident . I need to go pick her up . __eou__ I'll go with you . Where is she ? __eou__ She's on the M40 , near Reading . __eou__ Is she alright ? __eou__ I don't know , she didn't say . I'm so sorry about this . __eou__ Don't worry . Family comes first . Come on , let's go . __eou__ Actually , I've only got a two-seater . I'll have to go on my own . __eou__ Ok . Just call me if you need anything then . __eou__ I will . Thanks a lot . __eou__

Are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ? __eou__ There are a few stories about natural disasters . There is a massive forest fire in Australia . It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers . __eou__ Was it caused accidentally or naturally ? Sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in Australia and Africa . __eou__ Nobody knows at the moment , but it has been very hot there recently . The drought in Africa is causing starvation . Millions of people have migrated to try and find food . __eou__ What is the international community doing to help ? __eou__ The European union has sent several plants with relief supplies . Several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies . Refugee camps have been set up across the region . __eou__ How many countries have been affected ? __eou__ Six have been seriously affected , but the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries . __eou__ I saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in Iran . __eou__ Yes . There have been a few there recently . They say that this one was not a big quake . The Iranians are dealing with it on their own . They have purchased some special equipment to find people buried under rubble . __eou__ Does the newspaper say anything about casualties ? __eou__ So far , less than 20 people have died , but over 100 are in hospital . __eou__
Where are you going for your trip ? __eou__ I think Hebes is a good place . __eou__ But I heard the north of China are experiencing severe sandstorms ! __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , it's said that Hebes was experiencing six degree strong winds . __eou__ How do these storms affect the people who live in these areas ? __eou__ The report said the number of people with respiratory tract infections tended to rise after sandstorms . The sand gets into people's noses and throats and creates irritation . __eou__ It sounds that sandstorms are trouble for everybody ! __eou__ You are quite right . __eou__
hi , how are you doing ? __eou__ everything's great . And you ? __eou__ same here . Have you seen any new films recently ? __eou__ no , I haven't had a chance to . But I've been watching a Chinese TV series called Chinese-Style Divorce . __eou__ oh , really ? I saw it two years ago . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking . __eou__ yeah . I found it is so close to our life . __eou__ it reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world . __eou__ you said it . You know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent years . __eou__ well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend end quickly too . __eou__ I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married . __eou__ oh , that's too short-lived . __eou__ that's true . It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s generation . __eou__ I can't agree more . The only-child generation in China tends to know little about marriage . __eou__ definitely . They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously . __eou__ in their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone . __eou__ I think , as the saying goes as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same thing with marriage . __eou__
We should keep Frank at arm's length . __eou__ Yeah . He's known as a sly dog . He's done many people in . __eou__ He hits below the belt . __eou__ And he may cash in on people whenever chances are provided . __eou__
Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy . __eou__ I don't think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking . __eou__ Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes would do no good . __eou__ No.You can't suddenly make smoking illegal . But the government could prohibit smoking in public places like cinemas and theaters . __eou__

I know I'm a blabbermouth , but what do you think she should do , John ? __eou__ Honey , we're in the museum now . We're not here to discuss your coworker's love life . We're here to enjoy the great paintings by Picasso ! __eou__ I know ! But it's really important to her ! Her whole life could be ruined by this man ! __eou__ You're making a federal case out of it . One unhealthy love affair can't ruin anything . It could even make your life more interesting . __eou__ Are you serious , John ? __eou__ All I'm trying to say is that life is ... like ... er ... this painting . __eou__
Don ’ t you think it would be an idea to name the ship Dolphin ? __eou__ All right , if that would make you happy . __eou__ So you ’ Ve got something on your mind , I guess . __eou__ Well , nothing really serious . __eou__

I see you've already taken six credits of your breadth requirements.You have one botany class and one chemistry class . And political science.So that's nine credits . Did you take English Composition 201 ? __eou__ No , I don't need to . I took Advanced Placement English in high school.So I'm not required to take composition . __eou__ Excellent . I see you have the 18th century poetry class for next semester.And the modern novel class . You haven't taken a Shakespeare class yet . __eou__ No , I thought I would take it later . __eou__ Actually , I recommend you take Shakespeare sooner rather than later . __eou__ Well , I suppose I could cross out the 18th century poetry class . I have to see when the Shakespeare class meets . __eou__ Let me look at the timetable.Shakespeare meets Monday , Wednesday and Friday at 11 __eou__ I can take it then . I have that time slot free . __eou__ Good . I recommend it . Shakespeare is of course enormously important.We want our students to take the class as soon as they can.And Professor Friedman is an excellent teacher . __eou__ I'll take it then . __eou__ Tell me , Lisa , what made you decide to be an English major ? __eou__ I want to be an English professor in the future . I love studying literature , and I want to teach it . __eou__ Really ? That's great to know . __eou__ That's the reason I want to finish my B . A . in four years.Because I know I will be in school a long time . I want to start the M . A . and Ph . D . program as soon as possible . __eou__
hey , Lucas , how was your trip to Paris ? __eou__ it was wonderful , but I was so tired . __eou__ did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower ? __eou__ yes , that was the first thing we did .

However , on the third day of traveling in the city , I felt sick . I think I had something bad to eat , but it passed by the evening . __eou__ yes , you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad . Sometimes new food might disagree with you . __eou__ on the fouth day , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic ! And no stomach problems . __eou__ that is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful . __eou__ you'll have to try for yourself some day . __eou__
Excuse me . __eou__ Yes , Miss , what can I do for you ? __eou__ I ordered my dish about a half an hour ago , but it hasn't arrived yet . __eou__ I'm sorry for that , I'm going to check with the chef right now .

But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well . __eou__ I'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got a partner . __eou__ Thank you for your compliments.It ' s just that you are a good leader . Do you like the fox-trot and tango ? __eou__ Yes . And what dances do you do best ? __eou__ Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's pent-up feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll and the break dance . __eou__ Oh , well , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance . __eou__ My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . __eou__ Fine . __eou__
What's the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ? __eou__ We are going to climb a cliff on the Yangtze River . __eou__ How hard is the climb ? __eou__ It is a very difficult climb , because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . __eou__ What did you do last week ? __eou__ We rappelled down the side of a 300 - foot cliff . It's very exciting . __eou__ Wow . That sounds like a lot of fun . I am sorry I missed it . __eou__ Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb . __eou__ Yeah , I will .

While growing up , I read hundreds of interesting English storybooks every year . __eou__ That's what i did in America . I was reading all the time . I was never a big TV watcher . TV wastes time . __eou__ I agree . Reading for fun is why all the English students at our family school have excellent English . All the students read 800 easy storybooks during their second year of studying English . __eou__ 800 books ? I'm impressed ! __eou__ My aunts studied in the American universities.They say that extensive reading for fun is the most effective way to improve your English.That ' s what they learn here in America . __eou__

We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ’ s a real mess . __eou__ For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ? __eou__ Um ... how can I put this ? Let ’ s just say that at this pace , we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months . __eou__ What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ’ s the bad news ? __eou__ Oh , that ’ s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . We ’ re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ’ re going to have to shoulder this cost . __eou__ Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess ! __eou__ We tried that , sir . The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country . __eou__ We ’ re doomed ! __eou__ There is some really good news though ! __eou__ Really ? What ! __eou__ I got offered a new job ! __eou__

I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now . __eou__ Did you finish typing it yesterday ? __eou__ Yes , I kept on typing it until midnight , but it is lost . __eou__ Don't worry about it .

Where's Bill ? The ambassador is already here . The meeting is set to start at 9 am . __eou__ He's late again . Traffic is probably holding him up . You know , he commutes from the suburbs . It's not easy commuting every day . We should cut him some slack . __eou__ Even though the traffic is bumper-to-bumper out there , I don't think it's heavy traffic that makes Bill late . He takes the train , remember ? __eou__ Oh , that's right . Well , the train shouldn't be late . That means there is only one explanation ... Bill must have overslept . __eou__ Well , to be fare , since he's coming all the way from Lancaster , he's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us . He must get start on his commute about six thirty , no telling what time he actually gets up . __eou__ That's right , because he's got to get to the train station from his house , then take the blue line into the city , then switch trains to the red line . In all , the trip's got to take more than 2 hours . __eou__ Why doesn't he just drive to work ? __eou__ It's too difficult to park your car in the city . Also , the traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare . __eou__
What can I do ? __eou__ Take the books out of the bookcase . Put them in this box . __eou__ Well , the books are in the box . What can I do now ? __eou__ Take the magazines out of the bookcase . Put them in that box . __eou__ All right . __eou__ Peter ! Pack them . Don't read them . __eou__ These magazines are interesting . May I borrow one ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ Thanks , John . __eou__
This is great , isn't it ? __eou__ It's the most fun I've had in years . __eou__ We should do this more often . __eou__ Yes , we should . __eou__
What do you think of his behaviour yesterday ? __eou__ He's a sad dog . He came to the wedding in jeans ! __eou__ I don't think so . He only had no common sense . __eou__
Have we sold out all the newspapers for today ? __eou__ Yes . What a good job we have done ! __eou__ Why are so many extra gifts left here ? __eou__ Many customers didn't want them . __eou__ How about giving them to that old man ? __eou__ Good idea . __eou__ By the way , do you think it's a good idea to give free gifts to attract customers ? __eou__ I'm not sure , but still it did attract a large crowds today . __eou__ I think it should be more useful to hand out some fliers which is also cheaper . __eou__ But people can just throw them into the trash can as they turn around . __eou__ That's true . __eou__ Anyway , let's just finish out job and get back home . __eou__ Okay . How tiring the job is ! __eou__
I'm afraid of the darkness . __eou__ Don't worry . I'll drive you back . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
What's your number ? __eou__ I'm number seven . What about you ? __eou__ Five . __eou__ Hah hah ! You have to go before me . __eou__ You think it's funny . I'm terrified . __eou__ Don't worry . It's safe . __eou__ But I've never jumped off anything in my life . The highest thing I've jumped off is my bed . I'm scared . __eou__ You are the one who wanted to come here , Sandy . You should enjoy it . __eou__ I guess I'm adventuresome , but then I'm scared too . __eou__ I'm not too scared . But I've done sky diving before . __eou__
I think modern painting means nothing . __eou__ I think so too . It's just pointless . __eou__ Then why are so many guys so crazy about it ? __eou__ I don't know . Maybe they're really crazy . __eou__ Maybe . __eou__
Hi ! Dick . Where are you going ? You're in such a hurry . __eou__ Playground . We're having sports for today's outside class activities . All my classmates have already got there . __eou__ What are you going to play ? __eou__ Some of us will play basketball and some volleyball . __eou__ Enjoy yourself . __eou__
Yesterday I had a deal with a vice manager . He acts like the point man . __eou__ I always meet people like him . __eou__
Wow , the view from the peak is so grand ! __eou__ Look , most of the maple leaves have turned red . __eou__ Did you ever see this kind of beautiful scene ? __eou__ Of course , my father used to take me to Kiang Shan or somewhere like that as a child . __eou__ But my father did not . He didn't have much time . __eou__ Honey , I'm sorry . I promise you , this summer vacation , I will take you to Huang-Shan Mountains . It is more beautiful and magnificent . __eou__ Really ? It's a deal . Have you ever been there ? __eou__ Yes , I went there five years ago . You were still a baby at that time . __eou__ It really gets me interested . Is it higher than Kiang Shan ? __eou__ Surely . You can enjoy the beauty of numerous streams and waterfalls . The sea of clouds has a fairy tale beauty . __eou__ Can I see the rainbow ? __eou__ That depends . If you are lucky , you can see a vivid rainbow across over two peaks . __eou__
Tom has grown six inches within a year . __eou__ He has reached puberty . His mind and body both will change a lot . __eou__ Yeah , do you see his Adam's apple ? It becomes bigger . __eou__ Time is flying . I still remember everything when he was a child . __eou__
For our lunch meeting with the investors , do we have to make a reservation at the restaurant or do we just show up ? __eou__ Usually for lunch , we don't have to reserve a table , they should allow walk-ins . But to be on the safe side , I'll order a table for half-past twelve . Will that suit your schedule ? __eou__ I've arranged to meet them at the restaurant at twelve . Can you make the reservation a little earlier ? If we start earlier , it will give us more time for a longer lunch . __eou__ Are you planning on treating the investors to a full-course meal ? __eou__ Yes , we'll start with appetizers , follow with a soup and salad course , then main dishes of prime rib or cordon bleu chicken , and finish up with a delicious rich dessert of some sort . __eou__ That'll be pretty heavy for a mid-day meal , don't you think ? __eou__ As along as we stay away from anything alcoholic , we should be okay . __eou__ With your prime rib and chicken choices , you'd better hope nobody's vegetarian . __eou__ We can make some special arrangement if we need to . After all , it's the company who is footing the bill . __eou__
Too much , Harry . Don't blame her anymore . __eou__ But it was her that makes us so embarrassed . __eou__ I know . But there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ? __eou__ I don't care . __eou__
Hi Jane , can you let me know the best way to get to your house this evening ? __eou__ Certainly , where will you be coming from ? __eou__ I need to be in the city centre this afternoon so I will be coming straight from there . __eou__ Ok . Take the Underground ( the Circle line ) to High Street Kensington . Make sure you take the High Street Kensington exit . __eou__ Got that . __eou__ Ok - when you leave the Underground , cross the road and you should see Horntown Street . Was up that street to the crossroads . As you was you should see a fast food place on your right . __eou__ Hold on , I am looking at the map now . Ok , I can see Horntown Road . Do I go straight at the intersection ? __eou__ No , you need to turn left into Philimore Was and take the next right . __eou__ Ok , I can see that road . __eou__ That's fine . You will not miss it because it's just next to the Kensington centra Library . __eou__ Good , I can see the library on the map . __eou__ Ok , we live in the third building on your left . Will we see you around 7 pm ? __eou__ That's great , see you at seven . __eou__
Guess what came in the mail today ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ My acceptance letter to Yale ! __eou__ Wow ! Congratulation ! When do classes start ? __eou__ Freshman orientation is the last week of august , but I want to go two weeks before that to get settled in . __eou__ You ’ re so lucky ! Do you have to do many things before you leave ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ ll be very busy ! I have to get a visa , buy a plane ticket , and pack my things . But first , I want to register for classes . __eou__ When can you do that ? __eou__ Well , they sent me their prospectus , so I can start looking now . do you want to help me decide which classed to take ? __eou__ Sure . What can you choose from ? __eou__ Well , I have to take all the fundamental course , plus a few from my major . __eou__ What is your major ? __eou__ I hope to major in English literature , but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year , so we ’ ll see . __eou__ What are the fundamental course ? __eou__ In order to graduate , every student must take a certain amount of classes in history , math , English , philosophy , science and art . __eou__ Interesting . That ’ s very different from the Chinese education system . __eou__ Yes , it is . It ’ s also very different from the British education system . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ oh , sure . In British , students don ’ t have to take the foundation course . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ maybe because they think they know everything already ! ha ha . __eou__
Hey John , nice skates . Are they new ? __eou__ Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates . __eou__ What position do you play ? __eou__ I ’ m a defender . It ’ s a lot of fun . You don ’ t have to be able to skate as fast on defense . __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re a pretty big guy . I play goalie , myself . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? Which team ? __eou__ The Rockets . __eou__ Really ? I think we play you guys next week . Well , I have to go to practice . See you later . __eou__ All right , see you later . __eou__

Excuse me . Is there any body here ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I've finished up all my water . I would kill for a sip of water . __eou__ Sure , come on in . __eou__ Thank you very much . Are you here alone ? __eou__ My father and sister are out to photographing . What about you ? __eou__ I'm a back-packer from America . __eou__ What is a back-packer ? __eou__ It means a hiker who loves traveling around the world . __eou__ Cool . You must have been to a lot of places . __eou__ Yes , actually almost half of all the countries over the world . I love traveling places . __eou__ So cool . I want to be a back-packer when I grow up . __eou__ You can do it . But do work hard on your English to make it easier . __eou__ I'll try my best . __eou__
OK , Dead Man . If this doesn't start your engine , nothing will . __eou__ Thank you . Hey , do you know how espresso got its name ? __eou__ No , I don't . __eou__ It's because of the way the steam and boiling water are pressed through the coffee . Es-PRESS-o , get it ? __eou__ Uh , are you sure about that ? I thought espresso was an Italian word . __eou__
Hello ! __eou__ Oh , hi ! __eou__ Please allow me to introduce myself . My name is Tom . __eou__ Pleased to meet you . My name is Alice . Did you just move in next door ? __eou__ Yes , I did . Have you lived here long ? __eou__ Me ? I guess so . I've lived here for about six years now . Have you lived in America very long ? __eou__ No , not really . When I left Vietnam , I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years . Where do you work , Alice ? __eou__ I teach mathematics at a college . What do you do ? __eou__ I am an accountant at a company __eou__ Well , Tom . It's good to meet you . I have to go now . I am teaching a class this evening , and I need to get to the college . __eou__ It's nice meeting you too , Alice . __eou__ See you around ! __eou__ Goodbye , Alice . __eou__
Good morning , Mei ! How are you ? __eou__ Hi Tom ! I'm fine , and you ? __eou__ Not bad thanks . __eou__ Good . See you ! __eou__ Bye ! __eou__
You like movies ? __eou__ Yeah , I think it's the best way to relax . __eou__ What type do you like the best ? __eou__ Really it depends on my mood . When I am sad or depressed , I like comedies . If I'm feeling good , I'll watch almost anything . __eou__ I see . I generally like movies to help calm me down . I think a sign of a good movie is the ability to bring you into the story as if you were part of it . __eou__ Yeah , unfortunately , nowadays directors are often more interested in making money than making a good film . __eou__ True . The movie industry is becoming more and more commercial . You see a lot of expensive movies with little artistic value . I generally think those made in the forties are of higher quality on the average than movies today . You can name a lot of classics from that decade . __eou__ Yeah , many of my all-time-favorites were made in the forties . They've already stood the test of time and will stay with us for a long time . __eou__ I'm totally with you on that . __eou__
What a washing machine ! It ’ s getting worse today . Look ! Now it doesn ’ t work at all . I think I need a new one . __eou__ Here ’ s an ad . about a big sale of washing machine . Do you want to see it ? __eou__ Of course ! Let ’ s have a look . Great ! In my frame of mind , I ’ d like to buy one today . __eou__
Hey , your Chinese is coming along ! __eou__ You think ? __eou__ Yeah . It ’ s a lot better than mine . __eou__ But I still get stuck on the different tones.It drives me crazy . __eou__ Hang in there . It ’ ll all come together one of these days . __eou__
I can ’ t wait to retire . __eou__ And then what ? __eou__ And then I ’ m moving to Florida where I can play golf all day , every day ! __eou__ That sounds boring to me . __eou__ What do you plan on doing after you retire ? __eou__ Yes , I think I will do something new . I ’ Ve always wanted to be a teacher . I ’ m willing to begin studying to teach . __eou__ I admire your energy , Ruth . You are young at heart . __eou__
What colour is her hair ? __eou__ Oh , blonde , she's very blonde ... quite short hair ... __eou__ What , curly ? __eou__ No , not at all . Very straight . Her hair comes down like this ... just over the ears . __eou__ Does she wear glasses ? __eou__ No ... no . I think you're thinking of someone else . __eou__ No . I'm sure I know her . __eou__ Er ... what else can I tell you ? Er ... she's got ... er a ... round face , a very round face , and a very big mouth , sort of wide mouth , when she laughs , her face is all mouth . __eou__ Ah ... No , I can't place her . __eou__
Charles , do you have any children ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ How many children do you have ? __eou__ I have two kids . A boy and a girl . __eou__ What are their names ? __eou__ Jack and Stephanie . __eou__ How old are they ? __eou__ Stephanie is 18 and Jack is 24 . __eou__ Are they in school ? __eou__ Stephanie is . She goes to college in Washington and Jack works in Florida . __eou__ What does Stephanie study ? __eou__ She studies English . __eou__ Is she here now ? __eou__ No , she's at school . __eou__
I can't believe the weather is so gorgeous for your wedding . __eou__ Yes . It's perfect . __eou__ And all of the flowers are in bloom . __eou__ I couldn't have asked for more . __eou__
I was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher . __eou__ Is the math wrong or the way the answer was marked ? __eou__ I think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right . __eou__ These things can happen ; let's double-check the answers first to be sure , all right ? __eou__ That would be great ! __eou__ Look at the answer sheet and compare it to your answers . Do you see any place where I made a mistake in grading ? __eou__ This one right here should be right . __eou__ Yeah , I see the same thing ; now we can do the math and check that , right ? __eou__ Yeah , let's do the math . __eou__ I count all of the correct answers , total them , and divide by the total . Does this look right to you ? __eou__ Looks pretty good . __eou__ Thank you for caring enough to check on your scores ; keep studying ! __eou__
Susan , I haven't seen you in the pub for a long time . __eou__ I have a part-time job now , so I work in the evenings . __eou__ That explains it . __eou__
Mrs . Schmidt ! What's happening ! __eou__ You'll never guess what happened today ! I went to the doctor after work and the doctor told me ... __eou__ And the doctor told you to start listening to Bach ? __eou__ No ... He told me I'm pregnant ! __eou__ Congratulations ! __eou__ And so I bought all these books on having kids and ... __eou__ And they said you should play classical music ? __eou__ How did you know ! They say listening to classical music can make your baby smarter ! __eou__
Guess what ! I know something you don't know ! __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ How many planets are there in the solar system ? __eou__ That's easy . Everyone knows that there are nine . __eou__ Not anymore ! Can you believe it ? They've decided that Pluto is not a planet anymore ! __eou__ Nice try . I wasn't born yesterday , you know . __eou__ I'm dead serious . They've decided that it's too small to be a planet , but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore . __eou__ That sounds crazy . But they can't just change their mind about things like that . __eou__ Yes , they can . If you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat . __eou__ I suppose you're right . They also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them , not the other way around . __eou__ We actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos . __eou__ Do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation ? __eou__ I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way . __eou__ Do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space ? __eou__ I hope not . I think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on the Earth . __eou__ You're so old-fashioned . That's what people used to think about people from another country ! __eou__ Point taken . Hopefully one day , we'll live in an interplanetary society . __eou__
You're just left school , haven't you , Emily ? __eou__ Yes , I finished last Friday . __eou__ You sound relieved . __eou__ Well , yes . I don't mind admitting that I am . I enjoyed school , but I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams . __eou__ Well , what are you going to do now ? Have you made any plans ? __eou__ Yes , I intend to go to university . That'll be in September . But it all depends on my A level results . __eou__ You mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your A level subjects ? __eou__ Oh , yes . __eou__
I noticed your absence in class this morning . __eou__ I'm sorry , I overslept . __eou__
Hello , Jack here . __eou__ Hello , Jack . It's Mary . What are you doing in your office ? __eou__ I am working . I often work late on Thursdays . I am busy this week . __eou__ Would you like to come and have dinner with us on Friday ? __eou__ Tomorrow ? No , I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to . I'm going out of the town on business . __eou__ What about Saturday ? __eou__ Sorry , I never go out on Saturday evening . I always watch football on Saturday evening . __eou__ Will you come round next Tuesday ? __eou__ Next Tuesday ? Just a moment ! It will be the 21st of May . Oh , dear . Arm ... I promised my aunt I would be at her birthday party . __eou__ What do you say to next Wednesday then ? __eou__ Let me see . Yes , Mary . Let's make it next Wednesday . __eou__ Ok . Bye . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
It's snowing outside . __eou__ Oh , how could it be ? __eou__ Let's go out and have a look . __eou__ OK . Wait a minute . __eou__ Look at the snow , it's so beautiful . __eou__ Yes . It's really snowing . __eou__ I love winter , I love snow . __eou__ But don't you think it's a little too cold ? __eou__ But I like cold more than hot . __eou__ You are so interesting . __eou__
How often do you have English lessons ? __eou__ I have a lesson once a week but I try to practice every day . __eou__ How do you practice ? __eou__ I usually look at English language websites every day and go to my local English Corner twice a week . __eou__ Do you ever speak to native speakers of English ? __eou__ Sadly , I hardly ever speak to English people . I usually practice with my Chinese friends . __eou__
What happened to that girl you were seeing ? __eou__ Oh Jackie ? We broke up last week . __eou__ That was a short relationship . You only started dating 2 months ago . __eou__ It was actually a long two months . She was a psycho . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ She would be laughing one moment , and if I said something insensitive , she would start crying . I didn't want to deal with that . __eou__ She sounds very emotional . __eou__ She was a psycho , man . One time we were suppose to get together . I was waiting for her call , and when she finally called , she was screaming why I wasn't at her place . __eou__ Were you suppose to be there ? __eou__ I thought she was going to call when she was done shopping . It was a misunderstanding . She was literally screaming on the phone over this . __eou__ Ok . You're right . She's a psycho . __eou__ I'm just glad it's over . __eou__
Adam . I ’ m sorry . __eou__ Where have you been , Alice , you're over an hour late . __eou__ Yes , But I couldn ’ t help it . I was late getting off work for a start and then I miss the bus . The bus I did catch that stuck in the traffic jam . It was one thing after another . __eou__ why ere you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ Yes . But those are the rush in that moment . And my boss ask me to do some urgent letters . __eou__ Didn ’ t you tell him you have an appointment ? __eou__ Well , no . I thought I ‘ Ve finish in five minutes . and I didn ’ t want to be difficult about just few minutes , if I hadn ’ t been missing the bus and in the traffic I wouldn ’ t have been so late . I ’ m sorry . __eou__ Well . You ’ re here . __eou__
How was the movie last night ? __eou__ I didn't really like it . __eou__ Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography . __eou__ I found it very disappointing . __eou__ She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see . __eou__ I wasn't happy with it . __eou__ Nothing is to your satisfaction . __eou__
I'm busy year in and year out , but now I've done nothing . __eou__ You've done a lot , my darling ! __eou__ I may have done a lot , but none is to my satisfaction . __eou__ You're too strict with yourself . __eou__ Perhaps . I'm dead tired . __eou__
Would you like to come to our party ? __eou__ I'd like to . But I'm not myself today . __eou__ What happened ? You look so pale . __eou__ It's the end of the world for me . __eou__ What makes you say that ? __eou__ Today , I'm told I failed three courses . __eou__ Oh , that's too bad . Work harder next term . __eou__ B :: I'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me . __eou__ Don't lose heart . Everything will be fine . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__
What do you think of the lawyer's speech ? __eou__ He has a glib tongue . Few people can argue him down . __eou__ Don't believe him . He's liar . __eou__ We cannot expect a man like him to speak the truth . __eou__
hey , the new SOHO . How's everything going ? __eou__ everything's great . I've just returned from my office . __eou__ your office ? Aren't you a freelancer ? __eou__ sure I am . I work for myself , but I've rented a virtual office at an office building in the downtown area . __eou__ a virtual office ? __eou__ yeah , an office that runs efficiently by using nothing other than online communication technologies . I pay the rent and share office services with others in the same building . __eou__ what kind of services do they offer ? __eou__ a separated office , internet access , phone services , fax services , mail & courier services , and almost everything you have in a conventional office . __eou__ sounds fun.what else ? __eou__ I get a business address at an expensive location , and I can share the receptionist and secretary with other offices in the same floor . __eou__ oh , that helps a lot to promote your corporate image . __eou__ you bet it ! __eou__
I just love your hair that way . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ Where did you have it done ? __eou__ My sister did it . When did you get yours cut ? __eou__ Just yesterday . I'm still getting used to it . __eou__ Well , it looks very nice . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
That was a great party . Thanks for staying behind to help me clear up . __eou__ It certainly was a great party . It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here . __eou__ I expected that something might get broken . That doesn ’ t bother me . That spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ? __eou__ I doubt it , I'll deal with it right away . Luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , I ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth . __eou__ I ’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag . __eou__ Afterwards , we can do the washing up together . Everything will be finished within an hour . Your friend Keith is really funny . I liked his magic tricks . __eou__ Yes , he ’ s very good .. isn ’ t he ? He told some funny stories too . __eou__ Amanda told some very funny jokes . At the beginning of the party , she was being very serious . __eou__ I think that she had a litter too much of the punch . __eou__ What did you put in that punch ? It tasted great , but was quite strong . __eou__ That ’ s my little secret . Did you like the snacks that I prepared ? __eou__ Very much . The birthday cake was delicious , wasn ’ t it ? Emily told me that she and karen made it themselves . __eou__ That cake tasted so good ! It disappeared within minutes , so I think everyone liked it a lot . How ’ s that stain ? __eou__ All cleaned up . Are you ready to start on the washing up ? __eou__
Mom , this is your third bowl of rice ! __eou__ I know but I have no choice . My stomach just keeps crying for more and more . __eou__ Why ? I never saw you eat so much before . __eou__ I've been going to the gym these days . The exercise makes me hungry all the time . __eou__ So your stomach is the one that actually gets a lot of work-out . __eou__ Don't pull my leg . __eou__ This way you'll probably put on more weight . Will you give up ? __eou__ Surely not . I can feel the results . I'm starting to feel different now . __eou__ Then how are you gonna deal with the problem of getting extra weight ? __eou__ I'm planning to meet my personal trainer to have the work-out plan fixed . __eou__ Oh , I've got an idea . Why don't you ask Dad to go with you ? He badly needs some exercise . __eou__ Your father is a bit too timid . He even doesn't know how to introduce himself . __eou__ He can just say , I'm Benjamin . I'm new and shy . __eou__ Girl , don't make fun of your Daddy . But I can introduce him to my personal trainer . Maybe one day he will be a fitness freak instead of a cough potato . __eou__ Who knows ! __eou__
Look , Bob . This is a photograph I took during my trip to Australia . __eou__ Let me see it , can I ? This is a good photograph . Who are these people ? __eou__ They ’ re people I met during the trip . That ’ s the ship we traveled on . __eou__ What a beautiful ship ! Who ’ s this ? __eou__ That ’ s the man I told you about . Remember ? __eou__ Ah yes . The one who offered you a job in Australia . __eou__ That ’ s right . __eou__ Who ’ s this ? __eou__ Guess ! __eou__ It ’ s not you , is it ? __eou__ That ’ s right . I grew a beard during the trip , but I shaved it off when I came home . __eou__ Why did you shave it off ? __eou__ My wife didn ’ t like it ! __eou__
Hey , Jack ! Is Jenny coming with us ? __eou__ Yes . Why ? __eou__ Nothing . I am just asking . __eou__ Just asking ? ! Why is your face burning like mad ? Ah-huh , someone has a crush on Jenny , doesn't he ? __eou__ Who has a crush ? __eou__ Come on , Ted ! Don't be such a chicken . If you like her , you ’ Ve got to tell her . Maybe she likes you . __eou__ Well , I don't have the guts to ask her out . __eou__ What are you so afraid of ? Just tell her what you are feeling about her . __eou__ I ’ d totally die if she turned me down . __eou__ But that's better than keeping everything to yourself . You ’ Ve got to let her know . Come on ! You ’ Ve got to take a chance . Even though you are rejected , it ’ s not the end of the world . There ’ s nothing to lose , is there ? __eou__ I don't know .. Well , maybe you are right , but how am I gonna tell her ? __eou__
Susan has got the cancer of stomach . __eou__ How terrible ! This is quite unexpected ! __eou__ Yesterday when I went to hospital to see her , you cannot imagine how greatly surprised when I saw her . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ Because of atomic cocktail and other medicines , all of them have the side effect . she has lost all her hair . __eou__
Shall I punch out for you , Ross ? I am leaving now . __eou__ No , thanks . I have got to work overtime . __eou__ But today is Friday . You are not going to work overtime on Friday evening , are you ? __eou__ Well , I am . I'll have to finish this report for next Monday's meeting . Is Tom coming to pick you up ? __eou__ No . We ’ ll meet at my house . He invited my family to spend the weekend with his family at their villa . __eou__ That's nice . Where is his villa ? __eou__ It's not his villa , but his father's . I think it's somewhere in Florida . I am not sure myself . __eou__ Sometimes I envy you a lot . Tom is a good guy . __eou__ Come on . You just haven ’ t met the right person and I think that you work too much . You should learn how to entertain yourself and enjoy life . __eou__ I know , but I am a work maniac . __eou__ Well , suit yourself . I've got to run now . __eou__ Have a nice weekend . __eou__ You too . Oh , I forgot to tell you one thing . A girl called this afternoon . She said she was your ex-girlfriend . She wanted you to call her back . __eou__ Did she mention anything else ? __eou__ No , nothing else . See you Monday . __eou__ See you . __eou__
Are we going to have gym class tomorrow ? __eou__ Are you crazy ? Tomorrow's Saturday . __eou__ Sometimes I forget that we don't have school on Saturdays . __eou__ Americans also don't go to work on Saturdays . __eou__ So there are only five working days in a week ? __eou__ Right . What are you going to do tonight ? __eou__ I'm going to study . __eou__ On a Friday night ? __eou__ Well , I need to polish up my English . __eou__
Thanks a million . __eou__ Don't mention it . __eou__
Jacob , are you interested in helping me out and going on a blind date with a friend of mine ? __eou__ That depends . What does she look like ? __eou__ Well , she's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair . __eou__ How tall is she ? __eou__ She's fairly tall , maybe 2 inches taller than me . __eou__ Is she chubby ? __eou__ Not at all . She's actually very athletic . __eou__ It sounds like she's pretty good-looking . Does she wear glasses ? __eou__ No , but she does wear contact lenses . __eou__ How's her skin ? __eou__ She's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose . __eou__ Does she have any piercings or tattoos ? __eou__ I think she has her ears pierced and she definitely has a few tattoos , one on her lower back , one on her neck , and one on her left foot . __eou__ What's the tattoo on her foot like ? __eou__ It's a butterfly---everyone in her family has one . __eou__ Even her mother ? __eou__ Yes , even her mother . __eou__ What's her personality like ? __eou__ She's a lot like me . __eou__ So there is something wrong with her ! It was beginning to sound like she was too good to be true ! __eou__
Good morning , Jason . How did you sleep ? __eou__ Pretty well , thanks . Still feeling the effects of jet lag a bit , but last night I got at lease six hours of rest . __eou__ Great ! So , are you ready for a full day of shopping ? __eou__ Yep . Let's do it . I'm pretty excited ! __eou__ I know a place that should be perfect . It's called the China Friendship Shopping Center and it's pretty much like an American mall - except with more variety . You can even buy a live chicken there if you want . __eou__ Live chicken ? Thanks , but no thanks . So ... tell me about bargaining . How can I do it like a local ? __eou__ Well . I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person . You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that . But ... if you're smart , you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price . __eou__ Cool ! Teach me ! __eou__ For starters , you want to do a lot of scouting first . You've got to know what things cost . __eou__ Someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs . The idea is that by comparing the prices of those items , you can figure out the relative prices of everything else . __eou__ That could be helpful . But when you go into a shopping center ... prices become very flexible . You have to be able to read the market . __eou__
I ’ m so relieved that your ankle wasn ’ t broken ! I feel just awful about this whole thing . I wanna make it up to you . Let me take you out to dinner tonight . My treat . __eou__ That sounds great ! I ’ d love to ! Here is my address . Pick me up at eight ? __eou__ Perfect ! __eou__ Thank you for such a lovely evening ! The food was amazing , and I had a great time . __eou__ Me too.You look so beautiful tonight ! I wish this night would never end.There ’ s something I have to tell you ... __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day , but I was wrong . A twist of fate brought us together . I crashed into your life and you into mine , and this may sound crazy , but I ’ m falling in love with you , Veronica . __eou__
Hey , you ’ re early ! Where ’ s everyone ? __eou__ Well ... I told them not to come . I made a reservation just for the two of us . I thought we could have an quiet evening all to ourselves . __eou__ Oh ... why ? __eou__ Jennifer , there ’ s something I wanna ask you . __eou__ Sure . What is it ? __eou__ Hmm ... okay , here ’ s the thing . I ’ Ve always seen you as more than just a friend , and I can ’ t take it any more . I know you better than anyone , I know the pros and cons of your personality , I even know what side of the bed is yours ! I think we would be great together , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Are you serious ? We ’ Ve been friends for years ! We can ’ t just change that overnight ! __eou__ I know ! I never had the guts to tell you ... until today . So , what do you say ? Are you willing to give me a shot ? __eou__ I ... I ... __eou__
How do you usually spend your time , now that you ’ Ve retired ? __eou__ Well , I nearly always get up at dawn . I don ’ t like sleeping in late . The days are longer in summer than in winter , so I get up in summer . I usually do some exercise when I get up . __eou__ What do you have for breakfast ? __eou__ I usually have cereal , but sometimes I cook a traditional English breakfast . __eou__ that sounds nice . How do you spend your mornings ? __eou__ I usually do housework in mornings . I go shopping occasionally . I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket . I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center . It takes about 20 minutes to drive there . __eou__ How do you spend your afternoons ? __eou__ I usually meet some friends and we play sports together or I might spend some time alone on my hobbies . I spend winter evening watching tv , but I spend summer evening at cultural events if I have time . __eou__
What do you think of being a secretary ? __eou__ I'm not at all keen on that sort of job.It makes me crazy . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ You have to type all day . __eou__
Hey . Steven . You have a large chunk of money , but why do you still live in the old flat , instead of buying a new villa ? __eou__ I like to live here and enjoy my neighbors ' company . And I don't think I should waste money just because I have much of it . __eou__ But I found you always hate to part with your money . Look at the car you drive ; it's such a junker ! __eou__ Oh , the car is old but still in good condition . I just think we should be thrifty , whether you are rich or not . __eou__ But ... But ... __eou__ But what ? Just remember that thrift is not only a great virtue , but also a great revenue . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__
Judy , have you ever made out how much money shall we spend ? __eou__ Oh , yeah . The total amount is no less than 13,000 RIB , according to our itinerary . __eou__ What ? That's too much . __eou__ Sit down . I'll show you the list of our financial budget . First of all , it is nearly 4,000 RIB that we should spend in transportation . __eou__ Ah , the transportation fee always takes a great part in the budget . __eou__ Then we must pay a large amount of money for the hotel . But if we want to save money , we can choose a hotel which is not so good . __eou__ Hmm , what I'm fearful of is that the accommodation will also deteriorate once we choose a cheaper hotel . __eou__ In that case , we can choose the Youth Hotel . It's a good choice , clean and economic . __eou__
Julia , what do you think of the network ? __eou__ Network is omnipresent nowadays . It's quite convenient for people . You see , we can download music and information from the Internet ; I can study from it , too . And the most of all , we can compose , send , and receive e-mails . __eou__ Yeah , you are right . Internet makes our lives easier . But it's a two-blade sword . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I mean Internet brings benefit a lot , but also some disadvantages . For example , many youngsters are addicted to the games and they neglect their study ; or some bad guys steal people's money online , etc . __eou__ I agree . But I think although it has some negative effects , on the whole Internet does more good to us than harm . __eou__ Yeah , you are right . But we have to know how to make good use of it . __eou__
I'm tired . __eou__ Well , you've been working on this assignment for five hours . __eou__ Yeah , I need to take a break . __eou__
Where are you going ? __eou__ I'll accompany my wife to the hospital . __eou__ What's wrong with her . __eou__ She is expecting . __eou__ Congratulations to you . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Hi , I ’ m Susan.What ’ s your name , please ? __eou__ My name is Zhang Ming.Nice to meet you , Susan . __eou__ Where do you come from ? __eou__ I come from China.Are you American ? __eou__ Yeah , that ’ s right.SO what are you studying ? __eou__ Business management __eou__ That sounds interesting . __eou__
Hi , Alex . How are you doing ? __eou__ Just fine , Karen . I ’ m just taking a breather from all this paper work ! __eou__ I know the feeling . I ’ m calling to let you know about this new Italian place I found . It ’ s right around the corner . __eou__ I ’ ll have to try it . You know how I am about Italian food ! What ’ s the name ? __eou__
Have you figured out where you want to transfer to ? __eou__ I can ’ t think of where to go . __eou__ Where would you like to go to school ? __eou__ I really don ’ t know . __eou__ You can ’ t think of anything ? __eou__ I really like where I ’ m at now . __eou__ So , why don ’ t you just stay here ? __eou__ That may be what I ’ m going to do . __eou__ It ’ s a perfectly good school . __eou__ You ’ re absolutely right . __eou__ Do you know what you ’ re going to do now ? __eou__ I ’ m just going to stay at PCC . __eou__
Those guys thought they would never lose . But we finally beat them . And look at them crying now . __eou__ The bigger they are , the harder they fall . __eou__
I can ’ t believe the cost of apartments in New York City . __eou__ Oh , you didn ’ t know that apartments here are considered valuable , even if they are small and crowded ? __eou__ Of course I had heard about that , but now I know how expensive it is to rent a place here . __eou__ I don ’ t mind paying high rent to live in New York . __eou__ Why ? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live . __eou__ Yeah , but so what ! I ’ m proud to live in the world ’ s most exciting city . And , the salaries here are the highest in the nation , too . __eou__
You see that chick over there ? __eou__ The one in the red shirt ? __eou__ Yeah . Isn't she hot ? __eou__ She's alright . __eou__ Just alright ? ! ? She's hot ! __eou__ Why don't you go talk to her ? __eou__ You think she's out of my league ? __eou__ Hell no ! You're just a chicken that's all . __eou__ C'mon . I get nervous when I talk to girls . __eou__ Why don't you go stand next to her for a while and if an opportunity comes up , strike a conversation . __eou__ What do I talk about ? __eou__ It doesn't matter . You gotta find what she's interested in and go with that . __eou__ I don't know ... __eou__ Do you want me to go talk to her ? __eou__ No . Stay away from her . __eou__ If you don't do anything , I'll bet somebody else will . __eou__ Ok already . I'll try . __eou__
How about a movie tonight ? __eou__ It doesn ’ t matter to me . __eou__ Does 7 o'clock suit you ? __eou__ Either way . I don ’ t care . __eou__ How about a snack after work ? __eou__ I couldn ’ t careless . __eou__ Would you rather stay home ? __eou__ Whatever you say . __eou__ Are you really interested in doing something ? __eou__ I don ’ t mind if you want to . __eou__
Have you ever played Making ? __eou__ Not really , but I know it is very popular a traditional Chinese gambling game . __eou__ Yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . I tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . So I went to watch people play yesterday only to find I was even more confused . I think I have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . Practice makes the master . __eou__ Typical Francis , whether you are at work , or engaged in leisure time activities , you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself . __eou__ It is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active . __eou__
Thank you for showing me your offices , Mr . Becker . I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . __eou__ Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . Government service can be a rewarding and secure career . __eou__ Do you mean financially rewarding ? __eou__ Well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries . __eou__ I ’ Ve always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy . __eou__ Sometimes that ’ s true , but not usually . Most feds are honest , hard-working professionals . It ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive . __eou__ How much do you make ? __eou__ I ’ m a GS - 15 . That ’ s high on the scale of workers , but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage . __eou__
Do you have any idea for this vacation ? __eou__ Why don't we spend this vacation earning our tuition ? __eou__ Oh , yeah , let's try to find some jobs . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Is this Mr.Smith ' s residence ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ My name is Paul.Is Mr.Smith in ? __eou__ Yes , he is . __eou__
Mary , how was your date with John ? __eou__ It ’ s OK . It seems we have a lot in common . __eou__ Oh , really ? That is great news . What does he look like ? __eou__ He is tall and slim , fair-haired . __eou__ Sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? __eou__ He is a nice guy and very considerate . I am impressed with how smart and humorous . __eou__ Oh , it ’ s love at first sight . __eou__
So click here , then up to the top . __eou__ Er ... Hum ... Got it . __eou__ Then open that window.Yeah , that one . __eou__ Right ! __eou__ And that's it . You're done . __eou__ I see what you mean . That was pretty easy after all . __eou__
Sam , we are hard up for the everyday expenses . When can you find a job . __eou__ I'm looking for it , but you see , the market shard for jobs , too . __eou__ You liar , I saw you again in the inn . I bet you don't want to work at all . __eou__
I immigrated here last year . __eou__ What do you do ? __eou__ I am an engineer in a mechanized farm . __eou__
I really should be on my way . __eou__ Oh , not yet . At least have one for the road . __eou__ No , thanks all the same . __eou__ Well , I am sorry you have to leave so early . __eou__ Thank you very much . We really had a good time . __eou__ Well . Thank you for coming . __eou__ So see you . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
I hear your daughter graduated from high school as the valedictorian . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Where is she going to college ? __eou__ She has been admitted to Yale with a scholarship . __eou__ Really ? That's the icing on the cake . Congratulation again ! __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Hey Jackie . What are you doing ? __eou__ Nothing much . I'm just relaxing today . Why ? What's going on ? __eou__ I was thinking about heading to the mall . Do you want to go ? __eou__ Are they having a sale ? __eou__ Yeah . Both Bon and Nordstrom's is having there annual sale . It's a great time to buy some clothes you've been holding out on . __eou__ That sounds great . Where should we meet ? __eou__ I'll meet you in front of Nordstrom's in 30 minutes . __eou__ Sounds good . See you there . __eou__ What do you think about these shoes ? __eou__ They're cute . But do you think you'll wear them much ? __eou__ No . Not really . __eou__ This sweater is so pretty . I love the low neck design . __eou__ I bet it's expensive . __eou__ It's on sale for $ 80 . What do you think ? Should I try it on ? __eou__ For 80 bucks it looks great . Go try it on . __eou__
It ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean . __eou__ Would you like to live in the country ? I ’ m not sure I ’ d like it . __eou__ I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The tow just don ’ t go together . __eou__ I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities . __eou__ People can ’ t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , buy there ’ s more to do . __eou__ I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings . __eou__ I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes . __eou__ The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ’ s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful . __eou__ Just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . There ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . There ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods . __eou__ You ’ re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country ! __eou__
I want to leave the motorbike outdoors . __eou__ Fine , just don't do it at night . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ The cold weather will damage the engine . __eou__
You want to go with him ? __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ Then you must be off your head . He is a real bastard . __eou__
how's it going ? __eou__ I'm in a really good mood , actually . How about you ? __eou__ to be honest , I'm a bit fed up . __eou__ what's wrong ? __eou__ well , my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night , but he never did . __eou__ that's too bad . I'm sure there's a logical explanation for it . Don't be too upset about it . __eou__ the thing is , this isn't the first time he's promised to do something and then didn't . __eou__ I see how that can get a bit annoying . __eou__ a bit ? I'm extremely annoyed that he didn't phone me when he promised me that he would ! He's such a liar . __eou__ so what are you going to do about it ? __eou__ I don't know . I've got mixed feelings about it . On the one hand , I really want to end it with him , but on the other hand , I don't want to be without him . __eou__ what do you think would make you happier ? __eou__ in the long run , I think breaking up with him would make me much happier , but I know that I'll be depressed about it for a few weeks first . __eou__ relationships can be confusing sometimes . __eou__ what would you do if you were me ? __eou__ I'd call him and dump him now ! You deserve better than him ! __eou__
Our philosophy teacher is very humorous . __eou__ I usually have the wrong notion that he's very serious . __eou__ No , not at all.The examples he gives are very interesting . __eou__ No wonder when I pass your room , I always hear your laughter . __eou__
Bonjour ! __eou__ What ? __eou__ I said , Bonjour ! __eou__ What ’ s wrong with you , Ted ? __eou__ I ’ m speaking French . Don ’ t you know anything ? __eou__ What ’ s wrong with speaking English ? __eou__ Well , I just got back from my language school . We have to speak French all day there . No English allowed ! __eou__ What are you doing that for ? __eou__ I ’ m trying to learn new skills . It makes me more qualified for a good job . __eou__ Good for you . __eou__
What have you been up to , Johnny ? __eou__ You know-sweeping , scrubbing , washing , drying , waxing , polishing ... __eou__ Wow , your grandma's really having a field day with you , huh ? __eou__ You got that right ... and my mom's still mad about what we did with the dishes . __eou__ You have all the fun , don't you ? __eou__ Listen , I'd better get back to the grindstone . __eou__ Sure thing , Johnny . Watch out for dishpan hands there , kid ! __eou__
I'm scared that she might not come back . __eou__ No , I don't think she's that strong-minded . __eou__ But she took her luggage away with her . __eou__ She will be back soon.You can wait and see . __eou__
What time do you have ? __eou__ A quarter past five . __eou__ I must be off now . I'm pressed for time . __eou__ See you . __eou__
I really enjoyed tonight's party . Thank you , Sarah . __eou__ You're welcome , Bob . It was nice meeting you . __eou__ Nice meeting you , too . __eou__
My eyes water continuously . Why ? __eou__ Perhaps because of the dirty air . __eou__ What is there in the air ? __eou__ Some poisonous gas . __eou__ I can't believe that the air in this city is so dirty . __eou__ Yes . I think I won't come here again next time . __eou__ So do I . __eou__ We waste a vacation . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__
Who did the stupid thing ? __eou__ Maybe it was Dick . __eou__ I don't think so . Dick has been on the ball and he never does things like that . __eou__ Then it must be a naughty boy who did it . __eou__
Rose , the weekend is coming . Let's discuss what we will do . __eou__ What about going to the zoo on Saturday and to the park on Sunday ? __eou__ Sounds good . But on Saturday there's a football final . __eou__ Then , what shall we do on Sunday . __eou__ Let me see . We can visit the country . We haven't done that for such a long time . __eou__ Good idea . I'll go shopping in one of the department stores nearby . We'll go to the zoo and the park another time . After all , we can put that off . __eou__ OK . __eou__
I haven ’ t met Bob for years . How is he ? __eou__ He has been keeping bach after divorce . __eou__ He would have recovered from the stress and got married again . __eou__ Once bitten , twice shy . He said he would rather keep bach than to live in disgust . __eou__
Daniel , have you ever heard about the wildlife sanctuary ? __eou__ Is that different from this kind of zoo ? __eou__ Yes , of course . __eou__ So tell me about it ! __eou__ There are a lot of wild animals in that place , and also some special rules while visiting . __eou__ Special rules ? __eou__ There , you only have two ways for visiting . __eou__ Details ? __eou__ On their bus or in your own cars , and you won't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Because it is dangerous to get out of the car or bus . You can just imagine how fierce the wild animals can be . __eou__ That makes sense . But that sounds interesting . Is there one in Beijing too ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I prefer to go there next time . __eou__ Yeah , sure , you won't be disappointed . __eou__
What subject do you like best ? __eou__ English is my favorite . __eou__ No wonder your English is so good . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Has the chief accepted our plan ? __eou__ Not yet . I guess we should send Jim along to talk to the chief since he is such an apple polisher . I am sure he can help . __eou__ Let ’ s have a try . __eou__
What are you doing there with your mobile phone ? __eou__ I'm moblogging ! __eou__ Moblogging ? what does that mean ? __eou__ Oh , moblogging is a combination of the word ' mobile ' and ' blogging ' . It's another form of blogging . Users can publish blog entries to the web from a mobile phone or other mobile devices . __eou__ Sounds interesting ! That must be very convenient . __eou__ Yes , you're right . I can blog wherever and whenever I'm on the move . It's especially good when I'm on a business trip and my laptop happens to be away from me . __eou__ How can you do that ? __eou__ Well , if I simply want to write a few words , I'll send it by email or edit it all from the cell phone browser . __eou__ What if you want to publish some photos ? __eou__ Then I'll shoot some pictures , re-size the images and upload them with text descriptions to my blog . __eou__ I see . Moblogging must have done a great favor for habitual bloggers like you . __eou__ You bet it ! __eou__
Wow . Look how polite your son has become . __eou__ Yes . We had a big talk with him , and he has really turned over a new leaf . __eou__
I don't think much of the film . __eou__ But I think it wasn't too bad . __eou__ Really ? Do you like the story ? It's sheer nonsense ! __eou__ It's exaggerated . Actually this sort of thing happens to everyone . __eou__
Excuse me , can you suggest a good book for me to read ? __eou__ Yes , they are all on the shelf . __eou__ Do you have an English-Chinese dictionary ? __eou__ Yes . Here you are . __eou__
So , Karen , what do you do in your free time ? __eou__ Well , I like to play the piano . __eou__ Really ? How long have you been playing piano ? __eou__ About 18 years , I started learning when I was a kid . __eou__ That ’ s really interesting . you have to play for me some time . __eou__ Sure , so , what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ? __eou__ Well , I collect beer mats . I ’ m not sure that counts , though . __eou__
Why are you laughing ? __eou__ I can't help it . __eou__
Well , how was your honeymoon ? __eou__ It was fantastic ! We had such a good time . The only problem was that because it was their high season , we spent hours queuing . __eou__ Peak periods always entail hours of queuing . At least you got a nice tan though ! __eou__ Yes , Florida had great weather while we were there . You look tan , too . Did you go somewhere ? __eou__ My friends and I just got back from Bali . __eou__ Wow ! Bali Islands have some of the best beaches in the world , don't they ? __eou__ Yes , we were lucky . My friend's father owns a resort on one of the islands , so we were able to stay for free . __eou__ Did you go diving while you were there ? __eou__ I took a few diving classes , but I didn't really like it , so I did snorkeling instead ! __eou__ Did you take any pictures in the ocean ? __eou__ I've got quite a few pictures of all different kinds of fish . I'll show them to you next time I see you . __eou__ Have you started planning your christmas vacation yet ? __eou__ We're planning on going skiing in Switzerland . Do you ski ? __eou__ No , but I do like snowboarding . __eou__ Would you like to go skiing with us for christmas ? __eou__ I'll talk to my husband about it ; I'm sure he'll say yes ! He loves Switzerland ! __eou__ It is Europe's spotless land of lakes and mountains ! Let me know as soon as you can so we can get a discount . __eou__
I guess I'd better go now . __eou__ I've got to be going now too . __eou__ In that case , I'll be seeing you . __eou__ See you later . __eou__
I ’ Ve just take out an insurance policy . Are you insured ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I have life insurance and my home and its contents are also insured . __eou__ I took out a life insurance policy and make my wife beneficiary . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . You are a fireman and it can be a dangerous job . __eou__ I need to make sure that my wife will be financially secure if I die . __eou__ I can terminate my life insurance policy when I retire and use the money as a pension . __eou__ That ’ s one of the conditions of my policy too . It covers you if you die before you retire and when you retire . __eou__ Did you have to take a medical before you could take out the policy ? __eou__ Yes , I did . It was one of the conditions of the insurance policy . The insurance company need to assess the risk . __eou__
You look pale , Paul.What ' s wrong ? __eou__ I've got a headache . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that.Anything I can do for you ? __eou__ No , thank you . I'll take an aspirin and see how it goes . __eou__
I can't decide whether to go to university or to get a job . __eou__ Well , if I were you , I'd go on studying . __eou__ But I don't even know what to study . __eou__ If I had chance again , I'd major in English . You're good at language . __eou__ That's what my parents want me to do . __eou__ You should take their advice . They know what's best for you . __eou__ But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun , while I spend all my time doing reading and writing . __eou__ But if you go to university , you'll still have time for fun . __eou__ Hm , what you say makes sense . But you know , I still have to ask my parents for pocket money , and I hate to do so at this age . __eou__ And if you try to find a part-time job , you'll have some money too . __eou__ You're right . Thank you for the advice . __eou__
Let's program your courses , since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction . You transcript indicate that your english background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it . __eou__ How many credits for each course ? __eou__ Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department . __eou__ Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will . __eou__
You mean it shuts off to save energy ? __eou__ Yep . And it breathes , see ! __eou__ It's not breathing ! __eou__ Yes , it is . Look at the little light ! It blinks off and on . __eou__ Jen , it's not alive ... but it does look user-friendly . __eou__ I would look so cool carrying this around ! __eou__
The art critic from the daily chronicle doesn ’ t think much of the max oreo exhibition . He says that the artwork is uninspiring and old fashioned . __eou__ Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . What did you think of it ? __eou__ I liked it . I didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion . __eou__ I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic . He doesn ’ t seem to like anything . Which kinds of paintings do you prefer ? __eou__ I like landscapes and still life . You prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I like painters who use rather than watercolors . The colors appear richer . What do you think ? __eou__ I agree . I prefer oils too . I collect landscapes , but I only have a small collection . You have a small collection of abstract art , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . Good artwork is very expensive nowadays . When I was in china , I bought some calligraphy by famous artists . You should come and see it sometime . __eou__ That would be nice . Can you read the characters ? __eou__ I know what the characters on the paintings mean . I think Chinese characters look very artistic . It ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character . __eou__ I think that ’ s true with any of the fine arts . __eou__
What do you like to do in your spare time ? __eou__ I like taking photos . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , look at the photos I took . __eou__ They are beautiful . You did a good job . __eou__ Thank you for saying so . __eou__ As a matter of fact , you are really a terrific photographer . __eou__
It's quite cold this early morning , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah . It's already December , you know . __eou__ Time sure flies , doesn't it ? __eou__
How did you know ? __eou__ It was a kind of sixth sense . __eou__ Does it happen often ? __eou__ No . __eou__
Paul failed again . __eou__ He'll never do well in mathematics . __eou__ How can we help him ? __eou__ Well , I can't help . __eou__
Hi , Elvin . How are the new programmers I got for you ? __eou__ Stay away from me . __eou__ Are you still mad about your nose ? How is it ? __eou__ I'm serious , Zina . Back off . I have a bottle of pepper spray in my pocket . __eou__ That won't be necessary , Elvin . Look , I want to apologize for your nose . I'm sorry . __eou__ Why are you being so nice to me ? Don't think for a second that I trust you . __eou__
I'm afraid I've got to go . I have another appointment at five . __eou__ Do you ? By the way , could you mail this letter for me as you go through the lobby ? __eou__ No problem . __eou__ Thank you . Come back to my office at the same time tomorrow . I'll have the pictures ready by then . __eou__ I will . __eou__
Are you a smoker ? __eou__ Yes , I'm afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . __eou__ Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? __eou__ No , but my husband smokes twenty or more a day . __eou__ When did you begin to smoke ? __eou__ I had my first cigarette when I was seventeen . __eou__ Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? __eou__ Yes , twice . __eou__
Hey man ! How ’ s it hanging ? __eou__ Hey man ! Everything is just groovy baby ! __eou__ Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday ? I heard it was far out , man ! __eou__ I wanted to , but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block ! I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place . __eou__ Right on , right on ! Well , Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dy-no-mite ! He was low on bread , but Sherry paid for everything . __eou__ Gravy ! Jim is such a jive turkey man . He is always hitting me up for cash . Anyway , you wanna book and go grab some grub ? __eou__ Yeah man , I ’ m starving ! __eou__
Are you a newcomer ? __eou__ Yeah , this is my first visit here . __eou__ You speak good English , though . __eou__ Thanks , but I speak English with a strong German accent . __eou__ But let me tell you , you're doing just fine . I couldn't do half as well as you do when I was learning German.By the way , how long have you been learning English ? __eou__ On and off , for quite a few years . __eou__
That's a very nice pair of glasses . __eou__ Does it really look OK ? __eou__ Yes , and I like the color too . It matches your eyes . __eou__ And I got it on sale . __eou__ That's incredible ! __eou__
I want to take Shield on a date but I don't have much money . __eou__ What does she like to do ? __eou__ She likes to golf , dance , and eat foreign food . __eou__ Hmm . Sounds like she has pretty pricey tastes . __eou__ Well , I really like being with her . __eou__ Have you thought about going Dutch ? __eou__ Dutch , where's that ? __eou__ Not where , what . Dutch means you both pay your own way . __eou__ Oh . I wonder if she'll go for that . __eou__
Do you know his sister ? __eou__ Her name is Laura , isn't it ? __eou__ That's right . __eou__ How old is she ? __eou__ Um ... let me see now , is it 18 or 19 , I can never remember ... 18 ... 19 next birthday . Tthat's it . __eou__ What does she look like ? __eou__ Well ... __eou__ Pretty , is she ? __eou__ Yes ... quite pretty . __eou__
Are you free tomorrow , Sam ? __eou__ Yeah , what's up ? __eou__ I'm going to go hiking . Do you want to join me ? __eou__
I like to stay here . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ People are very kind down your way . You ’ re lucky . __eou__ Yes , do you always gather to welcome new comers ? __eou__ Never . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yeah . People down our way hardly speak to each other . __eou__
You are studying here , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . I have been here for three years . __eou__ Do you like this campus ? __eou__ Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected . __eou__ Oh.It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped . __eou__ I ’ ll just have to put up with it . __eou__
Why don't you go out with Jack ? __eou__ He makes me sick . __eou__
Wow ! What happened to you ? You look sad . __eou__ I just lost my job . My boss just told me . __eou__ That's unbelievable . Why did this happen ? __eou__ I don't understand of myself . It seems they have to save money . __eou__ I cant't believe it . You've worked here for years . __eou__
How can I lose weight , doctor ? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food ? __eou__ Well , Jim . It is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals . __eou__ I never eat breakfast though . __eou__ That's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . You will not run your car without fuel , and yet you won't expect your body to work without food . __eou__ I never thought about it that way . __eou__ I bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch TV or read a book . Then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat . __eou__ Oh doctor , I feel so foolish . __eou__ Well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits . __eou__ I know doctor , thank you so much . __eou__
I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . __eou__ Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . __eou__ That's because your country is more agricultural and has much less industry . __eou__ Yeah , you are right . __eou__ We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution laws have been introduced . __eou__ The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it . __eou__ I think you're right . An international response to this problem is needed . __eou__
Excuse me , can you tell me where I can take a taxi ? This is the first time I have been in England , so I don't know where I can do at all . __eou__ Of course.Don ' t worry . I'll call one for you . __eou__ Thank you very much , by the way , is it quite expensive to take a taxi ? __eou__ Yes , besides it versa according to the distance . __eou__ All right . I only hope to get a skillful driver , and drive me to my stop safe way . __eou__ No problem . __eou__ Thanks a lot , bye bye . __eou__ You are welcome , bye . __eou__
Whose handset sounds so beautiful __eou__ Mine . It's My Heart Will Go On , the theme song of Titanic . Isn't it of strong character ? __eou__ Are you able to compose music ? __eou__ No , not yet . __eou__ Who composed it for your ? __eou__ You needn't ask anyone . You can get on line to search for one . __eou__ Can I get on line to search one , too ? __eou__ Yeah . Web sites provide many melodies for handsets like my ERICSSON . __eou__ What about my SIEMENS ? __eou__ Numerous . It's time that everybody is particular about personality.Find one and change yours . __eou__
I don't know what to do about the people who live in the flat above me ! __eou__ Why ? What are they like ? __eou__ They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep ! __eou__ Have you ever talked to them about it ? __eou__ I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again ! __eou__ What did they say ? __eou__ They both just talk about how great they are all the time . __eou__ They soud like the neighbours from hell ! __eou__ They are ! Besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment . __eou__ I thought you didn't talk to them much . __eou__ I don't , but they talk so loudly that I can hear what they're talking about from my bedroom - and it's not very nice . __eou__ What do the other people in your apartment think about them ? __eou__ Most of my other neighbours are scared of them . __eou__ Maybe you should think about moving . __eou__ I can't afford to move right now . __eou__ Well , perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . Maybe once you get to know them , they'll turn out to be more sensitive . __eou__ I think you're being a bit optimistic . If you met them , you'd understand . __eou__ Well , I don't know what else you could do then . Do you think bribing them with chocolate would work ? __eou__
It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , the autumn is marvelous here . __eou__ Tomorrow will be fine too , I think . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__
Susan , I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend . __eou__ A house warming party ? __eou__ Yes , Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn . __eou__ Congratulations ! That ’ s wonderful . I bet both of you are quite happy . __eou__ Well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate in this area is extremely expensive . __eou__ I understand . That ’ s why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town , far from the city . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea if you can find employment nearby . __eou__ I agree . That ’ s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin . __eou__
Tell me something about your Valentine's Day . __eou__ Ok , on that day , boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate in return . __eou__ So romantic.young people must have lot of fun . __eou__ Yeah , that is what the holiday is for , isn't it ? __eou__
How are you doing , Andrew ? __eou__ Not well . I ’ Ve been feeling pretty lonely lately . __eou__ But you have so many friends ! How could you be lonely ? __eou__ You know what they say'a friend to all is a friend to none ' . I don ’ t feel like I really know any of my friends . In fact , I should probably call them acquaintances , not friends . __eou__ What about me ? I ’ m your friend . __eou__ I know you are , you are my girlfriend . I wish I had a guy friend to hang out with sometimes . __eou__ I know what you mean . I find it difficult to make new friends , too . It ’ s not as easy as it was when we were young , is it ? __eou__ Not at all . __eou__ I ’ Ve made a lot of new friends since I started learning English . Maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . __eou__ What kind of qualities do you look for in a friend ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure . I guess I ’ d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time . __eou__ People who play ultimate Frisbee have a positive attitude ; maybe you should join the ultimate Frisbee club . __eou__ That ’ s a possibility . Thanks ! __eou__
He dresses in plain clothes and drives an old car . Who would know he is the richest man in town ? __eou__ You can't judge a book by its cover . __eou__
Oh , I must have been sitting in the same position too long . My legs have fallen asleep . __eou__ Shift it a little before you get up . __eou__ And I need to stretch my legs now . __eou__
Hey Susan , what are you coming as this year ? __eou__ Coming as ? __eou__ Yeah ... for Halloween ! We have a big office party tomorrow evening . There's a prize for best costume ! __eou__ Um ... I have to confess , I haven't given it much thought . I'm from China and Halloween really isn't celebrated there . __eou__ Really ! You don't have some kind of Chinese ghost festival ? __eou__ Oh ... Sure . We have an entire month ! In traditional Chinese culture , Ghost Month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit . __eou__ Cool ! A whole month ! What do you do during that month ? __eou__ Well , people sometimes set off firecrackers , some people burn paper money as an offering and many people go to a temple to burn incense.Mainly though , you need to feed the ghosts because they're hungry . __eou__ Feed them ? __eou__ Yeah ... we set up tables with food , fruit and drinks and offer that to the hungry ghosts . __eou__ And then later everyone eats the food ? __eou__ Yes ! How did you guess that ? __eou__ It makes sense , right ? Who else is going to eat it ? __eou__ Good Point ! __eou__ But no dressing up like ghosts , right ? __eou__ No ! So ... is Halloween essentially the same thing as ghost month ? __eou__
Hey Annie , who is this picture of ? __eou__ Oh , that's my great , great , great , great , great , great , great grandfather . __eou__ I think you can say your seventh great grandfather ! Cutie ! What's his name ? __eou__ Peter Madsen . A great A if I do say so myself . __eou__ Nice pun . What is it you active about him most ? __eou__ He loved his family and his countrymen and his freedom . __eou__ He looks like a very personable man . __eou__ He was . He was friendly toward and showed concern for everyone he met . __eou__
Does Tom drink a lot ? __eou__ Yes , he does . He often has had one to many . But I advised him not to drink too much , he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table . __eou__ That's a problem . He has sort of Dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything . __eou__
Did you hear ? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business ! __eou__ Are you serious ? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! It disgusts me . __eou__ What are you talking about ? How does it exploit people ? __eou__ Well , to begin with , Gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . People have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . Secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . Women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies . __eou__ Geez ! Now that I think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! Although , I have been to Las Vegas , and I didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that . __eou__ You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . Now excuse me , I have a protest rally to organize ! __eou__
Mr . Rogers ? __eou__ Mr . : Yes ? __eou__ I'm not feeling too well . __eou__ Mr . : Would you like to go to the nurse's ? __eou__ Yes , I would . __eou__ Mr . : Here's a hall pass for it . Do you need someone to walk you there ? __eou__ I can manage on my own . Thanks . __eou__ Mr . : I'll drop by later to check on you . __eou__
Can you give me a ride back home ? __eou__ Sure __eou__
Come on in . I am so glad you are here . We have been expecting you . __eou__ Am I late for the party ? Looks everyone is already here . Hope I didn ’ t miss something interesting . __eou__ No , you are just on time . We haven ’ t really started yet . __eou__ Great , here are some flowers for you . I hope you like them . I was not sure if the color will suit your new apartment . __eou__ Thank you , they ’ re beautiful . You can hang your coat over there . Try this new couch , it is so comfortable . You will love it . Want something to drink , tea , coffee , juice or Cola ? __eou__ Don ’ t bother . I will help myself . __eou__ Make yourself at home . __eou__ It is such a nice place . __eou__ Well , I don ’ t mean to boast but all the designs are done by myself and some colleagues are already trying to copy some of them for their new apartments . Look , they are making photos now of my designed kitchen . __eou__
Have you got any plans for the coming holiday ? __eou__ Yes , I have a very special one . I will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . A friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . I was very interested . So I asked him to get me the application form . Lucky , my application was approved by the manager very soon . __eou__ Volunteer in a zoo ? What specific things will you do ? __eou__ I will help to prepare food , feed animals and clean up . I ’ m very excited about it now . __eou__ It must be a unique experience . I ’ m looking forward to share your story when you come back . __eou__ Ok , I will bring you photos as many as possible . __eou__
He is planning again . __eou__ Yeah . But whatever the planes are , he always has an eye to money . __eou__ That is him . __eou__
Happy birthday , Alice , here is a little something for you . __eou__ Thank you very much , David . It's an excellent birthday gift . __eou__
Mike , did you win the lottery or something ? Why the big smile ? __eou__ I'm so relieved . I just passed the bar exam . __eou__ You did ? That's great ! You must be very happy now ? __eou__ That's an understatement . I'm on cloud nine . I couldn't be any happier . __eou__ Did you tell your parents yet ? __eou__ Not yet . I didn't get a hold of them . I'll try to call them again tonight . __eou__ They're probably going to be so happy . __eou__ I think so . It's turning out to be a great day . __eou__
Where should I park ? __eou__ Do you have a car or motorbike ? __eou__ I drive a scooter __eou__ In that case , you can park either in a student lot or on the street . Are you aware of the marked handicapped spots ? __eou__ No , I haven't seen those spots . __eou__ The handicapped logo with blue means that you are not to park there unless you have a handicapped permit . Will you mostly be parking during the day or the night ? __eou__ I park in the daytime . __eou__ Make sure you pay special attention to the street signs with time limits . Have you noticed those signs ? __eou__ No , I have not seen the signs . __eou__ Pay attention to what the signs tell you in terms of time limits and what days you can park there . Do you know what the curb colors mean ? __eou__ No , I don't know what the curb colors mean . __eou__ Just remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means loading and unloading only . I think you'll be good to go ! __eou__
As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives . __eou__ It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points . __eou__ Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone . __eou__ For instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study . __eou__ That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones . __eou__ Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them . __eou__
We'll miss you while you're studying in the United States . __eou__ Yeah . I'll miss all of you , too . But I'll keep in touch . __eou__
The dinner was really good . It knocked my socks off . __eou__ That's very kind of you to say so . Let's try some after-dinner wines . __eou__ Great . Sweet wines are my favorite . They always make a great finish to a decisions meal . __eou__ Do you prefer brandy or ports . __eou__ Port , please . __eou__ Excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor . __eou__ The port is quite exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ? __eou__ Yes . You always have a good nose for wines . __eou__ Next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine . __eou__ Oh , what's that ? __eou__ It's made from naturally frozen grapes . __eou__ Why not ? It sounds great . __eou__ OK , here's to your health . __eou__ Thanks . Cheers . __eou__ Cheers . __eou__
You seem to be unhappy . What happened ? __eou__ My mother is ill in the hospital . __eou__ What does the doctor say ? __eou__ The disease fails to respond to drugs . __eou__
Good evening , sir . What can I do for you ? __eou__ Bourbon , please . __eou__ How would you like your Bourbon , straight or on the rock ? __eou__ With iced water , please . __eou__ Here you are , sir . Bourbon with iced water . __eou__ Thank you . Now how much do I owe you ? __eou__ The bourbon is 15 dollars plus 10 % service charge . So the total is 16.5 dollars . __eou__ That is OK . Here is 20 dollars and you can keep the change . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__
Jack's been looking unhappy lately . __eou__ His girlfriend broke up with him . __eou__ No wonder ! I'd be unhappy , too . __eou__
I've just got the examination results . I am afraid you haven't passed . __eou__ Oh , no ! I can't have failed . surely ? __eou__ I am afraid so . I am terribly sorry ! __eou__ Whatever am i going to tell me parents . __eou__ Don't worry about that , I am sure they will understand . After all , it was a very difficult exam . __eou__ What am I to do ? __eou__ You can always take it again . __eou__
Three other people started to bid . One called himself Buddhabuyer , so I knew he meant business . I raised my bid twice , but it kept going up . __eou__ How high did the price go ? __eou__ I don't know . I dropped out at $ 250 . __eou__ You didn't watch the end of the auction ? __eou__ No . It wasn't the super bargain I thought it was . __eou__
more and more Chinese are marrying foreigners . __eou__ that's true . But I have a low opinion of those women who go out with foreigners . __eou__ oh , why ? __eou__ I think some Chinese wone marry foreigners for money while others just want to live abroad . There is no true love between them . __eou__ I wouldn't say that's totally true . I've met many happy intercultural couples . __eou__ well , then why aren't there many East-West couples where the man is a Chinese and the woman is a Westerner ? __eou__ I guess it's because the Chinese women are more attractive to Western men . __eou__ or because they are less attractive to to Chinese men . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ you know , usually the woman is in her thirties and she is a left girl . __eou__ a left girl ? What's that ? __eou__ they're called that because they're left behind on the shelf . They're also known by their three H's---high diploma , high salary , and high degree . and they're also known as the three S's — single , __eou__ you have a point here , but I believe some mixed marriages are based on true love . __eou__ that ' for sure but very few . __eou__
Our maths teacher is rather humorous . __eou__ On the contrary , I think he's very serious . __eou__ No , not at all . His examples are really interesting . __eou__ So they're easy to remember . __eou__ Yeah , how about your maths teacher ? __eou__ He's an old antique , very serious . __eou__ Bad luck , Anne . __eou__ Hey ! How about your history teacher ? __eou__ She's another antique . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . __eou__
I enjoy watching Channel 5.They always have films from all over the world . __eou__ How about the languages . __eou__ I can read the subtitles.My set is a huge-screen one . __eou__ That's more convenient . __eou__
Happy birthday , Ann . Many happy returns of the day ! Here is a present for you . __eou__ Thank you , Peter . Come into the dining room . We are going to cut the cake soon . __eou__ Ok , who is that girl ? __eou__ That's Cathy . She is pretty , isn't she ? She likes dancing . Ask her to dance . __eou__ Well , I don't know . __eou__ Don't be afraid . She isn't going to bite you . __eou__ Who is afraid ? I am not afraid . __eou__
How about having a cup of tea with us ? __eou__ All right.That ’ s very nice of you . __eou__ Would you like to go to the cinema with me ? __eou__ I ’ m sorry I can ’ t make it.Thank you anyhow . __eou__
Excuse me , could you tell me where you have got that music book ? __eou__ Certainly . Let me see.Oh , it's on that shelf . __eou__ It's too high . I can't reach it.Could you help me ? __eou__ Of course.Here you are . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
Let's skip The X-files tonight , Fran . Okay ? Just this once ? __eou__ Let me guess . You want to watch the History Channel again ! __eou__ How did you know ! There's a program on ancient Egypt tonight . __eou__ Well , I guess I could tape The X-files and watch it later ... __eou__ Look , it's starting ! __eou__ Mysteries of the Pyramids . Didn't we watch this program last week ? __eou__
Do you feel like going to see Paul and Claire tonight ? __eou__ I'd like that very much . __eou__ How does 7:30 sound ? __eou__ Fine . See you later . __eou__
David , have you watched the 82nd Oscar Awards Ceremony ? Avatar got the Award of Visual Effect . The movie sounds great ! __eou__ You are so old-fashioned . I have already watched it last week in cinema . __eou__ How was it ? __eou__ Its 3D animation is attractive and its colorful scenes are also unforgettable . __eou__ It is said that The Hurt Locker got the Award of Best Picture . What do you think about this ? __eou__ Well , its theme is moving and profound , so from the academic aspect , this is its advantage to win the award . __eou__
Wow ! That's a fantastic movie ! __eou__ Yes . I love it , too . __eou__ Who was the director ? __eou__ I'm not sure , but I think it must be directed by Zhang You . That's typical of him . __eou__
the May holiday is coming up soon . Are you planning on going on vacation ? __eou__ I am . I just went to the travel agent ’ s and picked up these brochures . __eou__ where are you planning on going ? __eou__ I fancy going to Tibet for a few days . Have you ever been there ? __eou__ I went a long time ago , before they built the new train that can take you there . __eou__ would you recommend going there for a few days ? __eou__ personally , I think it ’ d be better to go when you have more time . A few days isn ’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital . __eou__ you ’ re probably right . What do you think about Yangshao ? __eou__ it ’ s a beautiful city , but I think it ’ s become too touristy . How about going to a cosmopolitan city like Shanghai or Hong Kong ? __eou__ I ’ d like to get away from the big city life . __eou__ maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of Beijing . I heard they are very relaxing . __eou__ I guess if I only have a few days , I should probably think about going somewhere that isn ’ t far away . __eou__ since the May holiday is the high season , you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . Here ’ s the phone number . __eou__ thanks ; I ’ ll give them a call later . __eou__
What are you worrying about ? __eou__ I am worrying about my husband . __eou__ Where is he ? Is he in danger ? __eou__ You know , he is a taxi driver . He has to have his eyes peeled all the time when he drives , especially during the rush hour . __eou__
Guess who I saw yesterday ? __eou__ Who ? __eou__ My cousin Monk . Have you seen her lately ? __eou__ Not for a couple of years . What happened to her ? __eou__ Nothing exactly . She's grown into a very attractive young lady . __eou__ Oh , she is . __eou__ You know , her long lovely blond hair and beautiful blue eyes really make her stand out from others . __eou__ Not surprising . I bet she's very tall and slim . __eou__ Yean . Around five feet five inches tall . __eou__
I'd like to talk with you again about what happened . __eou__ Oh , come on . Let's not beat a dead horse . __eou__
What type of movies do you like ? __eou__ I like all sorts of movies , primarily drama and science fiction . __eou__ That's an interesting combination . How about western movies ? __eou__ Western and horror are the two types of movies I don't care for . __eou__ Why don't you like horror ? They're entertaining . __eou__ Some are entertaining , but I find most of them stupid and childish . For example , I don't understand why a person always goes into the house alone when something is suspicious . __eou__ Ha ha . I know what you mean . But it's just a movie . They need for the characters to do that . __eou__
Well , you seem to enjoy speaking English . __eou__ You can't help learning when you're using it all day . You'll see . A few weeks'study in the school will have a similar effect on you . __eou__ I hope so . You see , at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent . I'm awfully worried , I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect . __eou__ Oh , she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class . She doesn't mind your making mistakes , though . __eou__ You know , speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use . __eou__
Hey , your Chinese is coming along ! __eou__ You think ? __eou__ Yeah . It ’ s a lot better than mine . __eou__ But I still get stuck on the different tones . It drives me crazy . __eou__ Hang in there . It ’ ll all come together one of these days . __eou__
Tom , you're my good friend , right ? __eou__ Sure . What's the matter with you ? __eou__ The exam ! The terrible exam ! I'm not ready yet . Can you tell me how to get good marks ? __eou__ Don't be so nervous ! Relax ! First , sleep early at night . Second , study two hours a day after school . Third , don't tire yourself out , but don't be lazy . Will that help ? __eou__ Yes , thank you . __eou__
Alison , would you like to have some more ? __eou__ No thanks . I've had enough . __eou__ Actually you haven't had much . __eou__ To tell you the truth , I am on the diet . __eou__ That sounds ridiculous . Why ? __eou__ Well , I am gaining weight these days , and I have to watch my calories . __eou__
I feel that Bob ’ s father-in-law is a hard nut to crack . __eou__ You have taken words out of my mouth . He is a tough customer . __eou__ But his daughter is a very nice girl . __eou__
Look ! There are playing The Matrix today . __eou__ You are right , look at the crowd . Do you think we will be able to get tickets ? __eou__ I don't know . If we can't , we can buy from ticket scalpers . __eou__ No way . I'd rather go to another movie house . __eou__ Come on . We are already here . Besides , I really wanna see this picture . __eou__ All right . Let's see when the next movie is playing ? __eou__ Seven thirty . There is only 10 minutes left and look at the long line ! __eou__ Shall we take a chance ? __eou__ Yeah , let's do so . __eou__ It's moving so slow . __eou__ What can you expect with this crowd ? I am praying that no one will cut in the line . __eou__ I don't think anyone will . __eou__ I hope not . We are getting closer .. two more ... one more ... it's our turn . __eou__
Don't cover up your sadness . Let it go . __eou__ I'm sorry . __eou__ It isn't your fault . No one will blame you . __eou__ You are so thoughtful . __eou__
I've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . I wonder how you managed to achieve such success ? __eou__ Oh , through a lot of hard work , of course . __eou__ I suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it ? __eou__ Surely it was , especially when you only knew few people and little English . __eou__ You mean you didn't know much English then ? __eou__ Right . I only knew a few English sentences . __eou__ That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ? __eou__ First , I worked as a servant . __eou__ Really ? I wish you could tell me more about your experience . __eou__ I'd like to , but I must run to a meeting . __eou__
Hey , Mike . Can I ask you something ? __eou__ Sure , what's up ? __eou__ I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . Who do you think will win ? __eou__ Good question . I have to think about it . __eou__ My husband is betting on France . __eou__ France ? Is he crazy ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , how can I put this ? France is a terrible team . __eou__
Good afternoon , sir . You are really a regular customer here . May I ask you why you come here so often ? __eou__ I'm a newspaper columnist . I write comments for a living . I enjoy working in a coffeehouse . __eou__ I see . But isn't it a bit too noisy ? __eou__ I don't mind . By contrast , I quite like the circumstances , as I can see a variety of people here , who can always give me tremendous inspiration . And the most important thing is coffee as it is my life . __eou__ I can see that . Then what is your favorite coffee ? __eou__ Irish coffee is my favorite . But I can drink any other . I'm not particular on it . __eou__ All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ? __eou__ Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee . __eou__ I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient . __eou__ Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world ? __eou__ Which country makes the best coffee in the world ? __eou__ Many people think Brazil makes the best coffee . Brazil exports a lot of coffee . But I love Irish coffee . So it's hard to say . Just depends on your taste . __eou__ I agree . I heard in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ? __eou__ Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee . __eou__ No , we don't , especially the old people . But more and more young people fall for coffee . __eou__ I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffeehouses in China now . __eou__
Why are there still so many people overweight despite the current fitness craze ? __eou__ Well , there are certain factors that effect people's size and weight . __eou__ What are they ? __eou__ One study said that low-income groups have a higher percentage of over-weight people than higher income families . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ The survey said that the low , income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis . __eou__ That makes sense . Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper . __eou__ And junk food contains lots of fat and oil . There is one final reason why so many people are fat . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Nobody exercises any more-not even kids ! The average American home has the TV on for 6 hours a day ! __eou__ Wow ! No wonder people are so fat . Say , Carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising . __eou__ Yeah , I guess so . __eou__ You should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise . __eou__ Hey , I started a diet and lost 10 pounds . __eou__ So what happened ? __eou__ Well , I quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds . __eou__ You should have kept trying . __eou__
Merry Christmas , Lily . __eou__ The same to you , Joey . __eou__ This is your first Christmas in the US . Here is the gift for you . __eou__ It's very thoughtful of you . Wow , it is so beautiful . Could you tell me how American people celebrate Christmas ? __eou__ Ok . People decorate their houses , place a Christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a Christmas carol together . __eou__
Hey , Cindy , I'm so sorry about yesterday . I shouldn't have yelled at you in front of everyone . __eou__ Don't worry about it . __eou__ I don't know what happened to me . I just lost it . __eou__ I think you just need to get more sleep . __eou__ Yeah , you're right . Good night . __eou__
Jack and Mary broke up . __eou__ it ’ s so sad . They had been together for only two months . Do you know what the matter was ? __eou__ Mary said Jack was cheating on her . Jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . One day , Mary saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately . __eou__ really ? I ’ m very surprised . He doesn ’ t look like a guy who ’ d ever do that sort of thing , right ? __eou__ no , he doesn ’ t . Anyway , she found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time . __eou__ maybe it is for the best . They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people . __eou__ how so ? __eou__ he is an extrovert while she is an introvert . He likes parties while she hates them . __eou__ poor Mary ! She really liked him . __eou__ anyway , she was right to end things and she deserves better . __eou__ do you think they ’ ll get back together ? __eou__ no , I don ’ t think so . I know Mary . Once she makes a decision , she won ’ t change her mind . __eou__ I hope she ’ ll recover soon . __eou__ so do I . __eou__
Look , my clothes are wet . __eou__ Mine are wet , too . __eou__ Unexpectedly , a girl threw a bucket of water on me . __eou__ She wished good luck to you . __eou__ The Dai people are enthusiastic . __eou__ Yes . __eou__
Did you hear about Bob and Mary ? __eou__ No , what happened ? __eou__ They had an argument and split up . __eou__ Really , what's going to happen now ? __eou__
Nick ! How ’ s it going ? __eou__ Oh , hey ... __eou__ What are you doing in this neighbourhood ? Do you live around here ? __eou__ Actually , my office is right around the corner . __eou__ It was great to meet you last week at the conference . I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment . __eou__ Yeah , yeah , it was really interesting . You know , I'm in a bit of a hurry , but here ’ s my card . We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion . __eou__ Sure , you still have my contact details , right ? __eou__ You know what , this is really embarrassing , but your name has just slipped my mind . Can you remind me ? __eou__ Sure , my name is Ana Ferris . Don ’ t worry about it . it happens to me all the time . I ’ m terrible with names too . __eou__

As you know , the winner will move on to the finals . __eou__ That ’ s right , and it looks like we ’ re just about ready to start the match .

Federal gets checked hard into the boards ! __eou__ Maurice Richard has the puck now , and passes it to the center . He shoots ! Wow what a save by the goalie ! __eou__ Alright , the puck is back in play now . Pavel Bure is on a breakaway ! He is flying down the ice ! The defenders can ’ t keep up ! Slap shot ! He scores __eou__ What an amazing goal ! __eou__
What's the matter , Lisa ? You don't look too good . __eou__ I just found out that my husband is cheating on me . __eou__ You mean Mark ? He seems like such an honest guy . __eou__ That's what I thought . It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months . __eou__ Two months ? How did you find out ? __eou__ I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark . She then asked if I was his sister , and I said no , I was his wife . She hung up immediately . __eou__ So you asked him about the girl who called ? __eou__ Yeah , he first said it was someone from work . He gave me a lame excuse , and so I pressed him on it . __eou__ What'd he do ? __eou__ He kept trying to make stupid excuses , and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion . __eou__
What channel did you watch last night ? __eou__ Channel 24.It shows some cable networks and no commercial interruptions . __eou__ You did ? How do you like the fashion show ? __eou__ It was very good . I followed it right to the end . __eou__

Hello baseball fans , and welcome back to today ’ s game ! My name is Rick Fields and of course , I am here , once again , with the man that seals the deal , Bob Copeland . __eou__ It ’ s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions . __eou__ Well , the national anthem has just been sung , and the umpire has started the game . It ’ s time to play ball ! __eou__ Roger Vargas is up at bat . The pitcher winds up and strike one ! __eou__ A very nice curve ball by the pitcher . The catcher gives him the sign , he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive ! __eou__ The players are scrambling to get the ball . Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going ! The outfielder throws it to second ! Vargas slides ! He ’ s safe ! __eou__ Great play ! __eou__ We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okapi ! There ’ s the pitch , he hits it !

Anyway . Thank you , Mike . __eou__
I told you that she is no fool . __eou__ I know she is quite an article , but I was not sure of her ability to cope with a boss . __eou__ She cannot get in Dutch with him . He is her boss , you know . __eou__ But most bosses are fools for woman . __eou__
Hey , Ann , I am really sorry about last night . I shouldn't have said those things to you . __eou__ I am sorry too . I know we've been talking about this beach trip for a while . I should have told Bob I was busy this weekend . __eou__ don't be silly . You guys should spend as much time together as you can . Besides we can go to the beach anytime . __eou__ thanks for understanding . __eou__ well that's what being friends is about , isn't it ? __eou__ hey , what if the three of us go to the beach together ? Besides , you and Bob haven't seen each other for a while . I don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers . __eou__ Nah , I wouldn't worry about that . But I don't want to be the third wheel . You two should have some quiet time to yourselves . __eou__ I know Bob won't mind . You can bring a date , like that guy from the bar you keep talking about . __eou__ maybe ... I'll think about it . __eou__

I am trying to decide what school to apply to ? __eou__ Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ? __eou__ I am not sure . What's the difference between them ? __eou__ Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere . __eou__ Which is better ? __eou__ One isn't necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers . __eou__ I hear you have to wear uniforms at private schools . __eou__ Yes , sometimes . __eou__
Let's program your courses , since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction.You transcript indicate that your english background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it . __eou__ How many credits for each course ? __eou__ Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department . __eou__ Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will . __eou__

You can't lose all your money.because you won't gamble all your money . __eou__ I guess you're right . __eou__ Of course I'm right . I already told you the rule for Las Vegas . Remember ? __eou__ Yes , I remember.You must decide how much money you will gamble before you start to play . __eou__ That's right . That's the best way to have control over yourself.You say to yourself . Tonight I will gamble fifty dollars . Only fifty dollars . No more.If you follow the rule , you can't lose more than fifty dollars . __eou__ I know it's true , Sandy . But still some people lose control.They start to gamble , and they can't stop . __eou__ But I won't let you do that . I will watch you . __eou__ Okay . __eou__ So how much do you want to gamble ? __eou__ Maybe 500 dollars . __eou__ 500 dollars ! That's too much ! You just said you are afraid to lose your money.If you're afraid , why do you want to gamble 500 dollars ? __eou__ I don't want people to think I'm stingy . __eou__ That is a bad attitude to have , Karen ! If you think that way , Las Vegas will be really dangerous for you . __eou__
I feel very miserable . I took the death of my wife very hard , you know . __eou__ Cheer up ! Let bygones be bygones . __eou__ I ’ Ve tried it , not a chance . __eou__ It seems you have to take time . __eou__

Have you ever run into a person who tries to bleed you white ? __eou__ I am always on the look out for such girls . __eou__ I hear that some guys splash all their money about on them . __eou__ Mark is one of them . He has trouble with a girl who turned out to be a dead beat . __eou__
I ’ m sure it will be wet when we arrive . __eou__ Yes . I dare say it will be . __eou__ It will be Sunday so I expected everything will be closed . __eou__ No . I don ’ t think that ’ s possible . Some places are sure to be open . __eou__ But the bank should be closed so we shouldn't to be able to get some money . __eou__ Mmm , you may be right . __eou__ Do you think we ’ ll need our overcoats ? __eou__ No . We couldn ’ t possibly . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ It will be summer . So it will be hot . __eou__ Is that very likely in England ? __eou__ Yes . It could happen . __eou__
My disposable contact lenses . They're great for camping ! __eou__ Cool ! Each contact comes in its own saline solution ? __eou__ Yep . They're prescription contacts with UV protection . __eou__ Wow ! How high-class ... a new pair for each day ... __eou__ You just pop'em in in the morning , take them out at night , and then throw them away . No cleaning ! __eou__ Cool . So are you near-sighted or far-sighted ? __eou__ Near sighted . __eou__
hey , Mary , what's up ? __eou__ not much . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight . __eou__ oh , that's exciting . What's this guy like ? Is he hot ? __eou__ well , I didn't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found his extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! We have so much in common . We like the same teams , music , a __eou__ it seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? __eou__ there's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have radar h __eou__ well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you as me what I value most in a friend , I would have to say honesty . __eou__ I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . __eou__ yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . __eou__
Are you studying here ? __eou__ Yes , I am studying in Eastern Asian language department . __eou__ What are you major in ? __eou__ I major in Japanese . __eou__ What do you think of the literature course . __eou__ It's very helpful.the course has let me into a world of literature . i read so many great literatures . __eou__
Look at the cloud . __eou__ It's going to rain . __eou__ Let's go quickly . __eou__
you haven't spent much time with Sophia lately . Are you speaking to each other at the moment ? __eou__ no , we're not . We've been drifting apart for a while . __eou__ but you two used to do everything together . I thought you really enjoyed each other's company . __eou__ we did , but since she started her new job , all she does is hang out with her new friends from work . __eou__ can't you hang out with them , too ? __eou__ I could , but all they ever talk about is work , so I always end up feeling left out . __eou__ maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you . __eou__ I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her . __eou__ it can't be that bad . She was always a really good friend to you . __eou__ you're right . She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore . __eou__ she's probably just excited about her new job . You should give her some time . It would be a shame to lose such a good friend . __eou__ I've given her enough time . I'm over it now . __eou__ I still think you two should try to patch things up . __eou__ I think I just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways . __eou__
Do you like flowers ? __eou__ Of course , I like flowers . __eou__ What's your favorite flower ? __eou__ I like peach blossom , because I like spring . __eou__ Peach blossom is really beautiful . __eou__ Yes . How about you ? __eou__ I like lotus . __eou__ You have a perfect taste ! __eou__ But there aren't any lotus now . __eou__ Yes . It's snowing outside . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms . __eou__ That's not bad . Let's go . __eou__
Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from Canada . __eou__
There's a double feature at the cinema this Saturday . Do you want to go with me ? __eou__ What are the movies that are playing ? __eou__ There's an action movie with Harrison Ford and a chick flick with Susan Abandon . __eou__ I've never seen a movie I don't like that had Harrison Ford in it . __eou__ So , is that a yes ? __eou__ Yes . What time does it start and do you want to meet me there ? __eou__ It starts at one and yea , let's meet there . It's the cinema on the corner of Lincoln and Main . __eou__ Great ! I have a coupon for free popcorn at that theater ! __eou__
Did you hear what's going on downtown today ? All the orders from the factory are staging a demonstration in the streets . Not one of the two thousand employees showed up for work today , and they have gathered outside the city hall to demand better working conditions for all factory employees . __eou__ Wow , sounds chaotic ... two thousand people in the streets carrying picket signs and shouting slogans . What gave them the motivation to finally organize and call management on the substandard working conditions ? __eou__ I think they gained courage after the mayor's speech last week on equality and opportunity for all town citizens . Anyway , the sentiments have been brewing for quite some time . I mean , we all know the working conditions at the factory are quite horrendous . __eou__ So what kind of demands do they have ? What are they asking for specifically ? __eou__ They want raises and medical insurance , and I think they want to clean up the factory's safety hazards . That's probably the most important issue . __eou__
Hi , Peter . I ’ m afraid I can ’ t make it to dinner tomorrow night . __eou__ Oh , why not ? __eou__ It ’ s just I ’ m not feeling well . I think I ’ m coming down with a cold or something . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry to hear that . Hey , don ’ t worry about the dinner . We ’ ll do it some other time . But you take care of yourself . __eou__ Thanks . I will . __eou__
Why do you want to spend your summer days in a mountain village ? __eou__ I think a mountain village is splendid ! __eou__ I don't agree with you . It's too small to live . __eou__ It has fresh air , and it is nicer than a big town . __eou__ I disagree , a big town is more lively . __eou__ But I like the small mountain village . The big town is noisy . How charming it is when walking along the hill ! __eou__ Well , alright , I agree with you about that , but I still prefer a big town . __eou__
It's getting late , and I have to go now . __eou__ We're sorry you have to leave . __eou__ Please excuse me , won't you ? __eou__ Certainly . Come back soon . __eou__
what's your opinion about childless couples ? Will you choose to have no kids ? __eou__ to be honest , I wouldn't . __eou__ why ? Do you have to make a choice now ? __eou__ not really . But it has puzzled me for a long time . __eou__ what's the puzzle ? __eou__ my husband and I prefer to have no kids , but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids . __eou__ oh , I see . I think the older generation tend to think in a different way . __eou__ yes . It seems she can never accept a childless marriage . We had a fight last night . __eou__ oh , really ? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren . __eou__ but it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not . __eou__ definitely . __eou__ you know , I often overhear our neighbor , the young couple , fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness . __eou__ don't worry . I think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together . __eou__ I guess you're right . But I still prefer to have no child . __eou__ sure . You can fully enjoy your time together . __eou__
I've had enough of that ! __eou__ Why , this is the most interesting film ! __eou__ I hate the hero.He ' s too cruel . __eou__ But it's only a film . __eou__
How much did you bid ? __eou__ Eighty-five dollars . If my bid is the highest after three more days , I win ! It's fun ! __eou__ We'll see how much fun it is after they take all your money ! ! __eou__ But they won't ! I checked the seller's history , and he got good reviews from other buyers . __eou__ What if he had his friends fake the reviews ? __eou__ You are so paranoid ! Not everybody is a crook , you know . __eou__
It's taking you forever to do my hair . __eou__ Give me a minute . __eou__ You should've been done already . __eou__ There you go . __eou__ I don't think that you're done . __eou__ What's wrong ? __eou__ My hair looks hideous . __eou__ What's so bad about it ? __eou__ It doesn't look good at all . __eou__ Sorry about that . __eou__ I really hope that you didn't expect me to pay you for this . __eou__ Well , let me talk to my manager , okay ? __eou__
Excuse me ! I don't have time to waste . I've been here almost one full hour ! __eou__ Sorry , madam . You have to wait your turn . The parking lot is full . __eou__ Unbelievable ! Parking in this city is such a nightmare ! __eou__ Madam , patience is a virtue . __eou__ Oh , gosh ! I have to go to the restroom so bad ! I can't bear it anymore ! __eou__ I'm sure a spot will open up soon . __eou__ Oh , look ! There's a spot open next to the public restroom ! Can I take it ? __eou__
What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! __eou__ I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . __eou__ I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! __eou__ I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? __eou__ I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go . __eou__ Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . __eou__ I have plenty of gas . __eou__ Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze . __eou__ So what can we do ? __eou__ Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible . __eou__ Alright . That's a good idea . __eou__ I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . __eou__ Days ? __eou__ Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . __eou__ Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . __eou__ Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again . __eou__ Okay , I'll follow your advice . __eou__
let's go out for a walk . __eou__ I don't really feel like a walk . __eou__ Well , shall we go to the cinema ? __eou__ All right.That sounds more interesting . __eou__
Mr . Bellow , have you anything in mind as to what to drink or may I make a few suggestions ? __eou__ I have had enough gin fizz and bloody mary . But I have no idea about Chinese cocktails . __eou__ Would you prefer our cocktail — Shanghai cocktail ? It's a mixture of real Chinese ingredients . __eou__ That ’ s good . __eou__ ( The waiter makes the cocktail for Mr . Bellow and hands into him . ) Here is your Shanghai cocktail , Mr . Bellow . __eou__ Thank you . Oh , it tastes excellent . __eou__
Jack I hear you have a chance to go to college without taking a test . Is that right ? __eou__ The news goes so fast . Ah , yes , I haven't decided yet . __eou__ Don't hesitate . That's a very famous university which a lot of students are longing to attain . __eou__ Maybe you are right . But the major is not fit for me . I like architecture more than computers . __eou__ But this chance is really precious . __eou__ Well , I know . So I am thinking now . __eou__ I hope you can make a clever choice . Anyway , the opportunities around you are not that By . __eou__ Thank you for your kindness . I will think about it carefully . __eou__
Hi , Janice . Our first weekend after being employed is coming . Show me your plan . __eou__ My mom phoned me this morning , and asked me to go back home to have housework chores . __eou__ What are you assigned to do ? __eou__ God knows . Speaking of chores , I would rather do some washing than cooking . __eou__ For me , I think I will iron my shirt and trousers . Actually , weekends tend to be the most hectic day in the whole week . __eou__ I really hope that I could sleep like a log all through two nights . But ... Some one said that weekends are a bit like rainbows ; they look good from a distance but disappear before we get up close to them . __eou__ I couldn't agree more . __eou__
Hurry up . We're going to be late . __eou__ I am hurrying . __eou__ What are you doing ? __eou__ I can't figure out which dress to wear . __eou__
So , did I tell you about my New Year ’ s resolution ? I ’ Ve decided to go on a diet . __eou__ And you ’ re going to completely transform your eating habits , right ? __eou__ Exactly ! I ’ m going to cut out all that junk I eat . no more chips , no more soda , no more fried food . __eou__ I ’ Ve heard this one before . __eou__ But this time I ’ m going to stick to it . I really mean it ! Trust me , Carol , I ’ m going to be a new man in one year ’ s time ! __eou__ Well , I guess we ’ ll just have to wait and see . __eou__ Thanks , honey , that was a great meal . I ’ m stuffed . Do we have any chips left ? __eou__
Will you be joining Billy and I at the Bar ? __eou__ Which one will you be going to ? __eou__ We are going to try the new one that opened up on 17th Street . __eou__ Sure , I've been meaning to visit that place myself . __eou__ I want to stop off at my apartment to get changed so I should be there by 9 pm . __eou__ OK , can I bring a date with me ? __eou__ Certainly . But if there are going to be four of us , I had better make reservations . __eou__ Yes . that is a very good idea . It would be a shame if we could not find a place to sit . __eou__ Then I'II make reservations for 9 pm for a party of four . __eou__ I'll be there . Oh , is there a cover charge at the bar ? __eou__ Not that I know of . Why do you ask ? __eou__ I want to make sure I bring enough money for my date and I . __eou__ I hear the drinks and food there are moderately priced.You should be fine . __eou__ One last question.Is there a dress code there ? __eou__ No , its very casual there . Leave your jacket and tie at home . __eou__ Perfect . I wanted to have a casual evening tonight . __eou__ I'll see you there at 9pm . __eou__ Okay . See you then . __eou__
What's the most popular sport in your country ? __eou__ Table tennis . __eou__ Do you play table tennis ? __eou__ Not really , but I like watching . __eou__
I've really enjoyed your party , Lisa . __eou__ Not at all , Sam . __eou__ I wish I could stay longer , but I must be going . __eou__
It's snowing heavily . __eou__ It is very common in the winter in Ottawa . __eou__ The snow is so beautiful . __eou__
Give me Scotch , please . __eou__ What brand ? __eou__ Black Rose . __eou__ Soda or water ? __eou__ Just plain water with plenty of ice rock . __eou__ All right . Please wait for a minute . __eou__
Have you ever seen Bill Gate's home on the internet ? __eou__ No . what's it like ? __eou__ It's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through a remote control . It's also located near the sea , so he can park his boats next to his house . It's absolutely amazing ! __eou__ Would you want to live there ? __eou__ I think his house is fantastic , but I wouldn't want to live there . You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and probably an au pair or two to take care of the children . It's just too big of a place to take care of on your own . __eou__ What's your dreamhole like then ? __eou__ My dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quiet village in England . __eou__ Would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ? __eou__ Old homes are great because they've got character . I think that's important . __eou__ Is that why you wear second-hand clothes as well ? Because they've got character ? __eou__ No , that's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time ! __eou__ I see . If you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ? __eou__ No , I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state . I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years ago would be a great way to feed my imagination even more ! __eou__
Rachel , do you like music ? __eou__ Of course . I can't live without it , so I always bring my CD with me no matter where I go . __eou__ What kind of music do you like best ? __eou__ Light music and classic music . __eou__ Really ? I can't believe this . I am also keen on classic music . And do you know there is a concert of classic music tomorrow evening ? __eou__ But I didn't get the ticket . And it is said that they were sold out yesterday . __eou__ I got two . We can go there together . __eou__ Amazing ! I can imagine the feeling when I hear the smooth tune around my ears . __eou__
Look at what you have done . All thumbs . __eou__ I ’ m so sorry , and I will pay much attention to it later . __eou__
What is your hobby ? __eou__ I spend most of my spare time reading . And I subscribe to various newspapers , magazines and periodicals . __eou__ What kind of reading materials do you like best ? __eou__ I am interested in science fiction . __eou__
You look great ! __eou__ Thanks to you . I'm totally pumped up . __eou__ So you are happy that you made the decision to join us . __eou__ I surely am . But still there is one single problem . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ I eat more and more these days . And it puts even more weight on me . __eou__ It's not good to start with too much work-out at the beginning . What about trying something else ? __eou__ I'd love to do that . What do you recommend ? __eou__ More and more people are warm up to Yoga these days . Do you want to have a try ? __eou__ Do you think it's a good option for health and relaxation ? __eou__ Absolutely . But it takes great perseverance to master . __eou__ I can so that . __eou__ Here is a free class going on right over there . Go and join them . __eou__ How did it go ? __eou__ Everything was okay when it started , but the music made me drowsy . So I think I may have dozed off for a minute over there . __eou__
Do you have to leave soon ? __eou__ No . Actually I can stay longer . Dave called to say that there is a beautiful Chinese girl who ’ s going to pick me up at the school gate tonight at ten thirty instead of eight thirty . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s better . So you don ’ t have to rush . __eou__ Yeah . You know what Dave just said ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ He said I should put on something very nice , because this girl will be my next target . __eou__ He knows you very well . __eou__ He always makes fun of me . He always says things like that . You know the new coming teacher , a Chinese Canadian . He said she would really be my chance . __eou__ I ’ m sure you have chances everywhere . You ’ re handsome , talkative , and got a sense of humor . You must be very popular . __eou__ No , you ’ re kidding . I ’ m not taking it seriously . __eou__
This small town has many serious problems . __eou__ What's the cause ? __eou__ The mayor and high official practice crony is mand a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions . __eou__ I see why it lags behind other towns . __eou__
Do you see the woman ? Is she a teacher ? __eou__ Yes , she is . __eou__ Does she teach Chinese ? __eou__ No , she is an English teacher . __eou__ And who ’ s the man in the green beside her ? __eou__ You mean the man wearing jeans ? He ’ s her little brother . __eou__
which countries have you been to ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been to most of the countries in Europe , several countries in asia , china , Japan , korea , and Thailand , and to the united states and Canada . __eou__ I thought you had been to Australia too . __eou__ no , but I ’ m planning on visiting Australia and New Zealand soon . I ’ Ve heard that they are beautiful countries . Which is the most beautiful country you ’ Ve been to ? __eou__ I think I'd say Norway . It has many pictures as fjords , waterfalls , and mountains . __eou__ isn ’ t it really cold there ? __eou__ well , the north of Norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . It ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter . __eou__ I ’ Ve been to other Scandinavian countries , but not to Norway . Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there . __eou__
What's bothering that guy ? __eou__ Nothing . He's just got a chip on the shoulder . __eou__
Jane , I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon . __eou__ A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ? __eou__ There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , I was hoping you ' d like to come with me . __eou__ I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day . __eou__ What about sunday ? __eou__ I wish I could , but it's my mums birthday . __eou__ Maybe next week . __eou__ Much as I ' d like to , I am afraid i wont be free next week , I have a lot of work . __eou__ Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat . __eou__ I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime . __eou__
Hello , Mrs Turnbull . How are you ? __eou__ Fine , thanks . How's your boy , Jack ? __eou__ He's a bit tired . You know , he goes to school at eight o'clock every morning.He doesn't get home till after four . then he does his homework after tea . It often takes him a couple of hours to finish __eou__ Poor boy . They work hard at school nowadays , don't they ? Does he like it ? __eou__ School , you mean ? Yes , he does . He likes his teachers , and that always makes difference . __eou__ Yes , it does . Does he go to school by bus ? __eou__ No , he walks . He likes walking . He meets some of his friends at the corner another go together . __eou__ What does he do when it rains ? __eou__ My husband takes him in the car . He passes the school on the way to the office . __eou__
Are you an American ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Why don't you speak English ? __eou__ Oh , my mother is a German , so I can speak German . __eou__ Oh , do you like Chinese ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm eager to learn Chinese , but it is too difficult for me . __eou__ I want to study German . Can we exchange lessons ? __eou__ Very Good . I'd like to do that . __eou__ When will we begin ? __eou__ How about tomorrow night ? __eou__ That's all right . __eou__
Your muscles are a spectacle ! __eou__ Thank you.That ' s the result of exercise.By the way , do you work out ? __eou__ No , but I am starting working out from now on . __eou__ Fine . __eou__
You are an eager beaver . __eou__ Thank you . I just consider working as part of my life . __eou__
I visited the famous variety show host , Dennis . __eou__ What's he like ? __eou__ Oh , he's a very serious person . __eou__ You must feel very uneasy at his home . __eou__
Lily , do you know Lizzy ? __eou__ Lizzy who ? __eou__ Lizzy smith . __eou__ Of course I do . __eou__ Then , Do you know her younger sister ? __eou__ You mean Mary ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Sure . I know her elder sister Sue and younger sister Mary . __eou__ Oh , not bad . Then do you know her mother ? __eou__ Yes , certainly . I know her mother and father , and brother and sisters , too . __eou__ That sounds terrific . __eou__ Why do you ask me these questions ? __eou__ I just want to visit the family some day . __eou__
This place serves good breakfasts , don't you think ? __eou__ Yes . But I'm not used to eating American-style breakfast . __eou__ What are you planning to do today ? __eou__ I saw yesterday that they rent windsurfers at the beach . I want to rent one . __eou__ Have you done windsurfing before ? __eou__ No , but it looks fun . I always wanted to try it . __eou__ Can you take a little advice from a friend ? __eou__ Sure . What ? __eou__ Don't waste your money . Windsurfing is very hard . And it will be windy today.They will charge you fifty dollars for a half-hour , and you won't be able to windsurf.You will fall and fall and fall . __eou__ But I always wanted to try it . __eou__ Yes , but it takes a long time to learn.You would spend a thousand dollars to learn it on a rental windsurfer . __eou__ Well , I will see . How was your day at the office ? __eou__
I don ’ t know what I ’ m going to do ! It ’ s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job ! __eou__ Don ’ t worry . I don't think you ’ re going to lose your job over one mistake . __eou__ It was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , one small mistake can cost the company millions . __eou__ But it wasn ’ t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do . __eou__ That ’ s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ’ s nothing I can do about that . My boss won ’ t believe me if I tell him the truth . __eou__ Let ’ s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ? __eou__ I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ’ d rather invest my money somehow . __eou__ Well , you can't have everything . Let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job . When is your contract up on your apartment ? __eou__ Next month . So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year . __eou__ Well , that ’ s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money . __eou__ That ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work . __eou__ If you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ’ ll save plenty of money . __eou__ I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing ! __eou__
Excuse me , I need your assistance . __eou__ Sure , what's up ? __eou__ I have no idea where my class is . __eou__ Tell me which building it's in . __eou__ My class is in the C building . __eou__ I know where the C building is . __eou__ Do you mind telling me where it is ? __eou__ Of course , which room number is it ? __eou__ Number 261 . __eou__ I actually have a class right around there . __eou__ Can you please show me ? __eou__ I can do that . __eou__
I'm more worried about snipers . __eou__ Snipers ? __eou__ Sniping is when someone makes a bid at the very last minute to steal something for a bargain price . __eou__ So you're afraid someone is going to snipe your Buddha ? __eou__ I heard about a software program called turbid . It automatically submits a bid with just a few seconds to go in an auction . __eou__ Count me out . I can do without shills and snipers and turbo-bidders . __eou__
So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown . __eou__ That ’ s cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ? __eou__ I ’ m planning on living with my parents . Won ’ t you ? __eou__ I couldn ’ t even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then ’ d have to find my own place . __eou__ You mean they ’ re kicking you out ? __eou__ Not really , they just don ’ t want me living at home . My older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out . __eou__ Well , it ’ s not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it ’ s ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so . __eou__ My parents just didn ’ t handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . They think that it ’ s important that I should learn how to live on my own . __eou__ I know I need to learn that myself , but I just don ’ t have the money for it at the moment . Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place . __eou__
Hi , Mel , would you like to come and have a cup of coffee this afternoon ? __eou__ I ’ d love to , but you know I ’ Ve got another appointment . I ’ m really sorry . __eou__ I see . Then what about tomorrow , at Starbucks ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid not , George . You gotta know something , I ’ m not available any more . but I know Becky has a crush on ya . __eou__ Are you kidding me ? Becky ? She ’ s a real bitch . __eou__
Ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ? __eou__ Well , we have the Thompsons , the Greens , and the Anderson , about twelve people total . __eou__ Don't forget my friend Andy from the office . He has nothing to do on Friday , so I invited him over . __eou__ But that makes thirteen people ! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! __eou__ Why can't we ? __eou__ It's an old superstition . If we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . Can Andy bring a date ? __eou__ I'm not sure . He just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon . __eou__ But we can't have thirteen for dinner ! __eou__ I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill . It's only a superstition . It really doesn't mean anything . __eou__ Absolutely not ! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! __eou__ Ok , ok . I'll ask my sister to come . That way we'll have fourteen for dinner . __eou__ That's better . __eou__
I can't believe it , I had faith in Bob and he let me down . __eou__ I know what you mean . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , he did the same to me . __eou__
Hello , Alice . Would you like to go to the temple fair with me ? __eou__ Temple fair ? __eou__ Yes . The ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth , and they have developed into a festival filled with food , performances and games now . __eou__ Sounds interesting ! __eou__ Absolutely , I love temple fairs . Beijing has several temple fairs recently . They are different from each other to some extent , but also have a lot in common . __eou__ I just can't wait to see them . Which one do you choose today ? __eou__ What about Tianqiao Temple Fair ? A variety of opera performances , acrobatics shows , and food will dazzle you . __eou__ Great ! Do you know how to get there ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ Couldn't be better . __eou__
Excuse me , Supen . __eou__ I hope nothing is wrong . __eou__ Please forgive me , but I have to leave . I feel terrible . but ... __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ My daughter isn't feeling well . __eou__ Oh , no . Is it serious ? __eou__ I don't know . Will you forgive me ? __eou__ Of course . I'm sorry for your daughter . __eou__ Thank you . It's our first date . I hope it's not too offensive . __eou__ Not at all . __eou__
Hello . Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I hope so . I would like to register for Comp Lit 287 . __eou__ I'm sorry , but that class is already full.And also , students are supposed to register through the touch-tone registration system . __eou__ I know . I already tried to register for it by phone , but the computer won't let me . __eou__ That's because it's full . __eou__ But I'm a new student here . I thought maybe there was some way I could get into the class . I thought I should come and talk to you in the department office . __eou__ Well , I could put you on a waiting list.But that doesn't guarantee you will get into the class . What is your name ? __eou__ My name is Karen Huang . That's spelled H - U - A - N - G . __eou__ Alright . And what is your major ? __eou__ I'm a comparative literature major . __eou__ Wait a minute . You're a Comp Lit major ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . __eou__ Why didn't you tell me ? I didn't know you were one of our students . __eou__ That's why I'm trying to get into Comp Lit 287 . I know it's a required class.And Professor Cohen told me I need to take it . __eou__ The university computer system saves extra places , in class 287 for comp lit students . I can give you a special code.When you register by phone , you can use the code to get into the class . __eou__ Even if the class is full ? __eou__ That's right . __eou__ Oh , I didn't know that . __eou__ Sure . Here is the code number , with information on how to use it . __eou__ Thank you . So you think I will be able to get in with this ? __eou__ Sure . Just call the touch-tone registration system again.Then , follow the directions on the sheet . You will get in no problem . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ Next time you come in here , I will recognize you . __eou__
Who's that man over there talking to James ? __eou__ Where ? Oh , that's Henry . __eou__ He's very handsome , isn't he ? What's he like ? __eou__ He's very nice , actually , but rather eccentric . __eou__ Really ? I love eccentric people . __eou__ Yes , but he may be too eccentric even for you . __eou__ Why ? What do you mean by that ? __eou__ Well , haven't you heard ? __eou__ Heard what ? No one ever tells me anything . __eou__ Well , apparently , he's been having an affair with his secretary . __eou__ Really ! How fascinating . __eou__ According to Mary , he's divorcing his wife and there's a big fight going on about the children . I thought everyone knew . __eou__ Well , what can I say ? I didn't know . Oh , I meant to tell you earlier , your blouse doesn't really match your skirt . Those colors don't really suit you either . __eou__ Oh . Thanks . Look , I must just go and say hello to someone . I'll be right back . __eou__
How did you first meet Jack each other ? __eou__ That is a heavy raining afternoon . I was standing under the eaves of a shop to evade the heavy rain . It's getting dark . __eou__ And then ? __eou__ I was trembling in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked , ' Where is your home ? ' __eou__ Then he sent you to your home ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ It's a romantic meeting . I can say that a hero saves a beauty . __eou__ He joked later that I was so poor that he had a kind of impulse to protect an ant . __eou__ He is so humorous . __eou__
Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from Germany . __eou__ So you speak German , don't you ? __eou__ Yeah , but I can speak English , too . __eou__ Oh , I see . What other languages can you speak ? __eou__ A little French . __eou__ Good . __eou__
What are you reading ? __eou__ Gee ! You scared me ! __eou__ Aha , Fitness Consultant . Very good , Don't you know about the rules in this office ? __eou__ Yes , Ma'am . No magazines during the office hours . I'm sorry . __eou__ Well , don't do this again next time . What is it about , anyway ? __eou__ It is about sports for white-collar workers , people like you and me . __eou__ What kind of sports ? __eou__ Aerobic sports , for example , jogging , yoga , skating ... __eou__ Interesting . What were you reading just now ? __eou__ Stretching exercise after sitting a long time . __eou__ Really ? That sounds interesting ! __eou__ Can I have my magazine back now ? __eou__ No . It's confiscated for now . And I will return it to you after I finish reading it . __eou__

S . ? __eou__ No , I didn't . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ Do you like NBA ? __eou__ Yes , of course . __eou__ Who do you like best of the NBA players ? __eou__ Kobe . __eou__ So do I . __eou__ Let's go to watch an NBA game tonight , shall we ? __eou__ That's fine . __eou__

Where is it ? __eou__ It's right past that last building on the left . Do you want me to go with you ? __eou__ That would be great . __eou__ Glad you asked me to join you . This will be fun ! __eou__
I'm reading an interesting report on Mars . __eou__ Oh , what does it say ? Does it say water could still exist under the surface of Mars ? __eou__ Absolutely ! It says there is water on Mars buried beneath the surface . It's just a matter of how deep it is . __eou__ Then could the soil on Mars somehow be fertile enough to Groh simple plants ? __eou__ The soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything . And it would need to be protected from the UV radiation . __eou__ Actually , we are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on Mars for an extended period of time . Does NASA have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet ? __eou__ I'm not sure NASA has built any portable habitats for extended stays on Mars , but they have looked at various designs . __eou__ One of the most exciting things about Mars is that there could have bean life on it . What are your personal opinions on the life on Mars theory ? __eou__ Well , I'm not really an expert in this area , but my understanding is that anything is possible . It's just that it is so hard to determine what went on 4.5 billion years ago . __eou__ But maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of Mars so it may be inhabitable by humans . __eou__ I'm skeptical . Mars is made of rocks containing silicon , iron , and various minerals . It also has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide . It is so different from what we have on earth , you know . __eou__ I'd still like to hope that some day we could set up a human colony there . __eou__ But there are still other big problems we need to solve such as prolonged weightlessness , food storage , and a series of physiological effects . __eou__
Would you like to go sightseeing tomorrow ? __eou__ Not a bad idea . __eou__ What would you like to see in Beijing ? __eou__ Well , let ’ s see . I ’ d like to go to see the Summer Palace . __eou__ I ’ ll pick you up here tomorrow . __eou__

We need to start loading the buses half an hour early , so plan to arrive at 7 . __eou__ Yes , I will be there on time . __eou__ We will return 6 days later on December 8th . Will someone be picking you up ? __eou__ Yes , someone is coming to get me . __eou__ The return bus will leave the campground at 5 p . m . and return to campus 3 hours later at 8 p . m . __eou__ What should we bring with us ? __eou__ I am going to post all of that information on the geology club web page . Check it out when you get a chance . See you Monday ! __eou__
Mr . : Hello , Mary . __eou__ Hi . __eou__ Mr . : I'm Mr . Taylor , and I'm your counselor . I'm going to show you around the school . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Mr . : Right here is the cafeteria . __eou__ It's huge ! __eou__ Mr . : But not big enough . And here is our computer room . __eou__ There must be about 50 computers in here . __eou__ Mr . : And over here is our gymnasium . __eou__ Do I have to take gym ? __eou__ Mr . : Just like everyone else . __eou__
Oh , my ! It's really hot . I've never seen such scorching weather in my life . __eou__ Tell me about it ! It's like the whole world is broiling . __eou__ Oh , look at the thermometer ! The temperature has hit 98 . __eou__ I hope it's not gonna break into three digits __eou__ But it's already awfully close . __eou__ Well , I just hope it'll level off . __eou__ I guess you can ’ t do anything until after dark then . __eou__ I guess so . What else can we do ? You can ’ t stay in the heat for long . __eou__
In the discus throw , you scored 30 meters at the final throw . How did you make it ? __eou__ Well , I've been practising for 5 weeks . __eou__ Is this your best score ? __eou__ No , once I did 32 . __eou__
Hi , where have you been ? __eou__ I was away for my vacation . __eou__ Oh , how was it ? __eou__ Good . I wish I could have another vacation . __eou__
do you want to go out for dinner tonight ? __eou__ sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ? __eou__ I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions . __eou__ that Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ? __eou__ I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy . __eou__ if you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ? __eou__ I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy . __eou__ you're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us . __eou__ the Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food . __eou__ the Taj it is then . __eou__ shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ? __eou__ they'll still charge us a corkage fee . __eou__ that's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway . __eou__ don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight . __eou__ are you sure ? We could go Dutch . __eou__ no , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time . __eou__ I won't argue with that ! Let's go ! __eou__
Robin , what are you going to do tomorrow ? __eou__ Bob and I plan to play hockey in the morning . __eou__ And later ? __eou__ Well , in the afternoon , after a long nap , we ’ ll go yachting with Nora . __eou__ It seems that you will have a nice day tomorrow . __eou__ How about you ? What are you going to do tomorrow ? __eou__ I have a lot of work in the office and a lot of chores in the house.How I envy you , Robin ! __eou__
So do you think I can take it ? __eou__ I ’ d stay over there , if I were in your shoes . __eou__ I know , but things are getting a bit out of hand and I just can ’ t do nothing . __eou__ See your problem ? You get so restless when it ’ s time to calm down . __eou__ You ’ re right . __eou__
You married Joe , didn't you ? __eou__ Joe ? I don't know what you mean . __eou__ I remember you are in love . __eou__ Oh , I took a shine to him when we met for the first time . But it comes and goes . __eou__ It's Greek to me . __eou__
Watch out , Patrick ! __eou__ Whew ! Thanks , Karen . That car almost hit me . __eou__
Well , humans could never make something like that . __eou__ Those poor Egyptians slaves worked so hard and you want to give aliens all the credit ! __eou__ Be a little more open-minded , Stu ! Don't believe everything you read in your history books ! __eou__ OK , but don't believe everything you see on The X-files , either ! __eou__ Speaking of The X-files , it's on right now ! __eou__
Hi . are you new here ? __eou__ Yes . I moved here last week . __eou__ I'm Steven , your neighbour . __eou__ I'm Charlie . Nice to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you , too . __eou__ Since we live in the same neighbourhood , maybe we can help each other from now on . __eou__ I guess so . I live next door but one , and hope you'll drop in now and then . __eou__ Thank you . I will . __eou__
The winter in Ottawa is freezing . __eou__ From mid-November , snow started to pile up in Ottawa . __eou__ I think I will be adapted to it . __eou__ Although the weather here is very cold , the people are warm . __eou__ Yes , that's the reason why I remain here . __eou__
The summers are so great here ! Not hot at all . I love the cooling breezes , the clear air , all the greenery . __eou__ This really has been a wonderful holiday for us . Shall we take a walk around the pond or into those woods for a while ? __eou__ Let's do both ! Are we in a rush or anything __eou__ No , not really . I had thought we'd stay in Hamburg tonight , but we can't unless we rush it . Let's stay in Bremen instead . Tomorrow we can have lunch in Hamburg , then check into a hostel in Copenhagen and have dinner there . __eou__ Sounds fine to me . Whatever , let's enjoy this pond first . __eou__ Sure . We can walk around to that path that leads into the woods there . Hey , look ! There are some wild ducks over there in the reeds . __eou__ I see them ! Wow ! How do you know they're wild ? __eou__ I used to go hunting with my uncle , that's how . __eou__ They're neat . Now Let's take that path into the woods and see what we can see ... __eou__
Wow . She can be really nasty , can't she ? __eou__ No . She was right . I was too nervous . I kept thinking , What if we blow it ? __eou__ Well , I guess Zina figured you couldn't blow it if you were in the hotel room . __eou__ She even stayed at a different hotel . She said I might be contagious . __eou__ Well , at least we have Stars.com . That'll be great publicity . __eou__
Hi , Bob , this is Mary . __eou__ Hello , Mary , where do you work ? __eou__ I work for an Internet company . __eou__ Is the pay good ? __eou__
Hey Jack . What's going on ? __eou__ Hey Matt . I'm going to ask Martha to marry me ? __eou__ Really ? When did you decide this ? __eou__ I always knew she was the one , but I decided to pop the big question about 2 weeks ago . I'm just debating on how to do it . __eou__ That's exciting , man . __eou__ So how did you propose ? __eou__ You shouldn't use my example . It wasn't special . I kind of wish I made it more special but it's too late now . __eou__ What do you think I should do ? __eou__ There are a lot of options . You can surprise her over dinner , or ask her in a public area , or if you have the balls , ask her father in front of her . __eou__ I never thought about that . __eou__ Thought about what ? __eou__ Asking her father in front of her . How do you think she will react ? __eou__ I don't know . You should know how she's going to react . She is your girlfriend . __eou__ I think that's the idea I was looking for . Thanks , man . __eou__ Don't mention it . Good luck . You're going to need it . __eou__
The bridegroom looks a bit nervous . __eou__ On this occasion , most people do . __eou__ Oh , they are playing the wedding March .

What's this , I wonder ? __eou__ I'm not sure.Let me have a look ... It could be a coffee grinder . __eou__ A coffee grinder ? __eou__ Yes , it must be used for grinding coffee beans . __eou__ Oh , that would be very useful . __eou__
Hi , Jack . Long time no see ! __eou__ Yeah . How's everything going ? __eou__ Not bad . At least I am still alive . __eou__ Just alive ? I guess you are some lucky guy . I heard you are going out with Jane . __eou__ Where did you get that idea ? __eou__ Oh , come on . Jane is a very nice girl , someone you meet only once till lifetime . __eou__ You are right . I am not boasting , but she is really as beautiful as she is intelligent . __eou__ Well , I really envy you for finding such a nice girl . __eou__
Here's your drink , sir . __eou__ No , that's not right . I didn't order a coffee . I ordered a cola . __eou__ Oh , I'm terribly sorry , sir . I'll go and get you cola right away . __eou__ Waiter ! __eou__ Yes , sir . I'll bring your drink right away . __eou__ It's not that . There's an animal in my soup . __eou__ Is there , sir ? I'm very sorry . I'll change it straight away . __eou__ I've never been to such a dirty restaurant , and never seen such slow service . __eou__ I'm really sorry . __eou__
Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ? __eou__ I suppose I do . __eou__ The climate here is pleasant . __eou__ You said it . __eou__ This city is really comfortable to living . __eou__ It sure is . __eou__ No other city can match it .

He's history ! __eou__ then who will you meet tonight ? __eou__ a guy I met on the internet three month ago . __eou__ really ? Are you sure this is a good idea ? __eou__ please don't be so fussy ! I didn't just meet him yesterday . __eou__ I know , but remember to meet in a public place and don't give out your personal information . __eou__

It seldom rains this summer . __eou__ Yeah , some places are very short of water . __eou__ Because of pollution and other things , our environment has become worse and worse . __eou__ You see , . This time I traveled to the West . When I looked out of the windows of the rain , all the lands that I could see are as dry as a bone . __eou__ It is serious . __eou__
These things are always oooo boring . Heard any gossip ? Anybody making the big bucks ? __eou__ Rich struck it rich in advertising . And he and Cath got married and just had a child . __eou__ That's no news . Those two were high school sweethearts anyway . __eou__ Teresa Jones got a boob job . __eou__ Uh , I can see that . And Erica Falls has lost a lot of weight . __eou__ I've got something . You saw Taylor Smith ? Looks terrible , doesn't he ? I heard he ... __eou__
How are your Chinese lessons going ? __eou__ Oh I ’ m learning very slowly . I think Chinese is more difficult than English . __eou__ Well I guess you have fewer characters but I think Chinese grammar is easier . __eou__ Maybe , but I think people usually learn English more quickly than Chinese . __eou__ Yes , I guess basic speaking in the English is easier . __eou__ Maybe that ’ s why your English is much better than my Chinese . __eou__

Let ’ s go to WAngFuJing by bus . __eou__ Better take the subway . It ’ s faster and more convenient . __eou__ Okay . It will be a new experience for me . __eou__ We have a rather comprehensive subway system here . we can get almost anywhere rather quickly on the subway . Especially at this time of a day when the traffic is heavy . __eou__ where do we pay the fare ? __eou__ Just give the man standing there three yuan and he'll give you a token . Then you slip it into slot at the turnstile and push the turnstile to get in . __eou__ Let me pay for it . __eou__ Where can I get the subway Madam ? __eou__ Ask the worker who sells token to give you one . It ’ s free of charge . Actually maps showing subway routes are posted at most stations . __eou__ Do I have to pay additional fare to change train ? __eou__ No , you don ’ t have to . Here comes the train . __eou__
I've heard The Hitchhiker would be on next week . I want to see it . __eou__ Is it horror movie ? __eou__ Yeah , I love horror movies the most . Would you like to go with me next weekend ? __eou__ No way . I will be scared out of my wits . __eou__ Well , What kind of movies do you like ? __eou__ Er , let me see . Romance , comedy , documentary , action , science fiction , cartoon and so on . __eou__ In a word , you like all the movies except for the horror movies . __eou__ Yeah , It seems like we don't talk the same language as far as movies are concerned . __eou__ Not quite . I also like romance and comedy movies very much . __eou__ The Terminal is a movie of this type . __eou__ So we can relax now . __eou__ Yeah , I could hardly wait to see it . __eou__
Excuse me , sir . Could you spare a minute ? __eou__ Uh , yes . __eou__ Do you go to work by train every day ? __eou__ Yes . I commute five days a week by train . __eou__ And would you mind telling us what you think of the rail service ? __eou__ It ’ s really very good . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ Well , trains are frequent and come on time . __eou__ Which train do you catch in the evening ? __eou__ I usually take the 5 thirty home . __eou__ And can you get a seat ? __eou__ No , I usually have to stand . __eou__ Would you agree that the service is fast ? __eou__ Yes , it ’ s reasonably fast but it certainly isn ’ t cheap . Fares have gone up25 % . __eou__
Hi , Kate . __eou__ Hi , Don . What a surprise ! __eou__ Yeah , I saw someone walking like you , but I wasn ’ t sure . We haven ’ t seen each other for how long ? Almost three months ? But you look quite different now . __eou__ Have you noticed what has changed ? __eou__ Oh , you look quite slender and more vivacious . What have you been taking ? Are you on a diet ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ m on a diet , but I ’ Ve not taken anything . I just eat less and exercise more . And it really worked in the past three months . I ’ Ve lost twelve pounds . __eou__ Wow ! That ’ s great . I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals , but it ’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . Also you know , old habits are hard to break . __eou__ What kind of exercise do you think I do ? I just go to dance everyday after work . I ’ m taking an amateur dance class . I dance two hours everyday . __eou__ Dance ? You only go dancing ? That ’ s not hard . I can do that . __eou__ Sure . Join my class next week . __eou__
How do you usually sell your products now ? __eou__ I'm doing business through Internet now . __eou__ Oh , really ? Is it a good way ? __eou__ Yes , very good . __eou__ What advantages does it have ? __eou__ It is very convenient . You know you can browse the website and send e-mails to your customers at any time . __eou__ Yes , if we do business through other ways , it will cost a lot of time . __eou__ Also it has low cost , and you know you only need to pay the fee of Internet , which is very cheap . __eou__ Yes , going abroad to join the exhibition will cost much . But does it have any disadvantages ? __eou__ To be frank , sometimes it is not so safe as doing business through traditional ways . __eou__ You mean there may be credit problems ? __eou__ Yes , but if you choose some good B2B websites , such problems can be avoided . __eou__ Will you give some suggestion ? __eou__ Of course , such as the Alabama , which is a famous website . __eou__ Thanks . Maybe I will do business through Internet in the future . __eou__
Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ? __eou__ Cinct de mayo ? __eou__ No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day . __eou__ Do we get a day off from school then ? __eou__ No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is . __eou__ Www , man ! __eou__ In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect . __eou__ Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ? __eou__ Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality . __eou__ And then what happened ? __eou__ Well , as we say , the rest is history ... __eou__
Did your wife give birth yet ? __eou__ Yeah . She's a healthy beautiful girl . __eou__ Congratulations . How is your wife doing ? __eou__ She is tired , but getting a lot of rest now . __eou__ That's good to hear . __eou__ I'm just glad there were no complications . __eou__ If your wife and baby are both happy , what more can you ask for ? __eou__ It's been a week , and I haven't slept that well . __eou__ That's normal for anyone with a newborn . __eou__ Yeah , but it's so hard . I have to work , and then go home and take care of my wife and the baby . I'm going to get sick at this rate . __eou__ You'll get used to it . After everything stabilizes , you can regain your health . __eou__ That's true . I should make sure my wife and baby stay healthy during this time . __eou__
Irene ! I heard you were on a date last night ! So , how how did it go ? I want all the juicy details ! __eou__ Um ... well , actually , we had a fantastic time last night . He was ... amazing ! __eou__ Okay , now you really have to fill me in . What ’ s he like ? __eou__ He ’ s really good looking . he ’ s quite tall , around 61 , he ’ s in his early thirties , and he ’ s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes ... __eou__ He sounds hot ! What does he do for a living ? __eou__ You know what , this is the best part . David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank , so he ’ s got a great career path ahead of him ! __eou__ Hold on a sec , his name is David ? __eou__ Yeah ? __eou__ That ’ s my brother ! __eou__
Hi , Lucy . What are you going to do this weekend ? __eou__ I have no idea yet . Do you have any suggestions ? __eou__ Would you like to play tennis with me ? __eou__ I'd like to . __eou__ Be sure to get to the sports hall at nine o'clock on Sunday morning . __eou__ OK , will do ! __eou__
I heard that Jim lost 100 yuan . Do you know that ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ But some classmates said you took the money . __eou__ It is not true . __eou__ Look at my eyes . __eou__ Well , I confess . I did it , because I urgently need money to buy some medicine for my mother for she is badly ill . I'm ashamed that I did that . __eou__ Return the money to Jim and make an apology . I think he will forgive you . __eou__ I will . __eou__
Howdy ! Nice car ! What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ I don ’ t know ! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . Luckily , I managed to start it up and drive it here . What do you think it is ? __eou__ Not sure yet.How about you pop the hood and we can take a look . Mmmm , it doesn ’ t look good . __eou__ What do you mean ? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . It ’ s brand new ! __eou__ Well missy , the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died . __eou__ Ugh ... So how long is this going to take ? An hour ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid a bit more than that . We need to order the spare parts , take apart your electrical system , fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks . __eou__ What ! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping ? This is not happening ! __eou__
I like this kind of weather . __eou__ Yes , a little breeze and a lovely moon . __eou__ And it's calm . I like the peace . __eou__ Me , too . __eou__
A friend of mine is now in the big house . He was caught red-handed for selling cocaine . __eou__ That is a deadly risky business . He should have it coming on him . __eou__ He must be regretting about having done the business . __eou__ I bet he is . He domed his own life . __eou__
Do you like climbing ? __eou__ Yes , I like it very much . __eou__ How about climbing up the Fragrant Mountain tomorrow ? __eou__ Where is it ? __eou__ It is located at the east foot of Western Mountain of Beijing , in a park with the same name . There are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer , so it is called ' Fragrant Mountain ' . __eou__ Have you visited it before ? __eou__ Many times . Except climbing , there are many attractions worth visiting . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ It is the best season to view red leaves from the Mid-October to the first ten days of November . During the period , thousands of hectares of maples on the sloping field are so red that you would recognize them as fallen petals by mistake if looking from a further area . The bright red , pink , scarlet , and peach-puff leaves are distributed in different layout , with some green pines and cypresses dotted in between . __eou__ Sounds marvelous . __eou__ You can take a bird-eye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain . __eou__ Great . I will prepare some clothes and food for the climbing . __eou__
What had make you so upset ? __eou__ Frank has gone out with Lucy again . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with that ? __eou__ Lucy is known as a social butterfly . She has taken many rich men for a ride , you know . __eou__
To be frank , I find philosophy rather boring . __eou__ To tell you the truth , it's the most tedious course I'ever had . __eou__ How could you manage to pass the exam ? __eou__ It is still a mystery to me . __eou__
That one looks pretty big . Are you going to keep it ? __eou__ Of course . I always keep what I catch . __eou__ Not me . I like to throw back what I catch . __eou__ If it's within the legal limit , I prefer to keep it . __eou__
Lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair . __eou__ Thanks , June . But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic before I ’ m allowed to repair cars for a living . __eou__ That ’ s not a big problem . There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified . __eou__ I guess I never thought of that before . __eou__ And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government . __eou__ Wow , you ’ Ve inspired me to do something ! __eou__
Hey , Ted . What are you up to this Friday ? __eou__ Well , I have the day off from work . __eou__ That ’ s great ! Do you have any plans ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve been working so hard lately , so I ’ ll probably just take it easy . __eou__ Sounds nice . __eou__ Yeah , I ’ ll probably just stay in and relax . Maybe watch a few movies . __eou__ Can I stop by ? __eou__ Sure . Any time . __eou__
Judy , what is everybody talking about ? __eou__ Haven ’ t you heard ? Richard was fired by our manager . __eou__ You ’ re kidding . It can ’ t be true . __eou__ Believe it or not . Everybody is talking about it in the company . __eou__ Really ? I ’ m surprised . __eou__ Me too . __eou__
How do you like waltz ? __eou__ It's very nice , I like it very much . __eou__ May I invite you for the first dance ? __eou__ My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer . __eou__ In fact , I took up dancing quite recently , too . __eou__ Oh , really ? But you're doing the tango wonderfully well . __eou__ I'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got a partner . __eou__ Thank you for your compliments . It's just that you are a good leader . Do you like the samba and waltz ? __eou__ Yes . And what dances do you like best ? __eou__ Waltz is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances . __eou__ Oh , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance . __eou__ My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . __eou__ Fine . __eou__
What can I do for you today ? __eou__ I need to return a book . __eou__ Can I do anything else for you ? __eou__ I want to check this magazine out . __eou__ We don ’ t allow people to check out magazines . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ It ’ s just a policy of ours . __eou__ So what am I allowed to check out ? __eou__ You may check out books or videos . __eou__ I need to check out this magazine . __eou__ You will have to just read it in the library . __eou__ That doesn ’ t make any sense . __eou__
Happy Valentine's Day ! __eou__ That's nice of you . __eou__ Could I treat you to dinner tonight ? __eou__ Wonderful . __eou__
Wow ! Look at the time . lt's about 11 0 ' clock . __eou__ Really ? I didn't realize it was so late . __eou__ I've got to catch the last bus . See you later . __eou__
Where are you going this weekend ? __eou__ I have no idea . Maybe I will sleep for the whole day . __eou__ So boring ! Shall we go out for a picnic with my friends ? __eou__ Sounds interesting . Who are the other people ? __eou__ Fred and David , my college class mates and Rachel . __eou__ Gorgeous ! What should I bring on that day ? __eou__ Your tent and enough food and water . __eou__ You mean , we can do many other things after the picnic , right ? __eou__ We can go fishing , chatting and camping . __eou__ What are we waiting for ? Come on ! __eou__ Don't hurry . Wait for my call . __eou__
so ... what kind of things do you do in your free time ? __eou__ I'm really into watching foreign films . what about you ? __eou__ I like to do just about anything outdoors . Do you enjoy camping ? __eou__ camping for an evening is ok , but I couldn't do it for much longer than one night ! __eou__ have you ever been camping in the Boundary Waters ? __eou__ no , but I've always wanted to do that . I've heard it's a beautiful place to go . __eou__ it's fantastic . My family and I are very fond of the place . __eou__ do you have any photos of any of your camping trips there ? __eou__ sure , would you like to see them ? __eou__ that'd be great . What kind of camera do you have ? __eou__ I have a Canon SLR . __eou__ so , you must be pretty interested in photography then . __eou__ I'd call it one of my hobbies . Do you know much about photography ? __eou__ actually , I do . I took quite a few photography classes at University . __eou__ have you heard about the photography exhibit that's going on at the art gallery this weekend ? __eou__ yes , I was planning on going . Are you ? __eou__ yes.In fact , maybe we could go together . __eou__ that'd be great . what time should I meet you there ? __eou__ how about at 11:00 ? __eou__ sounds great . see you then . __eou__
So Janet , do you do any sports ? __eou__ Well , I go to the gym a lot . I am a member of a gym nearby . __eou__ Yeah , how often do you go ? __eou__ About three times a week if I can . __eou__ Not bad ! Do you do any other sports ? __eou__ Not really . I ’ d really like to try golf , though . __eou__
Guess what ? I won the speech contest at my school . __eou__ Wow , that's great ! __eou__
Oh , hi Pam . When did you get back from Canada ? How was it ? __eou__ The day before yesterday . I only visited Montreal and Ottawa , but I had a great time . __eou__ Which city did you like better ? __eou__ That's hard to say ... I think Ottawa is prettier.It has better sightseeing , too . A lot of museums and galleries . __eou__ And what's Montreal like ? What did you think of it ? __eou__ Montreal is more exciting . It has better shopping.The stores are cheaper and more interesting . __eou__ Which one has better nightlife ? __eou__ Oh , Montreal of sure . It has more restaurants and clubs.They say Montreal is the most exciting city in Canada . __eou__ Well , I've always wanted to see Vancouver . I've heard it has the most beautiful views . __eou__
Well , you seem to enjoy speaking English . __eou__ You can't help learning when you're using it all day . You'll see . A few weeks ' study in the school will have a similar effect on you . __eou__ I hope so.You see , at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent . I'm awfully worried , I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect . __eou__ Oh , she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class . She doesn't mind your making mistakes , though . __eou__ You know , speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use . __eou__
What happened to my cup ? __eou__ I accidentally knocked it off the table and it broke . I'm really sorry . __eou__ Don't worry about it . I've got another one I can use . __eou__
Are you going out , Jack ? __eou__ I'll be right back . I just need to mail this package . __eou__
Which language do you speak ? __eou__ Well , I studied French at school , but I ’ Ve forgotten most of it . I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes . Do you speak Japanese at home with your pa __eou__ Yes , I do . I ’ m learning Chinese now on the internet . __eou__ How do you find studying a language on the internet ? __eou__ It ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good . __eou__ I bet you find the character difficult to write ! __eou__ Actually , many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese , so they ’ re easy for me . __eou__ So , you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers , right ? __eou__ Yes . How are the Spanish classes going ? __eou__ In a way , it ’ s similar to your experience of learning Chinese . Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones . But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself . __eou__
What happened to John ? __eou__ He quit __eou__
Professor , I will not be here for our next class meeting . __eou__ Is this absolutely necessary ? __eou__ I tried to work something out , but I really do have to miss one class . __eou__ Will you be able to make up the work you missed ? __eou__ I'm going to be doing a lot of extra reading . __eou__ Remember that I will only let you miss one class meeting per semester . __eou__ Yes , I remember . __eou__ Could you e-mail me this week as a reminder ? __eou__ Sure , no problem . __eou__ Make good use of that day off ; you'll only have one this semester ! __eou__
Ms.Green , are the schools more or less similar everywhere throughout the United States , or do they differ in various sections ? __eou__ The system of public schools is fairly uniform everywhere throughout the United States . __eou__ Do most students in the United States attend private schools or public schools ? __eou__ Most public schools in the United States are very good , and the majority of students attend the public schools . __eou__ Which students go to private schools , then ? __eou__ Children needing special instruction . Children whose parents can afford to send them to private schools , and children whose parents want them to receive a religious education . __eou__ But are the public schools good everywhere ? __eou__ No , public schools can be very different . Even in the same city . __eou__ Dose it cost anything to attend the public schools ? Are there any restrictions as to who may and may not attend ? __eou__ The public schools in the United States are free to everyone and there is no cost to the student . In most states , even the textbooks are free . There are no restrictions as to color , race , or religion.Any student wishing to attend the public schools may do so . __eou__
We thought you might like to participate in our rehearsal . __eou__ I ’ m afraid I ’ m already booked up for next Sunday . But thank you just the same . __eou__ That ’ s a pity . We can arrange another time hopefully . __eou__
Have you seen this ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ They killed another hostage . __eou__ Oh , how awful . What a terrible thing to do . __eou__ I agree completely . I just don't understand what's wrong with them . Don't they have any humanity ? __eou__ Well , maybe they've got a point . I mean , I suspect that they think the same about us . __eou__ Yes , but that doesn't make them right , does it ? Just because they think so ? __eou__ I guess not . My view is that we should give in to their demands , so that innocent people can stop getting killed . __eou__ Come on , you can't be serious ! We should never give in to terrorist's demands , otherwise where would we be ? __eou__ Well , that's probably true , but I don't think we should be dogmatic about it . A colleague of mine was kidnapped once , so perhaps I have a different view of things . __eou__ Really ? What happened ? __eou__ Well , it was in the Balkans during the war . He was only held for three days , and then they simply released him . It was a case of mistaken identity , and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . It was lucky they didn't kill him . __eou__ Oh , sure . __eou__
How have you been ? __eou__ Fine , thank you . __eou__ And how ’ s everyone in your family ? __eou__ Very well , thank you . I ’ m meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at 12 , would you care to join us ? __eou__ I ’ d love to but I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . I ’ Ve already got a lunch engagement . __eou__
Where did you get your mobile ? It's really cute . __eou__ Oh , this ? I got it in Singapore . Here , do you want to take a look ? __eou__ Thanks . Gee , it's really light ! __eou__ Yes , it is , isn't it ? A bit too light , really . What make have you got ? __eou__ I've got an old Ericsson . Here . Take a look . __eou__ Wow , that's really old . __eou__ Yes , I like collecting antiques . __eou__ Why don't you get a new one ? __eou__ I don't know . I like this one , and I don't have any need for all the bells and whistles you get on the new ones . __eou__ Really , what makes you say that ? __eou__ Well , I just need to make and receive calls , and it's quite reliable . I find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things , the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong , you know ? I mean , this camera function , for instance-how often do you use it ? __eou__ Sometimes , but I guess not very often . It's more for fun . Sometimes when I'm on a trip , for example , I can take a picture and send it to my kids . Or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately . __eou__ Well , that's nice I guess . So how many kids do you have ? __eou__ Three . Two boys and a girl . __eou__
I ’ m sorry , but I can ’ t find the book that you lend me . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s alright . __eou__ I must apologize . I ’ ll buy you a new one tomorrow . __eou__ No . Please don ’ t . I couldn ’ t let you do that . __eou__
How did Jim get the money ? __eou__ He borrowed it from Nick . __eou__ He must be mad ! Nick is a loan shark . __eou__ He was too desperate to find some other way . __eou__
Are your ready to go to the supermarket ? __eou__ Yes , are you ? __eou__ I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready . __eou__ You do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you . __eou__ It wasn't cold out this morning . __eou__ Well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there ! __eou__ Have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ? __eou__ It does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . __eou__ That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . __eou__ Ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here . __eou__ How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? __eou__ I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . __eou__ Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . __eou__ I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? __eou__ Good idea . That will help us to warm up . __eou__ If I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me . __eou__ Alright . I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you . __eou__
Is everything ready for the Christmas party ? __eou__ Almost . I ’ Ve put up the decorations , and we ’ Ve decorated the Christmas tree with plenty of tinsel and baubles . __eou__ I like the big star on the top of the tree . I ’ ll put the presents under the tree later , how ’ s the food . __eou__ I ’ Ve prepared most of it already and we ’ Ve got plenty of snack foods-you know , crisps , biscuits , and things . Are you going to make the punch ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ Ve bought all the things to go in it . It won ’ t take long to make . How many people are coming to the party ? __eou__ I think everyone will be coming . Dave don ’ t come because he has to go to his parent ’ s home and they live in Scotland . __eou__ Do we have Christmas pudding ? __eou__ Yes , we do . I hope we have enough for everyone . Did you send out all your Christmas cards in time ? __eou__ Yes , I did . I send most of them a week ago . I ’ Ve brought some with me to the party to give to people in person . __eou__ I did the same . I spent hours yesterday evening wrapping presents . I hope I didn ’ t forget to buy anyone something ! __eou__ I hope you didn ’ t forget mine ! __eou__
Today is the old couple ’ s golden wedding . __eou__ That must be a long love story . __eou__ Yeah . They promised to stick together forever when they were young . __eou__ They have made it . Will our love last 50 years ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . __eou__
Do you think you could keep the noise down ? __eou__ I'm sorry . Am I keeping you awake ? __eou__ Yes . And another thing , would you mind not making long distance calls ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I thought you wouldn't mind . __eou__
Hey , Brad . How was your day ? __eou__ Pretty good . Where are you going ? __eou__ I'm going home . __eou__ Wait . We have to return to our homeroom and wait to be dismissed . __eou__ Is that right ? __eou__ Our homeroom teacher has to take attendance again to make sure that we're all here . __eou__ So he takes attendance once in the morning and once in the afternoon . __eou__ Yeah . I'm going to my locker to get my jacket . Catch you later . __eou__
Mary and I decided to ring the curtain down on our love affair . __eou__ What ? You have been in love for six years , haven ’ t you ? __eou__ Don ’ t make a fuss . Many people divorce after having living together for many years . __eou__ What a pity . __eou__
Did you enjoy the movie ? __eou__ Oh , it's really a drag . __eou__ Sorry to hear that . I think it's even better than On the Golden pond . __eou__ Hell with it ! Nobody will give it an Academy award ! __eou__
I have some photos here taken by myself . Would you like to see them ? __eou__ Sure . Speaking of photos , what type of film will be the best ? You know , I'm planning a tour to Jiuzhaigou Valley . __eou__ I would get Fuji 200 film for taking photos of natural beauty . __eou__ Thank you so much . You're an expert . __eou__
How about you , Chuck ? Where did you grow up ? __eou__ Well , I was born in Ohio , but I grew up in Texas . __eou__ And when did you come to Los Angeles ? __eou__ In 1978 . I went to college here . __eou__ Oh . What was your major ? __eou__ Drama . I was an actor for five years after college . __eou__ That's interesting . So why did you become a hairdresser ? __eou__ Because I needed the money . And because I was good at it . Look ! What do you think ? __eou__

Can you believe the headlines ? __eou__ What are you reading ? __eou__ I'm reading about Michael Milliken , the Bond King . __eou__ Didn't he sell worthless stocks to people or something ? He got arrested for that , didn't he ? __eou__ He got arrested all right . __eou__ If I remember , he got off with a light sentence . Something like three years in a minimum-security prison . __eou__ Yup , that's him . He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless . __eou__ I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He's still a millionaire . __eou__ That's the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail . __eou__ I know . And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years . __eou__ Yup , you got it .

The idea about Friday the Thirteenth is totally ridiculous . I don't believe it at all . __eou__ Maybe you can't be so sure . __eou__ Why not ? The whole idea is superstitious . __eou__ But some people use this occasion to create trouble . Have you heard of the Black Friday Virus on the computer ? It is designed to break out on every Friday the Thirteenth . __eou__ I know that . But that has nothing to do with being unlucky . Those who created the virus are deliberately making fun of people . __eou__
I am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ? __eou__ Well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking .

I just don ’ t know what to do first . __eou__ Why not start with the most interesting one ? __eou__ Actually , I ’ m interested in all of them . The more choices we have , the harder to make a decision . __eou__ Toss a coin to decide then . __eou__

Some people pile on their agonise and try to seek other ’ s sympathy by telling them how miserable they are . __eou__ Yeah . They take the advantage of other people's hospitality and generosity . __eou__ I was fooled once . A lady told me she needed some money to keep the pot boiling . So I gave her some money and bailed her out of the situation . But later I learned that she had lied to me . __eou__ You are still wet behind the ears . You should have seen through her . __eou__ Nothing rang a bell . __eou__

Do you want to see them ? __eou__ sure . What's this one a picture of ? __eou__ oh , that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city . __eou__ you don't look very happy in that picture . __eou__ no , by that time , I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces ! __eou__ so what did you do ? __eou__ we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market .

It was very exciting . __eou__ Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ’ m sorry I missed it . __eou__ Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb . __eou__ Yeah , I will . See you then ! __eou__ O . K . See you . __eou__
Lucy , what are your priorities when buying a car ? __eou__ I guess the first thing is the price , the second is the size , and of course the color will play a role too . But I have to be honest . It is our today ’ s responsibility to take care about our environment . Therefore , I will also pay attention to the fuel consumption of the car . You know , the rise in gasoline prices is huge . So I would rather to consider a smaller car with smaller engine . For which I can also save some tax . Last of the list , I also consider the safety . __eou__ What about the environmental factors ? __eou__ Well , I do prefer the lower emission cars as long as it doesn ’ t cost much . Some environmentally-friendly cars are really expensive . __eou__ Sure they are . Some hi-tech devices are built in to make sure they pollute less . Some of these green cars have not become standard . So the production costs are still high . But anyway , we should make efforts to start with . __eou__
I don ’ t think I can take another semester of this dorm food . __eou__ I know what you mean , it leaves a lot to be desired . __eou__ Sure , like taste , variety , nutritional value , what I should do is move into an apartment off campus where I can cook for myself . __eou__ Have you found anything yet ? __eou__ You know how hard it is to find a decent place at this time of year ? __eou__ You should be able to find something comfortable in town , though that would be kind of far from school . __eou__ I got a car , so the distance wouldn ’ t really be a problem . __eou__ But the parking might be . __eou__ You bet ! __eou__
Richard , why didn't you come to school today ? __eou__ I'm sick . I think I've got the flu . __eou__ Well , take care of yourself . __eou__

William , do you like studying English ? __eou__ I like studying English , and I can read well , but speaking can be difficult . __eou__ It's not that bad .

I just want to know why Americans believe that sort of thing . __eou__ Believe what ? __eou__ You know ... like , say God is the creator of the universe , the Bible , and Jesus Christ ... __eou__ You don ’ t believe that ? Everyone interprets the Bible in a different way . To some people , the Gospel 5 is a source of much comfort . __eou__ What do you believe , John ? Are you Christian ? __eou__ To tell you the truth , I don ’ t know if I ’ m a Christian or not . Christians don ’ t often share the same belief . But I believe that we all possess , by the grace of God , the potential to create fantastic changes on this earth . __eou__ Do you believe that one religion is better than another ? __eou__ No , all religions are essentially based on the same ideals , so no one is really better . __eou__ Do you go to church regularly ? __eou__ When I ’ m home in the States , I go , but not in China . __eou__
I ’ Ve decided to go to the cinema alone this evening . __eou__ What has caused you to make such a decision ? Didn ’ t you used to go with Helen ? __eou__ Helen is nice but she talks a lot . __eou__ Oh . That ’ s really annoying when seeing a film . __eou__ It sure is . __eou__

Well , Mike , nowadays there's much talk about nanometer . But what on earth is it ? __eou__ Nanometer is a length scale . It's one billionth of a meter , roughly ten times the size of an individual atom . __eou__ Hmm ... it's hard to figure out the exact size , I'm afraid . __eou__ Well , let's make it this way . For comparison , 10 NM is 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair . There are as many nanometers in an inch as there are inches in 400 miles . __eou__ I see.Thank you . __eou__

Have you found a place yet ? __eou__ not yet . I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck . __eou__ well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ? __eou__ Mrs . Thou ? __eou__ yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look . __eou__ great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days ! __eou__ I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ? __eou__
Hey , How's it going ? __eou__ Not good . I lost my wallet . __eou__ Oh , that's too bad .

I'll wait for you . __eou__

Look , are you hungry ? Shall we go get something to eat ? __eou__ Sure . Why not ? __eou__ OK , well , let me just get my coat and we'll go to the diner around the corner . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Sometimes you look like brains , and sometimes you are simple a Barbie Doll . __eou__ I don ’ t know whether I am a Barbie Doll or you are one . __eou__ Maybe I am a Barbie Doll , but I won ’ t do Barbie Doll things . __eou__ Well , I am not going to flog a dead horse . Let get down to our brass tasks and tidy these things up . __eou__
I heard you were on a date last night ! So , how did it go ? I want all the juicy details ! __eou__ Um ... well , actually , we had a fantastic time last night .

Matthew , do you know much about body language in countries around the world ? __eou__ Sure , I've picked up a few things from travelling around for work . Why ? __eou__ Well , I had a meeting today with a woman from Japan and she wouldn't stop bowing ! I didn't know what to do ! __eou__ Did you bow back ? __eou__ No , I tried to shake her hand , but her hand was so limp I was a bit offended . __eou__ Well , Japanese businessmen and women typically bow to greet each other in Japan . She might have been offended by your strong handshake . __eou__ But she was in America ! Shouldn't she have known that strong handshakes in America signify confidence and respect ? __eou__ Things are different in Japan . You know , in some countries , making eye contact with others is considered rude . __eou__ Is that why she wouldn ’ t look at me in the meeting ? __eou__ I think it's highly possible , yes . __eou__ The meeting really didn ’ t go down well at all . I think I need to read up about intercultural communication before I have another meeting with someone from another country . __eou__ That's a good idea . When you don ’ t know much about other cultures , the simplest thing can offend someone . __eou__ That's so true . It's great that we see eye to eye on this . __eou__
It's raining . __eou__ Oh , no ! Not again . __eou__
How was your trip to Brazil ? Did you learn anything ? __eou__ I had no idea how seriously that country takes soccer ! __eou__ Tell me about it . __eou__ Okay .

Do you know what E-commerce is ? __eou__ Well , I'm not sure . Maybe it means we can buy something through the Internet . __eou__ That's right __eou__ It must be very convenient and pretty quick . __eou__ Sure , but you must have access to the Internet . __eou__
Michael Johnson doesn ’ t look graceful , but he sure is powerful . __eou__ If I were on as many steroids as he was , I think I ’ d be powerful , too . __eou__ What are you talking about ? ! He ’ s passed every drug test he ’ s taken ! __eou__ Those drug tests don ’ t mean anything ! He probably took some other drugs to mask the steroids . __eou__ Just because Ben Johnson was juiced up doesn ’ t mean all athletes are . __eou__ OK , OK . I ’ m feeling a little dehydrated . Let ’ s get something to drink . __eou__

Tom , did you see the film last night ? __eou__ Yes , I did , I thought it was a failure . __eou__ Do you really think so ? I don't think so . It wasn't that bad film at all . Didn't you hear the applause of the audience ? __eou__ Well , maybe so . But I still think everyone has their rights of their own opinion . __eou__ Well , i don't see the point of arguing this . __eou__
Do you surf online regularly , Joe ? __eou__ Of course . I stay online for four hours at least every day . __eou__ Are you crazy ? What are you doing four hours online ? __eou__ Millions of things .

Are there many idioms in English ? __eou__ There are hundreds and hundreds . English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions . __eou__ Can you give us an example ? __eou__ I'll look up the rate . To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof .

So Kim , have you ever had anything stolen ? __eou__ Stolen ? No , why ? __eou__ My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days . __eou__ Criminals are clever ? They're only successful when people are careless . __eou__ I don't know . The ones who stole my uncle's motorcycle were pretty good . __eou__ If your uncle had an alarm system , then it wouldn't have happened . __eou__ He did . It was one of the best ones available . But that didn't stop them from disabling 11 it . And on a crowded street too . __eou__ Didn't anyone stop them ? __eou__ You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that . No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen . The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away . __eou__ Wow , they were good . I guess criminals aren't that dumb after all . __eou__ That's not the end . They were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck . __eou__
He has a long head , I bet he will do well in his business . __eou__ He does , he started five years ago and now ends up the richest among us . __eou__ When we were students , he was no good in any subject . __eou__ It seemed to be useless to study well when we were young if we examine his case . __eou__

How is everything going with your girlfriend ? __eou__ Didn ’ t I tell you ? It ’ s over ! __eou__ Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did ’ t know that you had split up . What happened ? __eou__ It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up ! __eou__ Really ! Did she tell you why she didn ’ t show up ? __eou__ No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her with another man at a club near my home ! __eou__ What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ? __eou__ I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that night , but she didn't answer the phone . __eou__ I can ’ t believe she would do that to you . It ’ s so dishonest---and rude ! __eou__ I know . I still haven ’ t heard from her . The good thing is that I ’ m so angry with her that I don ’ t feel sad about not having her around . __eou__ I bet you she regrets what she ’ s done . You were such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn ’ t she ? __eou__ I guess so . It would be nice to know why she did this though . __eou__ I know . It ’ s always nice to have some closure , but I don ’ t think you ’ ll have a problem finding another girlfriend . __eou__

Maybe going around for a while . __eou__ Well , have you ever thought about learning some Chinese ? __eou__ Actually , I am learning that now . But it's too hard for me . You know the four tones and the stuff . It really freaks me out . __eou__ Don't worry . All things are difficult before they are easy . __eou__ You hit the nail right on the head . __eou__ Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ? __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ It's where I teach you Chinese , and in exchange you teach me English . __eou__ Awesome .

Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! __eou__ What is it ? What happened ? __eou__ I think someone is stalking me . __eou__ No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? __eou__ I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . __eou__ Did he leave when you left ? __eou__ Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ He followed me all the way home ! __eou__ That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . __eou__ Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? __eou__ Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . __eou__ Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! __eou__ Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . __eou__ I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . __eou__ Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry . __eou__ Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . __eou__

What's the matter ? __eou__ Well , I'm leaving Japan and I'm going back to London , tomorrow . __eou__ Really ! __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ How do you feel about that ? __eou__ Well , I do feel quite down because I am going to miss Japan after being here for 9 months , in Japan . I am going to miss it so much , cause I've had a great time here . __eou__ Mm , so what are you going to miss about Japan ? __eou__ Oh , I am going to miss the people , the food , the night life . Especially the nightlife . __eou__ What especially about the night life are you going to miss ? __eou__ Well , I really like dancing . And I enjoy going out to night clubs and to restaurants and eating Japanese food also and I'm really going to miss that because it's very different to London . __eou__ How are the clubs different in Japan than in London ? __eou__ Well , here there are many different clubs you can get into , for free , you don't have to pay , some of them . In London it's really expensive for drinks and an entry fee . __eou__
Ahh ... What a fine day ! I do feel like an outdoor exercise . __eou__ How about taking a walk in the park ? __eou__ OK . It's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh . __eou__ Oh , it's so quiet here . We have the park to ourselves , only you and me ! __eou__ Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your left . __eou__ Oh , I see them . Some are doing Taijiquan , some are performing swordplay , some are practising the Chinese Wushu . __eou__ A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China . __eou__

I have to prepare the supper for the whole family before I leave . __eou__ Oh , Ben has been cooking for us since I started attending this evening class .

S . now and I have to take care of everything myself . __eou__ How about your one-year-old baby ? __eou__ I've asked my parents to live with us for a while , so they can look after her for me while I am at work or in the class . __eou__ How sweet of them ! I have to work in the day time , study at night , and do housework during my spare time . I really hope I have eight arms and legs , like an octopus . __eou__ Me too . Sometimes I do want to give it up . I can't deal with so many things at a time . __eou__ When is your Adult College Entrance Exam ? __eou__ It's close coming up at the end of this month . That will be no more than 15 days from now on . __eou__ Oh , my Adult College Entrance Exam is also around then . I don't know if I can pass it . __eou__ Why don't you take the CPA exam ? You are already a good accountant , having so many years of experience . __eou__ I just want to study in a college , majoring in economics . I've had this dream for a long time . __eou__
Steve , when are you going back to America ? __eou__ Next week . __eou__ Wow , so soon ! I'm going to miss you . __eou__
what's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired . __eou__ My father failed in business . __eou__ Oh , that's really tough . __eou__ Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced . __eou__ I can understand . By the way , is there anyway I can help ? __eou__ No , not now . I have found a part-time job . So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties . __eou__ Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__

Well , what a nice day ! __eou__ Yeah , the air is really fresh . __eou__ But it was not at all so fine yesterday . __eou__ Because it rained last night . __eou__ Did it ? __eou__ It sure did . It was a heavy storm , with lots of thunder . __eou__ I was fast asleep , and didn't hear a thing . __eou__ Well , it may rain again later today . __eou__ Maybe . I see some dark clouds moving in . __eou__ There may also be a strong wind coming in . __eou__ It'll be dusty , too , I guess . __eou__ Maybe not . Dust is no longer a big problem in Beijing . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ We've been planting trees for many years . __eou__ I see . The fall in Beijing is really beautiful . __eou__ But the summer isn't . It's scorching in the summer . __eou__ Then what about spring ? __eou__ Spring is warm and short in Beijing . __eou__ It must be cold in the winter , though . __eou__ You got it . Oh , by the way , it may be really cool in the evening around this time of the year . Don't forget to put on more clothes , or you might catch a cold . __eou__ Thanks for reminding me . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
I hear you're being sent to Madrid for the annual conference . Is that right ? __eou__ Yes , it would be my first trip overseas .

But even if I don't get a chance to travel on my personal time , at least I can travel on company time ! __eou__ Well , being able to go to the conference sounds like such a great opportunity . Have you applied at the embassy for a visa yet ? __eou__ Yes , it wasn't too hard to get . All I had to do was fill out the paperwork and pay the application fee . __eou__ You leave next Tuesday , right ? What time is your flight ? __eou__ My flight departs at 7 am . I have everything except for my luggage ready . __eou__ If your flight is leaving so early , I can take you to the airport and see you off . I'll still be able to make it into the office by 9 . __eou__ That would be great ! Thanks a lot ! __eou__
I've been thinking of taking I've been thinking of taking a Crazy English course.Do you think it's a good idea __eou__ Sure ! You should do anything you can to improve your English . __eou__ Really ? Do you think English is that important ? __eou__ Of course it is.In fact , I'll even take the course with you if you want . __eou__ Great ! It's always better to do things with a friend . __eou__ Do you have the phone number ? I need to call for registration . __eou__ No , I left it at home.Sorry ! __eou__ That's OK . I can get it from you later . __eou__ So , do you want to go somewhere for dinner and practice our English together tonight ? __eou__ All right . I know a great restaurant near here.But , it's a little expensive and I don't have much money with me . __eou__ No problem . I just got paid.It ' s my treat . __eou__ Thank you ! I'll be sure to return the favor after our first class , OK ? __eou__ Forget it ! That's what friends are for ! Besides , I have a VIP card for a discount . __eou__ Good job ! This is going to be a great night ! __eou__ I think so too.Let ' s go ! __eou__
What are you and Corey doing for Valentine ’ s Day this Friday ? __eou__ Probably nothing . __eou__ You have to do something romantic . __eou__ Romantic ? I can't remember what that word means . __eou__ Well , you have three kids , so you knew what it meant once upon a time ! __eou__ Ha , ha ! Those days are long gone . __eou__
Do you take a bus to and from work ? __eou__ Yeah , everyday . And there ’ s only one choice.All the other buses are going the other direction . __eou__ Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ’ s always rush hour.So the buses are always crowded . __eou__ Oh , yeah , it ’ s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt . __eou__ That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus . __eou__ What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ? __eou__ You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding ! __eou__ Hmm . Good exercise , uh ? __eou__ Yeah , absolutely ! __eou__ And it ’ s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ’ s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her . __eou__ You were so happy , weren ’ t you ? __eou__ What do you think ? I ’ m a good boy . __eou__
I think it's high time we had lunch . __eou__ Of course . I can eat a horse now . __eou__ I am sorry for that . I was so attracted by the beautiful scenery . __eou__ Where shall we go now ? A Chinese restaurant or a local one ? __eou__ I suppose the local one . __eou__
Are you busy with your work ? __eou__ Yes . What about you ? __eou__ Yes , I'm very busy , too . Sometimes I work overtime . __eou__ Then your salary must be high . __eou__ Just so so . But we can travel twice every year . __eou__ Is this time one of them ? __eou__ Yes , we won't travel again until October . __eou__ Really ? We have only one chance every year . __eou__
What a beautiful sweater ! __eou__ Do you think it looks good on me ? __eou__ Yes , and it goes beautifully with your pants . __eou__ You won't believe it , but it was really cheap . __eou__ I wish I could find one just like it . __eou__
Let's go for a drink after work . __eou__ Nothing doing . __eou__
What kind of sport do you often do ? __eou__ I go jogging , how about you ? __eou__ I used to swim a lot , but now I'm taking gym classes . __eou__ Oh , that's fantastic ! __eou__
I can't believe the boss was absent from today's meeting . __eou__ Neither can I . __eou__
Any chance of using your telephone ? __eou__ You ’ Ve been using it for two weeks without paying . __eou__ Well , I thought it was not that serious . __eou__
Hey Jack . How's it going ? __eou__ I'm falling in love . __eou__ What ! With who ? __eou__ That girl in my econ class . She is so hot . __eou__ Did you guys go on a date already ? __eou__ No . I didn't even talk to her yet . But I think I'm in love . __eou__ Does she have a boyfriend ? __eou__ I don't think so . I've been following her around campus and I haven't seen another guy . __eou__ Dude , you're a stalker man . Just ask her on a date . __eou__ I plan on running into her in the cafeteria when she's alone . I think I'll ask her then . __eou__ So why do you think you're in love ? __eou__ She's the only thing I can think of all day long . __eou__ That's called blind love . Well , I gotta run . Tell me how it goes next week . __eou__ Aright . I'll talk to you later . __eou__
Your husband is very helpful , isn't he ? __eou__ Willing to help , maybe , but not as helpful as you think . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Last night he told the children a cliff-hanger story and both of them were scared out of sleep . __eou__

I bought it in Johnson thrift store . __eou__ Is it a used one ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ Oh , I don't think I will buy a used sofa even it looks so attractive . __eou__
I am tired of everything in my life . __eou__ What ? How happy you life is ! I do envy you . __eou__ You don ’ t know that I have been over-protected by my mother these years . I am really about to leave the family and spread my wings . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__

Ikebana , it's an art of flowers and it's quite different from Western style flower arrangement because in Ikebana's theory you can decorate one flower , only with one flower . __eou__ What's another Japanese art ? __eou__ Japanese art ? Mm , Ikebana ! Tea Ceremony ! __eou__ Tea Ceremony ! Tell me about Tea Ceremony . __eou__ Tea Ceremony ! It's , there's a certain way you have to make tea , not only make tea , there's a certain way to for example wipe a bowl . __eou__ I see . __eou__ Yes , with one piece of cloth , and you need to learn how to fold the cloth so that you you use each part of the cloth only once to wipe the bowl __eou__ How do you learn that ? Is that something that your mother would teach you ? How do people learn that ? __eou__ There's some professionals for both flower arrangement and tea ceremony . So you need to go to a school , yes , and learn from your teacher and their hierarchy and the organization and you need to pass each test to go , climb up the ladder in the hierarchy . __eou__
So , you finally got your doctorate in genetics . Well done ! __eou__ Thanks . Now , I have to find a job . __eou__ What are you thinking of doing ? __eou__ I ’ d like to conduct some scientific research into genes . It would be wonderful to make a medical breakthrough . __eou__ There must be several private companies that are interested in employing someone like you . You could do some research for a university . There ’ s a lot of discussion about genetics nowadays . Someone wit __eou__ Many companies and universities investing resources in genetics , because there are so many possibilities . Few people know where next discoveries will be made . __eou__ Well , I hope scientists don ’ t decode to make a clone of me in the future ! I wouldn ’ t like to be the subject of an experiment . __eou__
What newspaper are you reading ? __eou__ New York Times . I read it everyday . __eou__ Why don't you read the local newspaper ? __eou__ It's too biased . I just don't agree with their one-sided reporting . __eou__ New York Times is better ? __eou__ Yes , they have a good reputation for fairness . __eou__
Don't be too sad . If you really think that you have no feeling with him , then , in my opinion , getting divorced maybe is the best way to solve the problem . __eou__ I know clearly at the bottom of my heart . I just can't set my mind at rest because of the child . She's little . She cannot understand us and accept such truth . __eou__ Yeah , child is the matter . Don't tell Jenny the truth , only tell her the white lie . When she grows up , you find the suitable opportunity to tell her . __eou__ I see . OK . __eou__
Mark . Where have you been ? I ’ Ve been calling you all morning . __eou__ I ’ Ve been playing computer games . __eou__ What ? So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game ? What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore ? What are you playing ? __eou__ It ’ s called Counter Strike . It ’ s a first person shooter game . It ’ s awesome . It ’ s a multi player game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world . __eou__ You ’ Ve been wasting your time on this ? I can ’ t believe it ! It doesn ’ t even look fun or challenging ! __eou__ My laptop is on my bed . If you think it ’ s so easy then get on line and try to beat me . __eou__ Fine ! __eou__ Damp it ! How are you killing me with a single shot ? It ’ s not fair ! I don ’ t want to play anymore ! Let ’ s go get something to eat . __eou__ Can you bring me something ? I am totally hooked on this game ! __eou__
Hey , that ’ s a very nice hairdo you ’ re wearing ! __eou__ Oh you ’ re exaggerating . I ’ m never really good at making hairdo . __eou__ You did it yourself ? Wow , you are good ! __eou__ Thanks for saying so , but my husband thinks otherwise . __eou__ He ’ s just got no idea of how good you are . __eou__
Hey , Lily ! You won't believe what happened in class today ! __eou__ What ? __eou__ A man sent Miss Smith flowers , and Bryan got kicked out of class ! __eou__ Cool ! I wish I could have been there ! __eou__ Me , too . I miss you . Are you any better ? __eou__ Yes . But if I have any more soup , I think I'll die . __eou__
Does your wife work ? __eou__ Yes , she does . She works at home . __eou__ Oh , I understand . She cooks , cleans and takes care of children . Is that right ? __eou__ Oh , no . Most of the time I do these things . She is a writer . __eou__ You are really a hen-pecked husband . __eou__
What kinds of Tv programs do you enjoy watching ? __eou__ I like current affairs programs and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ? __eou__ I like those kinds of programs too . They ’ re very informative . I think that many people underrate the education value of Tv . __eou__ I agree . People often criticize Tv for showing too much sex and violence . __eou__ Yeah . And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational ! __eou__ Right . You can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs . __eou__ In my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . I think it ’ s about six minutes per hour . __eou__ That ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the Tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? __eou__ No . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on Tv in your country ? __eou__ Not as far as I know . We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! That ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable Tv , where you pay a fixed amount each month . __eou__ Some people have satellite and cable Tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their Tv programs . Besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programs . __eou__ Well , there ’ s a wildlife documentary on Tv in a few minutes . Shall we ? __eou__
Hi , Ann . I was wondering if you are free tomorrow night ? __eou__ Well , George . I guess I am . Why do you ask ? __eou__ I've just gotten a pair of pre-sale Star Wars movie tickets from a friend and was thinking of inviting you along for the opening premiere . Are you interested ? __eou__ Yeah , definitely ! Thanks for inviting me . __eou__ My pleasure . __eou__ I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day , but the pre-sale tickets were sold out . How did you manage to get hold of them ? __eou__ A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . He was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece . __eou__ You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? That's a huge premium over the regular price . __eou__ Not really . Considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market . Besides , I knew you were really looking forward to watching Star Wars on the opening day . __eou__ Wow ! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake .

How could he behave like that ? __eou__ it is true . Everyone kept looking at him . It was so embarrassing as I was sitting right next to him . __eou__ what a shame !

I'm a little nervous , but it's pretty exciting . __eou__ I bet . You must be stoked . __eou__ Yeah . I'm going to celebrate tonight . Wanna hang out ? __eou__ Sure .

Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I am a bit confused . My sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called Sociology and the Modern Age . According to the syllabus , the book is in the library , but I haven't been able to find it . __eou__ Do you have your syllabus with you ? May I see it ? __eou__ Yes , uh ... I put it in the front of my sociology notebook . Oh , here it is . __eou__ Let me see . Oh yes . Your professor has placed this book on reserve . That means you cannot find it on the shelves in its usual place . You need to go to a special room called the reserve room . It's down the hall and to the right . __eou__ I'm sorry - I still don't understand . __eou__ You see , your professor wants every one in the class to read the chapter . If one student removes the book from the library , it is likely that none of the other students will have the opportunity to read it . So , your professor has insured that all students have the opportunity to read it by placing it on reserve . __eou__ So , will I be able to find this book ? __eou__ Yes , when a book is on reserve , a student can go to the reserve room and ask the reserve librarian for the book . The student can have the book for a few hours , and he or she MUST read it in the library during that time . That way , the book stays in the library , and all students have a chance to read it . __eou__ Okay . Thank you . I understand now . __eou__ Will there be anything else ? __eou__ No ! I am on my way to the reserve room . Thanks again ! __eou__
The government has to face a lot of social problems now . __eou__ I think it is unemployment that gives rise to such social problems . __eou__ But it is very difficult for any government to handle it efficiently . __eou__ You are right . __eou__
How time flies ! __eou__ Bill and Betty have already grown up . __eou__ I can still remember our first date . __eou__ Look at that big tree over there . __eou__ Yeah , oh my god ! It ’ s still there . We have our first date right on there . __eou__ Do you know that I fell in love with you at the first sight then ? __eou__ You seemed to be dull at that time . __eou__ But you agreed to go out with me at last . __eou__ ( Smile ) I can ’ t believe this for it ’ s been 20 years since we got married . __eou__ So do you feel happy now ? __eou__ I couldn ’ t have been any happier ! __eou__ Of course , we are the happiest family in the world . __eou__

What can I do for you ? __eou__ I need a passport . __eou__ You can apply for one here . __eou__ When can I do that ? __eou__ If you like , you can apply right now . __eou__ That would be great . __eou__ I ’ m going to need you to complete this application . __eou__ What else do I have to do ? __eou__ Then I will take your picture for your passport . __eou__ How long will it take ? __eou__ Your passport will be ready in a few weeks . __eou__ Thank you . That ’ s perfect timing . __eou__
Her dress looks funny . __eou__ I wouldn't say that . It looks fine to me . __eou__ Are you kidding She is behind the times . That style went out last year . __eou__ Oh , come on , as long as it looks good on her . __eou__ Well , you ’ re really as out-dated as she is . __eou__ You ’ re darn right . I am out of style . So what What's the point of keeping yourself in style __eou__ No wonder you never buy me a new dress . __eou__
Hey , Sandy . Do you want to go to the ETV with us ? __eou__ I'd love to , but I'm broke . Maybe after payday . __eou__
What date is today ? __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Didn't you notice the roses everywhere ? __eou__ I hear it's Chinese Valentine's Day ! Don't you know ? __eou__ Oh , God . I just forgot it . I should have brought roses for my girlfriend . __eou__ It's not too late . Go to buy some now . __eou__
What's your favorite sport ? __eou__ It's hard to say . Perhaps swimming is my favorite . I like swimming because it helps improve my lung capacity . In the scorching summer days , there's nothing like a cool swim . Currently , I go to the pool twice every week . __eou__ Is the entrance charge expensive ? __eou__ Well , it costs an arm and a leg — 30 yuan per person . What a costly sport ! That is why I have to refrain from even thinking about it . And I find jogging a very agreeable substitute . __eou__ Haha , jogging ? Perhaps it might be a bit too boring ? __eou__ You know what ? You won't get a rush from it until you fully understand it . It is a simple sport and doesn't require skills of any sort . This leaves room for me to enjoy the beautiful suburban scenery while jogging . Fresh air caresses my face and blows into my chest , which translates into inspirations . Inspirations are really good stuff for a writer like me . Sometimes , I even come up with a verse or two . __eou__ You are really a man who knows how to enjoy being alone . __eou__
I'll need a parking permit for next semester . __eou__ Do you attend school during the day or only at night ? __eou__ I only attend class part-time in the evenings . __eou__ Do you drive a motorcycle or an automobile ? __eou__ I have both , but I usually use my car to get to school . __eou__ Great , the price for that permit is thirty dollars ; cash , check , or credit card ? __eou__ I'll pay cash . __eou__ Do you need to buy a duplicate permit for a second vehicle ? __eou__ No , thank you . __eou__ OK , here is your permit ; enjoy the next semester . __eou__

What a terrible house ! __eou__ I'm sick of it , too . __eou__ The door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart ! __eou__ It's no use complaining.If we had got enough money , we wouldn't put up with it ! __eou__
Oh , no . It looks like we're late . __eou__ Let's just sit in the back . We can still hear the service from here . __eou__ There're so many people here . Where are Rich and Cath and Taylor's parents ? __eou__ They're probably up front . The preacher's about to speak . Let's listen . __eou__ That was such a touching speech . He must have really known Taylor well . __eou__ Oh , how I wish this all wasn't happening ! __eou__
Mary , Pam and I are going to the mall later to buy some new clothes . Do you want to come ? __eou__ Can you say it again slowly ? __eou__ Pam and I are wondering if you'd like to go to the mall with us . __eou__ Oh , I see . I'll have to sink about it . __eou__ Sink ? __eou__ Oops . I meant , " think " __eou__ Mary , you're going to have to work on your pronunciation . __eou__ I know . __eou__ But give yourself some time . You just got here . __eou__
... The rings please . May this ring be blessed so he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace , and continue in love until life ’ s end . __eou__ With this ring I thee wed . Wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment . __eou__ Honey , that ’ s my pinkie . The ring goes on the ring finger ! __eou__ This one ? __eou__ That ’ s my index finger ! __eou__ Oh , right . This one , right ? __eou__ Umm ... that ’ s the thumb , Nick . __eou__ Okay , Okay , I got it ! This is the ring finger ! __eou__ That ’ s my middle finger , Nick . This is my ring finger ! __eou__
Have you heard about Michael's new home ? It's in one of the poshest areas in this area . __eou__ Is he living in the new housing estate in Killington ? __eou__ No , he's living in an old house in Warton . __eou__ Do you mean the one near the health centre on Old Slate Road ? __eou__ That's the one . __eou__ His house must be worth millions ! That is one of the most beautiful areas in Oxford . The surrounding area is really peaceful , and getting into the city centre from there is very convenient . How can he afford that place ? __eou__ He didn't buy it . His grandfather died recently and left him loads of money . __eou__ Did he know that his grandfather was so wealthy ? __eou__ No one in the family expected to get a dime from him . It was quite a surprise . __eou__ What a lucky man . __eou__ He still has a complaint though . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ He wanted to live right on a bus line , but he doesn't . so , if he wants to take a bus anywhere , he has to walk 1/4 mile to get to a bus stop . __eou__ The poor thing . It must be difficult being him . __eou__ You can say that again . __eou__
It's said that the government will clamp down on the new policy . __eou__ Are you sure of that ? __eou__ I am not certain about that . __eou__ They may have some difficulty in doing it . __eou__
I couldn ’ t believe you should crack such a joke to them . __eou__ What was wrong ? __eou__ You carried it too far . You obviously offended someone . __eou__ I didn ’ t mean to hurt anyone . __eou__ I know , I know . But someone took offence . __eou__
hello . Where are you headed today ? __eou__ I'm off to Barcelona for a week . __eou__ do you have your passport with you ? __eou__ yes , here you go . I don't need a visa to go to Spain , do I ? __eou__ fortunately for you , you don't . Next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport . __eou__ that's good advice . __eou__ would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ? __eou__ are there any seats available by the emergency exits ? __eou__ let me see here ... yes , there's one left . __eou__ ok . I'll take that one then . __eou__ alright .

I think it's important that all people have the ability to read . __eou__ I agree with you , but that's easier said than done . __eou__
Hey , Cindy , I ’ m so sorry about yesterday . I shouldn ’ t have yelled at you in front of everyone . __eou__ Don ’ t worry about it . __eou__ I don ’ t know what happened to me . I just lost it . __eou__ I think you just need to get more sleep . __eou__ Yes , you ’ re right . Good night . __eou__
We can't wait any longer ... __eou__ I'm terribly sorry to be so late . I had an article ... __eou__ You'll knock yourself out the way you've worked.Why don't you slow down ? __eou__ I can't afford to . __eou__ All right.Now that everybody's here . Shall we be getting started ? Miss Lin , are you ready ? __eou__ Yes , thanks.Before I start , I'd like to thank Professor Smith for all his help in giving me unlimited access to his research materials . __eou__ Excuse me , Miss Lin.Would you mind speaking up , please ?

Mark , you've been coming home late these days . What are you busy doing ? __eou__ Nothing important . I've been working overtime lately . __eou__ How many hours do you work each day now ? __eou__ 12 hours , including 5 hours overtime . __eou__ That's tough indeed ! Do you think your health can afford ? __eou__ I don't care . I need money . __eou__ Surely you'll be paid extra for overtime , but do you think it's really worth ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . When I work overtime I'm paid time and a half . __eou__ Oh , yes . Money comes faster in that way than otherwise . __eou__ But jobs with a lot of overtime are quite limited . Employers usually don't like to pay for overtime if they can manage . __eou__ That's true . __eou__
Which sports are popular in your country ? __eou__ Most people like football . More boys like football than girls . A few girls play it really well .

Many people like swimming , because it is fun and keeps you fit . __eou__ In my country , many people enjoy golf , but it is too expensive for some people . A few people like extreme sports , but I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them . __eou__ Extreme sports are only for a small minority of people . Several people from my university enjoy them , but most of us just watch . No one I know plays golf . __eou__ I know loads of people who play it regularly . There are plenty of golf courses around the country . In the past , only a tiny number of people played . __eou__ A great deal of people follow rugby in my country . __eou__ There are plenty of rugby fans in my country too . __eou__
Trina , will you marry me ? __eou__ Yes ! Yes ! And yes ! Jared , of course I ’ ll marry you ! __eou__ Oh , Babe , I can ’ t wait to spend the rest of my life with you ! I can ’ t wait for all the adventures we ’ re going to have , for all the fights and the laughter . I can ’ t wait to grow old and wrinkly with you . __eou__ Oh , Jared ! I can ’ t wait for our wedding ! I hope you don ’ t mind , but I ’ Ve already chosen a date ! Six months from now in the summer ! Melissa saw you buying the ring last month so I ’ Ve had plenty of time to start planning ! __eou__ She what ? __eou__ Oh don ’ t worry , sweetie , I didn ’ t know when you were going to propose . It was still a nice surprise ! As I was saying , I ’ Ve got it all planned out . There ’ s almost nothing left to do ! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending . __eou__ Four hundred ? __eou__ No need to sweat it . My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding , which is going to be low-budget anyway . So roughly four hundred people , which means that the hall at Northwoods Heights will be our reception venue . I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents ’ church and my uncle of course would be officiating . We ’ ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling . The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer . My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that . My cousin will be the official photographer . I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . Did you know that she ’ s going to be a professional opera singer ? __eou__ Ah ... __eou__ And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we ’ ll get the Youth Group to serve us . I was thinking that your friend ’ s band could be our entertainment for the night . though they might have to tone it down a bit . Or we could hire a DJ . Your sister ’ s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ’ s their name again ? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine . And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ’ ll make our toasts ! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? Who else am I missing ? Oh , your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake ! __eou__ Wow . __eou__ See ? It ’ s going to be wonderful ! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of . __eou__ If I survive the next six months . __eou__
No . 164 in lane 3 achieved 11 ' 16 in the 100 meter dash . Isn't that something ? __eou__ Yeah . He's the most experienced athlete in the field . __eou__ He won the first place ! __eou__ Good boy ! __eou__
When is your vacation going to start ? __eou__ I'll be leaving on the fifth of August for the vacation __eou__ Oh , that's only a few days from now ! How many weeks are you going to be taking ? __eou__ I'm taking two weeks now . but I want to save the other week and take it sometime during the winter . __eou__ Where are you going now . __eou__ To the beach __eou__ Have you made your hotel reservation yet ? __eou__ Oh , I don't need to do that . I'll be staying with friends __eou__ You're lucky . It's hard to find a place to stay at the beach in August __eou__ Just think , in a few days , I'll be swimming and lying in the sun and just taking it easy . __eou__
What a hot day ! __eou__ Yes , summer is coming . __eou__ Where are you going this summer vacation ? __eou__ I'd like to go to Tianjin . __eou__ Do you want to go to the beach there ? __eou__ Yes , of course . And what's your plan ? __eou__ The same to you . __eou__ That's great . __eou__
I don't think I'm getting better . __eou__ Believe me , you really look much better than before . __eou__ I'm still not sure whether I can recover from it . __eou__
Hey John . I have some great news . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I got a job offer from Dell . __eou__ That's great . I thought you said you didn't get the job . __eou__ I thought I did bad on the interview , but I guess I was wrong . I'm so happy right now . __eou__ I bet . That's great news . I'm very happy for you . __eou__ Thanks . I feel like celebrating . Let's go have a beer . It's on me . __eou__ Sounds good . __eou__
What would you like to drink ? Tea or coffee ? __eou__ Coffee , please . __eou__ So , you also like Coffee ? __eou__ Yes , of course . I can't go through a day without coffee in the morning . __eou__ Me too , but I think we shouldn't drink too much of it , as it's not very healthy . __eou__ I totally disagree . The other day I read in a book that a number of recent studies suggest that it can be a highly beneficial drink . Researchers have found strong evidence that coffee reduces the risk of several serious aimed 3 ' including diabetes , heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver . __eou__ But I also heard that coffee and its caffeine content , serve as a drug on the human body that negatively affects the central nervous system , as well as other organs , and leads to addiction __eou__ I don't think so . Coffee helps me wake up , keep alert , and improve my short term memory . __eou__ Well , I adjust going to have to disagree with you . A healthy body wakes up without caffeine ! __eou__ Maybe you are right to some extent . __eou__ You may try to have some alternatives and see how you feel . __eou__ Maybe I could have a try . __eou__
May I have two tickets for Tiny Times ? __eou__ OK . What time ? __eou__ 2:30 , please . __eou__ It's 60 yuan , please . __eou__ Sorry , we have student cards . We can get discounts with these , can't we ? __eou__ Sure . That'll be 40 yuan , please . __eou__ Here is 50 yuan . __eou__

I can't stand computer geeks . __eou__ Sorry , Dave , I didn't mean you . I am just not in the mood for this . I have work to do . __eou__ Who do you think it is ? __eou__
Do you have brothers and sisters ? __eou__ No , I am the only child in my family . __eou__ Oh , I have an elder sister . She is married .. Her husband is a businessman . __eou__ Do they live with you and your parents ? __eou__ No , they live alone . __eou__
I don't know how to deal with Jack . He is indeed a trouble maker . He has loused up my business several times . __eou__ You mean Lily's boyfriend ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Well , he is a hard case . Everyone would feel headache about him . __eou__
Mike , what are you doing tonight ? __eou__ Nothing special . I just want to get plastered . __eou__ I don't feel like drinking tonight . I'm gonna hang out at YY's . __eou__ YY's ? That place is boring . How about Xara's ? It's real classy , and they keep the place spin and span . __eou__ Yeah , but it's expensive . Nah , I'm going to YY's . __eou__ On second thought , I think I'll join you . __eou__ They ' Ve just renovated the place . You may be surprised . __eou__ Wow , they really went to town on this place ! __eou__ Quite a difference , huh ? __eou__ Sure is . Waiter , bring us two drafts , please . __eou__ Ah hah.Thought you were't drinking . __eou__ When in Rome , do as the Romans do . __eou__
Hey , Rose , how are you feeling ? __eou__ Much better today . __eou__ Oh , Look at the baby.It ' s so beautiful.Is it a boy or a girl ? __eou__ It's a girl . __eou__ Can I hold it for a moment ? __eou__ Sure.She is a peaceful child . __eou__ Oh , how adorable ! She's got your eyes . __eou__ So they say . __eou__ When are you returning home ? __eou__ Well.The doctor said I have to remain here for at least two more days because I'm rather weak after childbirth . __eou__ You can use some time off.You ' Ve been working too hard anyway . __eou__
Mom , have we got any cookies ? __eou__ Cookies ? You just ate an hour ago . __eou__ I know , but I'm hungry . __eou__ Well , why don't you have some fruit instead ? __eou__ Aw , Mom . I don't want fruit , Aren't there any chocolate chips ? __eou__
Are you cold ? __eou__ Yes , a little . __eou__ I wonder if we can change the temperature . __eou__ I tried before . There are no buttons on the air conditioning . __eou__ There must be buttons . How do they turn it on and off ? __eou__ I think it is centrally controlled . They control it at the main desk . __eou__ Well , they have it too cold in here . I want to be warmer . I won't be able to sleep . __eou__ I'm going downstairs for more drinking water . I will ask them . __eou__ What did they say about the air conditioning ? __eou__ They said it is centrally controlled.All the rooms are the same . They can't change it . __eou__ That's stupid . How can I sleep in this ? __eou__ You can wear more clothes . __eou__
hello ! How are you today ? __eou__ hi . I ’ m feeling very nervous . I just had a test and I ’ m not sure how well or how badly I did . __eou__ it ’ s not use worrying about it now . you ’ Ve done test and you can ’ t change any of your answers . __eou__ that ’ s true . I really should go home and prepare for the next test , but I ’ m feeling tired . __eou__ let ’ s go and get a coffee together . That will help you to wake up again ! __eou__ ok . I feel like sitting down and having a chat . How have you been recently ? __eou__ oh , you know me . I ’ m always happy ! If I think I ’ m getting into a bad mood , I call some friends and socialize or have a chat . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . I usually just sit at home alone and get increasingly moody . __eou__ I hate spending too much time at home . I get bored of it really quickly . I ’ m always excited about going out to party or other social event and meeting people . __eou__ perhaps I ’ m being too shy . I should go out more too and not spend time worrying about tests ! __eou__
Hey , Lily , what are you doing ? __eou__ Waiting for someone . __eou__ You mean the boy you met on MSN ? __eou__ You're right . He is so funny and I think I'm in love with him . __eou__ You must be joking . You can't fall in love with someone you've never met ! __eou__ I know , but I keep thinking of him every day . And I get really depressed when he's not online . __eou__ I think it's just a crush . You can't be serious . __eou__ Well , this might be silly . But I just can't get him off my mind . And I can't help missing him . __eou__ Did you tell him ? __eou__ Yes . He said I'm his dream girl . __eou__ You shouldn't take it too seriously . It might be a lie . __eou__ I know . I can't tell whether he's serious or not so I need your advice . __eou__ I think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends , and then the right person will come along . __eou__
The new computer software is driving me crazy ! I really need a break ! __eou__ I know what you mean , Carol . I ’ Ve had nothing but trouble with it . They say it ’ s supposed to be easy ! __eou__ That ’ s what I ’ Ve heard . But as far as I ’ m concerned , it takes a genius to figure it out . Can you pass the sugar , please ? __eou__ Sure . Why don ’ t you sit down for a minute ? You haven ’ t taken a rest all morning . __eou__
So , Is this your first time to TAIWAN ? __eou__ No , I first came here 1995 . __eou__ Oh , really ? And you are from the State , right ? __eou__ Well , I am from Canada . Actually . __eou__ Oh , I am so sorry . __eou__ That ' ok . That's happens all the time . __eou__
Susan is going to get a divorce . __eou__ How do you know that ? __eou__ She told me that peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage . __eou__ Oh , I see . But I think you are making a fuss . They will make it up . Bet it . __eou__
Tomorrow will be my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ? __eou__ Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ’ s dress code . __eou__ Indeed , I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview . Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . It seems that their dress code is not that formal . Probably , I should put on car key and simple shirt . __eou__ Whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean . __eou__
Ye Ting , who are these people in the picture ? __eou__ They're my family __eou__ So you have two brothers ? __eou__ Yes , I'm the third child . __eou__

The film will be over at nine . Can I have the key to the bicycle ? __eou__ No . I won't let you ride a bicycle late at night . __eou__ Oh , dad , I'm not a child . I'm 17 already . I'll come back as soon as the film is over . __eou__ OK . Here's the key . Take care . __eou__ I will . Thank you , dad . __eou__

Uh , Justin , would you like to see Otis Lesley on Thursday night ? He's at the Kangaroo Club . __eou__ I'm sorry , Karen , but I can't . I have to work late this Thursday . __eou__ Oh ... that's too bad . __eou__ Yeah . I really like Lesley . __eou__ Actually , are you doing anything on Friday or Saturday ? He's playing those two nights as well . __eou__ Well , I can't make it on Friday either , but I'm free on Saturday night .

The category is Best Pictures . __eou__ OK , here's your question What movie won the 1996 Oscar for Best Picture ? __eou__ I know that , it's The English Patient . It was one of the only good American movies of the 90s . __eou__ Well , along with Jurassic Park ! Nice going , you got the right answer . __eou__

So Jen , what did you think of William ? Did you guys have a nice time on your first date ? __eou__ Oh yeah , it was great ! He took me to an Italian restaurant and we had an amazing conversation . I told him about how many kids I want , and how my parents will be so excited to meet him . __eou__ You said all that on the first date ? Alright ... Well are you two going out again ? __eou__ Yeah ! I called him after I got home to arrange our next date , but unfortunately his grandma is sick so he has been busy every night visiting her in the hospital . __eou__
I think Andy's party will be fun . __eou__ Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ? __eou__ Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ? __eou__ My boots ? Er ... Sure , ok . __eou__

You'll see that they are really catchy . __eou__
Do you believe in god ? __eou__ Not at all . I ’ m an agnostic . Do you ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure . Why don ’ t you believe there is a god ? __eou__ I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one . __eou__ I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet . __eou__ I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics . __eou__ Yes . Such people don ’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs . __eou__
Cindy , I have this room to myself ? __eou__ It's all yours . __eou__ It's twice as big as my room in Taiwan ! __eou__ Well , I hope it's comfortable enough for you . __eou__ I think I'm going to like it here . __eou__ You have a phone on the bedside table that you can use . __eou__ Wow , I have my own bathroom ! __eou__ Kind of . It leads to my bedroom . __eou__ We share the same bathroom , in other words . __eou__
Joe , how are you doing ? __eou__ Pretty good . Mary , I was wondering if you would like to come to a party on Friday night ? __eou__ I am free that night , and a party sounds good . __eou__ Fine . It will be at my house . Do you know how to get there ? __eou__ I kind of know where you live , but could you e-mail me your address ? __eou__ I can do that .

And we don't even have a working demo yet . __eou__ I can't take the credit for that . I'm just Zina's assistant . She's the pro . __eou__
I wish you would not be so selfish . __eou__ Selfishness is one human beings instincts . It is very difficult to get it out root and branch . __eou__ But you should at least consider your son's future . __eou__ His mother , not me , should do this . __eou__
We ’ re going to the movies . Will you join us ? __eou__ I ’ m very sorry I can ’ t . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid I have some business to attend to . __eou__ Then would you like to have lunch with us ? __eou__ I ’ d love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now . __eou__ Would you like me to give you a lift ? __eou__ No , thanks .

There are security guards on duty 24 hours a day and they patrol all over the neighborhood . You know , they are all very strong . __eou__ Really ? That's good . Is there any supermarket in our neighborhood ? __eou__ Of course . There is a Carrefour near the neighborhood . I'll show you there if you want to . __eou__ That's terrific ! __eou__ By the way , a party will be held for new neighbors the day after tomorrow . I hope I can see you there . __eou__ Yeah , and we can get to know each other at the party . __eou__
Dave , wake up . __eou__ Which ? Zina ? What time is it ? __eou__ It's seven-thirty . I want to know who left this note on my desk . __eou__ What note ? I can't see . I just pulled an all-nighter . __eou__ It's a little green post-it note , stuck right in the middle of my computer screen . __eou__ And ? What does it say ? Isn't there a name ? __eou__ It says , Zina , I like how you rhumba . An admirer . __eou__
I know I ’ m going to bite the dust going down this hill . I almost got killed on the chair lift ! This is going to be so embarrassing . __eou__ Don ’ t worry .

Will you come shopping with me ? __eou__ Sure I like shopping . Who is organizing the party ? __eou__ One of the girls in my office . __eou__ What's the occasion ? __eou__ There is no specie occasion . She just likes to organize parties from time to time . This time it is a country theme . __eou__ That's easy , how about a cowgirl ? Oh I know even better , a Canadian Mountie . __eou__ Well where am I going to get that sort of costume ? __eou__ Leave it to me . I know exactly where to find it . __eou__ Oh good . __eou__ Excellent , come over at ten o'clock and we will start at the shopping center , the one around the corner from my house . They have just the shop we need . __eou__
What do you think of when you're praying ? __eou__ I try to picture the Lord's face in my mind . __eou__ Does that help you faith ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__
Tom ! How are you ? We missed you at the party last night . Are you OK ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . I didn ’ t really feel like going out . I guess I ’ m feeling a little homesick . __eou__ Come on.We ’ Ve been through this already ! Look , I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it . __eou__ I was . It ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ’ t be able to home because I can ’ t afford the airfare . I ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family . __eou__ Yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . When I first got here , I ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . I almost let it get to me , but then I started going out , keeping myself busy and before I knew it , I was used to to it . __eou__ I see what you mean , but I ’ m still bummed out . __eou__ OK . how does this sound . let ’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight .

It says here that you are a business major and you are in your second year . Is this information correct ? __eou__ Yes . I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology . __eou__ Sure . That ’ s not a problem . Do you have the list of courses you want to take this semester ? __eou__ Yeah . Here ’ s my list . I ’ m not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though . __eou__ Yeah , that ’ s perfect . What about the subjects for your minor ? __eou__ Oh yeah ! Almost forgot !

You are registered now , you ’ ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start . __eou__
I used to be down on the sales people until I saw her in action . __eou__ She means business , for sure . __eou__ Most salespeople seem like half-brains . Zina's definitely an exception . __eou__ We'd better get back to work . __eou__ Yeah , I'm not too worried about Vince , but I'd hate to face Zina if we don't deliver ... __eou__
It seems like it rains every time we plan a picnic . __eou__ Well , that's life . __eou__
You are late . What ’ s the deal ? __eou__ Sorry , I was delayed by something and stuck in traffic . __eou__

I hope it's nothing serious . __eou__ Last week his sister was admitted to the hospital . __eou__ Oh ? What happened ? __eou__ His sister had a car accident last week . __eou__ Is she fine now ? __eou__ She is still in a coma . __eou__ Oh , poor Alan ! His sister is the only one he has left since his parents died last year . __eou__
This cake is excellent . Where did you buy it ? __eou__ Actually , my mother made it from scratch . __eou__
Excuse me . Mr . Li . May I ask you some questions ? __eou__ Sure . Take a seat , please . What would you like to know ? __eou__ Can you tell me how many credits would be enough for a Bachelor's degree ? __eou__ A Bachelor is awarded to a student who successfully completes over 120 units , including general and specific requirements , for his or her undergraduate major and elective courses . __eou__ How long does it take to earn a Bachelor's degree ? __eou__ Normally it can be completed in four years . __eou__
I would much rather see her once or twice and not do anything about it — — what could I about it anyway ? __eou__ Don ’ t say things like this . Please be confident . I think you still have the chance to win her love , unless you don ’ t love her anymore . __eou__ Don ’ t you think she is a bit out of my way ? __eou__ In some way , she is more modern . __eou__ If I do try to do anything , I ’ d only be sent off with a flea in my ear . __eou__ If you really think so , in my opinion you should give up this feeling completely . __eou__
Excuse me . Have you got the time ? __eou__ My watch says half past five . __eou__ Does your watch keep good time ? __eou__ Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__

They can teach elephants to dance nowadays perhaps there's hope for us ! __eou__
Come in and have some coffee , Anna . The kids have just gone out to the mall to hang out with their friends . __eou__ I saw a lot of teenagers when Alan and I were there yesterday . __eou__ They spend hours there , especially on weekends . __eou__ Speaking of that trip , Alan bought a shirt at a department store , but the sleeves are too long . Do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ? __eou__ I know several . But wouldn ’ t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ? __eou__ Isn ’ t that complicated ? __eou__ No , it ’ s easy . We ’ ll just take the shirt back to the men ’ s department and show them the sales slip . They ’ ll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund . __eou__ We ? Do you want to go with me ? __eou__ Sure . I love going to the mall . __eou__ What do you do there ... hang around , like the kids ? __eou__

I just can ’ t ! I ’ m not ready for marriage ! What was I thinking ? I ’ m only thirty five years old ! I ’ Ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! I can ’ t settle down yet ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? It wasn ’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family ! __eou__ I know . I know ! __eou__ Let ’ s think this through . First of all , you cannot leave Amy at the altar . Not only will she be humiliated and kill you , but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? Second of all , you are just getting cold feet . You know deep down inside that you want to marry her , so cut the crap and do it ! __eou__ You ’ re right . I ’ m being crazy ! Ok , I ’ m ready , let ’ s do this ! __eou__ Great ! Phew ! That was a close one ! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was gonna have to slap some sense into you . __eou__
Yesterday was April the first . __eou__ Was it quite special ? __eou__ Not for the others , but for me . I was in the library going over my lessons when suddenly one of my roommates came in . He told me that I was wanted on the phone in my dormitory , and that person would call me again several minutes later . __eou__ Did you hurry back to the bedroom ? __eou__ Yes . I went back to the dorm only to find my roommates laughing and shouting " April Fool , April Fool " . __eou__ Oh , your classmates took you in . __eou__ Only then did I realize it was April Fools ' Day . __eou__
You look great today . And so beautiful . I love your elegant haircut . __eou__ Thanks . Wendy . There will be an important dinner party tonight . So I must make me the focus of my friends . __eou__
Hey Jack . Are you excited about starting work ? __eou__ Yeah . I'm really looking forward to it . __eou__ What was more exciting , starting college or starting work ? __eou__ They're pretty similar , but in different ways . I really can't decide . How about you ? __eou__ For me , I think starting school was more exciting . __eou__ Does that mean work isn't that great ? __eou__ It's different for everyone , but because I knew school was going to be so much fun , I really got excited about it . __eou__ But work is a huge portion of our lives . I'm looking forward to making it fun . __eou__ That's a great attitude to have . I don't think you'll have any problems in the workforce . __eou__ I hope you're right . __eou__
So did you get in touch with your brother ? __eou__ No , not yet . I'm really worried . __eou__ Well , it'd be foolish to call the police . He probably just went away overnight . __eou__ Maybe you're right . But I'm still worried . __eou__
Hi , Mark , did you catch the game last night ? __eou__ No , I was out . Was it worth watching ? __eou__ You didn ’ t hear ? Spain won , two to zero . __eou__ Oh , really ? So , Spain is through to the next round ? __eou__ Yeah . The final is next week . You have to watch it . __eou__
How were things in the Tokyo branch when you were there ? __eou__ Good ! They have expanded and are doing better than they were last quarter . It's nice to see some improvement for a change . __eou__ Do you see the trend continuing over the next few months ? __eou__ Yes , especially with so many of our executives going back and forth from here to Japan . The only problem is , they may have trouble when they go to open up business here . __eou__ Why would you say that ? __eou__ They aren't too familiar with doing business outside of Japan . There are a lot of cultural differences to account for . __eou__ I'll say ! Sometimes they just do things really differently . But one thing I can say , they are really hospitable . __eou__ Have you ever been to Japan ? __eou__ Sure ! I just got back yesterday . I'm still suffering from jet lag . __eou__
Morning . __eou__ Hi there Mr . Anderson ! How are you on this fine morning ? __eou__ Fine , thank you . __eou__ It sure is cold this morning , isn ’ t it ? I barely even get out of bed ! __eou__ Yeah . It ’ s pretty cold , alright . __eou__ Did you catch the news this morning ? I heard that there was a fire on Byron Street . __eou__ No , I didn ’ t hear about that . __eou__ Did you happen to watch the football game last night ? The Patriots scored in the last minute ! __eou__ No , I don ’ t like football . __eou__ Oh . . . By the way , I saw you with your daughter at the office Christmas party . She is really beautiful ! __eou__ She ’ s my wife ! Oh , here ’ s my floor ! Nice talking to you . Goodbye . __eou__ Sir this is the 56th floor ! We are on the 70th ! __eou__ That ’ s okay , I ’ ll take the stairs ! __eou__
You look hot and tired . Jack , have you been exercising ? __eou__ Yes . We just had a basketball match with Class Two . __eou__ Who won ? __eou__ They did . __eou__ What was the score ? __eou__ Seventy to sixty-seven . __eou__

Hi , how are you doing ? __eou__ Everything's great . And you ? __eou__ Same here.Have you seen any new films recently ? __eou__ No , I haven't had a chance to . But I have been watching a Chinese TV scries called " Chinese-Style Divorce " . __eou__ Oh . really ? I saw it two years ago . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking . __eou__ Yeah . I found it is so close to our life . __eou__ It reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world . __eou__ You said it . You know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent year . __eou__ Well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend to end quickly too . __eou__ I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married . __eou__ Oh , that's too short-lived . __eou__ That's true . It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s ' generation . __eou__ II can't agree more . The only-child-generation in China tends to know little about marriage . __eou__ Definitely.They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously . __eou__ In their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone . __eou__ I think , as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same with marriage . __eou__
Which is your preference , tea or coffee ? __eou__ My choice would always be tea . __eou__ When did you form this hobby ? __eou__ Last year when I visited China . __eou__
How do you get paid ? If you don't mind my asking . __eou__ Not cash . But if our launch goes well , my stock options will pay off , big time . __eou__ And in the meantime , how do you pay the rent ? __eou__ I don't have to worry about rent . I live right here . __eou__ What ? In your cubicle ? __eou__ Right here . Me and my PC . Home sweet home . __eou__

I am considering going for the new job that was posted yesterday . __eou__ Are you certain that that is what you want to do ? __eou__ It may not be the best choice for me , but I am considering it . __eou__ Why do you think that this would be a good move ? __eou__ I believe that this job would allow me to move up but might be a little boring for me . __eou__ Yes , there are always pros and cons to making a career change . __eou__ Also , the matter of pay is also a consideration . __eou__ I think the slight pay decrease might be worth it . The benefits are much better . __eou__ Yes , sometimes giving up a little to move forward is the best choice . __eou__ I think you should definitely apply for the position . __eou__

What ’ s your city like ? __eou__ It ’ s quite an interesting place to live . The best thing to do in my city is go shopping . There are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls . __eou__ Is the traffic bad in the city centre ? __eou__ Not really . Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . The public transport system is pretty good . __eou__ What about restaurants and entertainment ? __eou__ There are restaurants with food from all over the world . We have a small china-town near the city centre . There are many Indian , Thai , and Italian restaurants all over the city centre . There are many sports events in my city .

Such as pumpkin pies , puddings , mashed potatoes , bread , a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables . __eou__ I'm almost hungry . __eou__
Great party , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Yeah , really . __eou__ By the way , my name is Liu Wei . __eou__ Hi , I ’ m Susan Marshall.You can call me Susan.Nice to meet you . __eou__ What do you do , Susan ? __eou__ Well , I ’ m a college student.How about you ? __eou__ I work for the Bank of China , in the International Section . __eou__ I work for the Bank of China , in the International Section . __eou__
Oh , please ! Don't be so old-fashioned ! It's totally safe . __eou__ I sure hope you didn't trust anyone with your credit card number . __eou__ All I did so far was make a bid on the Buddha . It was easy ! __eou__ Easy ? Ha ! ! It was easy for them to cheat you ! ! __eou__ Oh , come on ! I just gave them my e-mail , my address and my phone number . And my name , of course . __eou__
I think that ’ s settled . __eou__ I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are ! __eou__ How dare you speak to me like this . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__
Honey , I ’ ll be right back ! __eou__ Where are you going ? __eou__ I told you already ! I ’ m going to get my nails done . __eou__ Again ? You just went last week !

I guess I have a minute . __eou__ Do you know about the Bucky Card ? __eou__ I've heard about it , but I don't really know about it . __eou__ The Bucky Card is a great way for you to save money while you have a good time here at school.It gives you discounts on all kinds of things . Movies , pizza , clothing , school supplies . __eou__ What about beer ? __eou__ The Card doesn't actually give you discounts on beer.But it will give you discounts on certain club cover charges.So if you want to see your favorite band at Amy's or Cosmo's Club , you get a discount on the entrance fee . __eou__ That's pretty cool . How much of a discount ? __eou__ Usually it's two dollars off the cover price . __eou__ And all these other things , pizza and movies for instance--how much of a discount do I get on that stuff ? __eou__ This pamphlet shows you what restaurants and movie theaters have discounts.And twice every semester we will send you a new issue of the pamphlet.The Bucky Card has just started.Every couple months we have new businesses joining our program.It ' s a great way for students to save money ! __eou__ Alright , alright .

That can wait . Your promotion is the best news I've heard in a long time ! __eou__ it is good news , but it looked like you were almost finished . We might as well just sign off . __eou__ ok , you're right . I'll just tell them how round I am of you for getting a promotion and then I'll thank Sue for her kind letter . __eou__ I guess you can write that I'm looking forward to seeing them in June . __eou__ that's thoughtful of you . __eou__ and also thank them from the bottom of my heart for the Christmas package they sent us . __eou__ that's right ! I almost forgot about that . __eou__ what would you do without me ? __eou__ we do balance each other out well . I guess we were really made for each other ! __eou__

Hey , Tom . You look tired . Are you all right ? __eou__ I didn't sleep much last night . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ You know Miao Li-my roommate , he bought a computer last month . He has turned his computer into an electronic playground . He plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other games . Every night he keeps me up . __eou__ Don't you like games __eou__ I usually get a lot of information on the computer and use E-mail to send messages to my friends . __eou__ Me too . Recently , I've made many friends on the net . Every day I talk to them and share many interesting things with them . __eou__ Don't you think it's a sheer waste of both time and money ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . To me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information . __eou__ Yes . __eou__
What's the weather like in your city ? __eou__ In the summer it gets very hot.the temperature is often between 37 and 40 centigrade.when it is hot we often get rains.the winters are drier . __eou__ The summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 or25 in my city.the rain falls mostly in the winter.and we often get snow . __eou__ What are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees . __eou__ In winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that.the streets are often icing in the morning.with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms . __eou__ Yeah , we do . in the middle of summer there can be thunderstorms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog , is that true ? __eou__ We do have a few foggy days in winter.but i would not say we have a lot of fogs.the sky are usually clearly over your city , are they ? __eou__ Yes , they are . like i said we have thunderstorms.but each one usually only last a few hours.then the skys are clear again . __eou__ Have you ever had snow in your city ? __eou__ My grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child.but my parents and i only see it outside of our city . __eou__ The river in my city sometime freeze over.people go ice-skating on it.on summer people go boating on the river.but few people go swimming because it is not very clean . __eou__ As you know , my city is on the coast.the water is also not clean.but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot in sunny . __eou__
I used to think that Americans had so much money they didn ’ t know what to do with it . __eou__ You did ? __eou__ Yes . But now I ’ Ve learned differently . Now I have a more realistic opinion . __eou__ What do you think now ? __eou__ There are lots of jobs , and almost everybody works . There is a high standard of living . People earn a lot , but they spend a lot to live . So there isn ’ t so much money after all . __eou__ But I still say Americans spend a lot more money on useless things than we Chinese do . __eou__ That ’ s true . But Americans work hard for their money like we do . I don ’ t know why our spending habits are so different . __eou__
I am exhausted . I need some sleep . __eou__ Didn ’ t you sleep well last night ? __eou__ I twisted and turned all night , and couldn ’ t sleep . I was worried about my mother ’ s health . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . It ’ s only a cold . __eou__
Fairly warm this morning , isn't it ? __eou__ You're right.The air is so warm and everything looks so fresh and green . __eou__ Say , how about a walk along the river ? __eou__ Marvelous idea ? __eou__
How do you like other films starring Charlie Chaplin ? __eou__ Well , I like others very much , but I really don't think much of this one . __eou__ You don't like the performance , do you ? __eou__ Yes , but I don't like the story . __eou__
Lots of elderly people want peace and quiet in their old age , but young people want an unconstrained life . __eou__ It would be good for both if they lived separately . My parents want to live apart from us . __eou__ What if old people are in poor health and need to be looked after ? __eou__ Young people ought to carry out their responsibilities . If it's needed , they would live with their parents . __eou__ When I ’ m old , I ’ ll also be like that . __eou__ You need a child first , and that's your duty , too . __eou__ I know that's what I must do . __eou__
I went to visit a customer in IVS Company the other day . Their offices were very impressive , especially their company Logo which is all over the place . There are Logo models in metal , copper , clove , paper . They are even printed on the wall paper and the balls of the table-lights . It is really decorated identity . __eou__ It is just too much . Don ’ t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ? __eou__ Not at all ! I like the design so much . The designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept . __eou__ Wow , I doubt that . __eou__
Oh , Linda . You must be so excited about going to study in America . __eou__ Oh yes I am . I have always wanted to go to the States . I love meeting new people and making new friends . __eou__ Well , I am sure you will . __eou__ Well , there is one thing . __eou__ What is the matter ? __eou__ I am a little worried about my host family . You know , in the agreement , I have to do some cooking for them . __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ Well , I am just afraid they won't like my Chinese way of cooking . __eou__ Oh , listen , you'll soon learn , and I am sure they will explain to you how they like to get prepared . __eou__ Oh , let's hope so . __eou__
So what did you think about the movie ? __eou__ Well , I think this Star Wars episode is an excellent piece of work , but not as good as the previous ones . __eou__ Really ? I don't agree . This Star Wars episode was incredible ! __eou__ Why do you think so ? __eou__ Well , one of the most spectacular things about this one was the special effects . State of the art special effects are the main reason for the success of previous episodes , so audiences have high expectations for this one , and I don't think they will be disappointed . __eou__ You are right . The special effects were amazing . And I like the fact that they created so many fantastic settings and otherworldly costumes , weapons and creatures . __eou__ It's kind of cool that they are still using the same Star Wars theme song for this movie . __eou__ Yeah ! It reminds me of the previous Star Wars scenes . __eou__ I know exactly what you mean . Hearing that song gives me a nostalgic feeling . __eou__ I thought the overall plot of the movie was very interesting , but I don't think the character development was that strong . __eou__ Do you think that they had anything to do with the casting of the movie ? __eou__ No , the casting is great and the actors were excellent . They just didn ’ t have a lot of funny or meaningful dialogues . The writing was also a little weak . __eou__ Well , maybe . But I like the little kid who played Manakin Skywalker . I can't imagine anyone else playing that role . __eou__ I liked him too . He is so cute ! You know , even though I was slightly disappointed , I can't wait for the next episode . I wonder when they ’ re going to start making it and when it ’ s scheduled for release ? __eou__ I've no idea . But looking at the success of Star Wars episode , I've a strong feeling production for the next episode will be selling pretty soon . I hope It will be even better than this one . __eou__ I hope so , too . __eou__ Well , I think we should go now . It's getting pretty late . __eou__ Okay , let's go ! __eou__
Well , you know what , don ’ t do it , ‘ cause the minute you do , they lose all respect for you . __eou__ Well , it ’ s not like that . We just e-mail , it ’ s really nothing . On top of which I am definitely thinking about stopping because it ’ s getting ... __eou__ Out of hand . __eou__ Confusing . But not , because it ’ s nothing . __eou__ Where ’ d you meet him ? __eou__ Oh , listen , I can ’ t even remember . Ok , on my birthday , I wandered into over 30 rooms , for a joke , sort of and he was there , and we started chatting ... __eou__ About what ? __eou__ Oh , books , and music , how much we both love New York . Harmless , harmless , meaningless . Bouquets of sharpened pencils . Oh . __eou__ Excuse me ? __eou__ Forget it . We don ’ t talk about anything personal , so I don ’ t know his name or what he does or where he lives exactly . So it ’ ll be really easy for me to stop seeing him , because I ’ m not ... __eou__
What's so special today ? __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Didn't you notice all the roses ? __eou__ It's July 7th . Chinese Valentine's Day ! __eou__ Oh , God .

It's not fair . You forgot it too . __eou__ Oh , it's Clive . __eou__ Wow ! Good timing . __eou__ Excuse me for a while.Clive asked me out to a movie ! Do you want to join us ? __eou__ Come on . Two is company . __eou__ So what ? __eou__ It's Valentine's Day . Come on . Just go . __eou__
John , I ’ d like you to meet Charles Brown , our new manager at the airport . __eou__ Yes , certainly . How can I recognize him ? __eou__ He is short , well-built , and he ’ s got light blond hair . __eou__ Is there anything else ? __eou__ He has a mustache , if I remember correctly , and a light complexion . __eou__ How old is he ? __eou__ He is in his late thirties . __eou__ Well . I shouldn ’ t have any trouble recognizing him . What time does his flight arrive ? __eou__ At two thirty . __eou__

What's wrong ? __eou__ Oh , Steven , I made a big mistake . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I really wish I hadn ’ t done it . __eou__ What on earth are you talking about ? __eou__ I got caught cheating . I feel so ashamed . The teacher saw me and told me I failed . __eou__ What were you thinking ? __eou__ You know my father . If I fail , he'll kill me . I have to do well . __eou__ But what you should do is study hard . __eou__ I know ... I know ... it's all my fault .

I have to meet someone . __eou__ It's been nice talking to you . __eou__ Good-bye . See you again sometime . __eou__

I didn ’ t go to sleep until quite late . __eou__ Then when did you go to sleep ? __eou__ About 2 o ’ clock in the morning . __eou__ When ? __eou__ About 2 o ’ clock . __eou__ Oh , Susie . Didn ’ t I tell you over and over again that you wouldn ’ t be able to climb the mountain unless you got enough sleep ? __eou__ You did , but I can ’ t help it . __eou__ This is a one-day trip . We ’ ll have to keep going and try to reach the top by noon or give up right now and go home . Which one do you choose ? __eou__ Which one do I choose ? I don ’ t want to give up , but I really feel tired . __eou__ So , make up your mind quickly . Whether to keep going or give up . __eou__ Let me think about it . What should I do ? I think I will not give up . __eou__
Man , that sunset is beautiful . I ’ Ve never seen one so red . __eou__ Yeah , it ’ s pretty nice , but its so red because of air pollution . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yeah , the smog from all these cars gets into the air and turns the sunlight red . __eou__ I never knew that . __eou__ Yeah , more people need to take public transportation or carpool . __eou__ Well , we ’ Ve already done our part . __eou__ Yeah , it ’ s your turn to drive next week . Don ’ t be late picking me up . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . I ’ m getting more sleep these days .

He likes children and always wants a child of his own . __eou__ In fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese . __eou__ Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ? __eou__ It ’ s still a mystery . Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant . But she begins to take her maternity leave now . __eou__ Oh ! You mean she doesn ’ t have to work now ? It ’ s hard for young parents not to overreact , isn ’ t it ? __eou__

It has to be smooth to go in . __eou__ It won't go in ! __eou__ Just remember that you might have to feed the money in a couple of times to get it to work . __eou__ Yes , next step . __eou__ Make your selection and hope for the best . Vending machines aren't all that reliable . __eou__ They're totally unreliable . __eou__ You seem to have it down . Have a good day ! __eou__

In other words , I don't want to be a millionaire and I want to have more free time to enjoy life . __eou__ Oh , I see . But a proverb says " Money makes the mare go . " I think it will be better if you have more money . __eou__ Maybe you are right . Please take care of yourself when you make money . Anyway health is the most important thing . __eou__ Thank you for your caring . I will . __eou__ No thanks . __eou__
It's the 17th week now , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ Oh , the final exam is coming soon . I feel a little bit nervous . __eou__ Take it easy . There is still one more week left before the exam begins . Have you prepared for it well ? __eou__ No , I haven't began my preparations . __eou__ Then shall we make preparations together ? __eou__ Great . You can help me a lot with English . __eou__ All right . But I am very poor at math . Would you like to help me with my math ? __eou__ No problem . __eou__
Have you ever been to any other country ? __eou__ Pity I haven't . If I can afford it , I'll certainly take a trip abroad . __eou__ That's also my dream . __eou__ How about going to italy next summer vacation ? __eou__ Why not ? __eou__
You are blue in the face , arn't you ? __eou__ The cat has eaten my fish , I'll kill it . __eou__ But supposing your son killed like the fish , what do you think then ? __eou__ I'll beat him . __eou__ So beat the cat , but don't kill it . __eou__
You ’ re all set now ? __eou__ Oh , thank you so much . __eou__ Really , it was nothing . __eou__ I really appreciated it . __eou__ I was happy to help . __eou__ It was so kind of you . __eou__ Don ’ t mention it . __eou__ You ’ re a real friend in need . __eou__
Let's get together this weekend . __eou__ Sounds good . __eou__

I'd like to change my job . __eou__ What sort of job do you have in mind ? __eou__ I think I'm quite fit for a driver . __eou__ But it's very tired . __eou__ I don't care . __eou__ What's your parents ' opinion ? __eou__ I haven't told them . Maybe I'll make them know after the vacation . __eou__

How about you ? __eou__ I'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there . Have you ever been there before ? __eou__ yes , I went there once last summer . __eou__ really ? What did you think ? __eou__ I think it is amazing . You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway . __eou__ was it that crowded ? __eou__ yes . There were always so many people . After taking the subway during the rush hour , you ’ ll envy sardines in their cans . __eou__ oh , maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car . __eou__ that's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation ! __eou__ thank you very much ! __eou__
Do you like watching TV ? __eou__ Yes I do , usually . __eou__ What do you exactly mean by usually ? __eou__ I don't like spending time on commercials.There ' re too many commercials on TV . __eou__
We're forming a study group to prepare for the finals . Do you want to join us ? __eou__ But the semester just started ? Why the rush ? __eou__ After you try it once this way , I don't think you'll ever put off studying till the end again . __eou__ How often do you meet ? __eou__ We plan to get together once a week . __eou__ What days , do you know ? __eou__ We were talking about Wednesday evenings at the library , from seven to eight . __eou__ Okay , count me in . __eou__
What is wrong with Peter ? He sure looks unhappy . __eou__ His girlfriend dumped him , and he is tearing his heart out over her . __eou__ How foolish he is . The girl is inviting . She often makes a pass at boys . __eou__ Love is blind , you know . __eou__
Can you lend me your car ? __eou__ Nothing ' doing . __eou__
Peter , which club do you want to join ? __eou__ I haven't decided yet . What about you , Andy ? __eou__ I am a member of the basketball club . Do you want to join us ? __eou__ But I don't know how to play basketball . __eou__ It's OK . Don't worry about it . Our school coach will train us to play basketball . __eou__
You ’ re all set now ? __eou__ Oh , thank you so much . __eou__ Really , it was nothing . __eou__ I really appreciated it . __eou__ I was happy to help . __eou__ It was so kind of you . __eou__ Don ’ t mention it . __eou__ You ’ re a real friend in need . __eou__
Hi , Jason ! __eou__ Hi , Linda . I have two concert complimentary tickets . Will you go with me tonight ? __eou__ With the greatest pleasure ! Where is the concert held this evening ? __eou__ It will be held at the Central Music Hall . __eou__ What is on the program ? __eou__ It ’ s a piano solo . I'm fond of piano , you know . __eou__ Hah ! OK . Let ’ s go together ! __eou__ Let ’ s meet at the park at 6:00 . __eou__ See you then . __eou__

So we often come here . __eou__ How often ? __eou__ Well , we come here almost every month . __eou__ Who ’ s that ? __eou__ It ’ s my mother . She ’ s fond of swimming . And the man beside her is my father . __eou__ Do you like swimming ? __eou__ No , I hate swimming . I prefer playing tennis . __eou__
What shall I call him ? __eou__ Oh , you may call him Uncle , or Henry . __eou__ What's he doing ? __eou__ He's checking bags.He ' s an official in the customs . __eou__
Hi , John ! How was your vacation ? __eou__ We went to Malaysia and Thailand . __eou__ That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ? __eou__ Well . We went bungee jumping when we were in Malaysia . __eou__ Wow , isn't that dangerous ? __eou__ A little , but the rush was worth it . __eou__ Tell me about it . __eou__ We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us . __eou__ 500 feet ! I would never be able to do that . __eou__ Yeah , It was scary but exhilarating . __eou__
It's a lovely day , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , the weather sure is nice today . __eou__ I love it when the weather is like this.Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ? __eou__ That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot . __eou__ I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado ; but I must admit , this sure is a nice spring day . __eou__ Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable . __eou__ Okay.Hey , is that a dark cloud over there ? Do you think it will rain after all ? __eou__ I don't think so . I say the weather report last night , and it said the weather should be fine all day . __eou__ If the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend.It ' s been a while since I've not really gotten some sun . __eou__
Did you go to the movie yesterday ? __eou__ Yes , I did . __eou__ What did you think of it ? __eou__ I don't think much of the film . __eou__ I think it is the worst one I have ever seen . __eou__ Oh , I'm not sure I agree with you . It was not a good one , but it was not the worst one . Actually , it wasn't too bad . __eou__ I can't think the same . __eou__ What's more , some scenes were good , much fit for the children . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you . __eou__
There has been talk at school about canceling the concert . __eou__ Really ? Who did you hear that from ? __eou__ Just word of mouth . __eou__
Do you have the notes from last week's class ? __eou__ Did you come late ? __eou__ I couldn't make it . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ I was sick . __eou__ Oh , okay . Well , here you go . __eou__ Are these all of them ? __eou__ Oh , wait , here are the rest . __eou__ Thanks a bunch . __eou__ Don't mention it . __eou__
Excuse me , Professor . I think there might be an error in my test score . __eou__ Sure . Do you think that the total is wrong or that you got something marked wrong that should have been marked right ? __eou__ I think that the percentage is incorrect . __eou__ Let's just go over all of it to double-check . __eou__ Sure , let's do it . __eou__ Here is the answer sheet . Do you see a place where I marked something wrong that should have been right ? __eou__ I don't see any mistakes . __eou__ OK , now that we've gotten those straightened out , let's total the score . __eou__ Yes , let's total it . __eou__ Well , if I total that like this and divide by this number , I get this total . Do you agree ? __eou__ Yes , you're right . __eou__ Well then , we are all straight . Have a good day and thanks for bringing that to my attention . __eou__
A new film is on.Have you ever seen it ? __eou__ What kind of movie is it ? __eou__ It's a feature film . __eou__ Oh , I've no interest in such films . __eou__
Mary , I heard you moved again . __eou__ Yeah . I could not stand living here . There is always much noise in the neighborhood . __eou__ You mean noise ? How could it be ? __eou__ You know , on weekends when we wanted to have late rise in the morning , our neighbour started to raise Cain . __eou__
What do you think of your teacher ? __eou__ He's very strict with us . __eou__ And I hear he gives very good lectures . __eou__ Indeed . He's strict with himself too . We can see every lecture of his is well-prepared . __eou__
What do you want to do tomorrow night ? __eou__ What--is tomorrow night something special ? __eou__ It's Friday . We should go party . __eou__ I don't need to drink every weekend . I could be happy just staying home , you know . __eou__ Okay . Stay home Sunday . But Friday we should go out dancing . __eou__ Do you feel like dancing ? __eou__ Yes ? Why not ? __eou__ Alright.At least that's better than sitting in a bar with your alcoholic friends . __eou__ They aren't alcoholic ! __eou__ No , maybe they're not . But they're close . __eou__ So where should we go ? __eou__ Let's go to the Latin Club . I think they will have a Brazilian band there this weekend . Maybe it's Friday night . __eou__ You always want to go to the Latin Club . I don't know those dance steps . I'd rather go to the New Bar . __eou__ The New Bar is all techno music on Friday night.You really want to dance to that ? __eou__ It's not all techno music . It's not a special techno night . __eou__ No . But they play techno all the time . It drives me crazy after forty minutes.And anyhow , if we go to the Latin Club you could actually learn some Latin dance steps.At the New Bar you'll just shake yourself around for an hour.And then you'll get sick of stand you'll want to go get drunk somewhere where the drinks are cheaper . I know you . __eou__ It's fine with me if we go to the Latin Club . I like Latin Music.The only thing I never want to do again is listen to country rock.What was that bar called ? __eou__ Oh . You mean Jerry's , over on the east side.That wasn't my idea going there . __eou__ No . It was that friend of yours , Melissa.Her and all her lousy country music Cds . Yecch ! __eou__ It's true . I would never go there again either.Country music is a nightmare . So is it the Latin Club ? __eou__ Yes . You have to teach me the samba , and the tango , and whatever else they do . __eou__ Well , it seems you'll have to learn some Spanish too , won't you ? __eou__ Maybe . __eou__
David , do you think we are lucky to have the weekend ? __eou__ Definitely . I need to have enough time to have a rest on this weekend . We worked like bees in the whole working days . __eou__ I agree with you . What do you want to do , except sleeping ? __eou__ Let me think . Oh , awful ! I still have not finished the chart which was assigned by Mr . Wharton on Friday . So that task will make my busy . __eou__ I am better . I will go out to have a visit to my aunt . Why don't we have fun on weekend ? __eou__ So what ? __eou__
And what's your vision ? __eou__ 20/350 . __eou__ Mine's 20/20 . Life just isn't fair , is it ? __eou__ Oh , yes , it is . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ You'll find out when we're in the woods and you have to go to the bathroom ... __eou__ They don't have toilets at the campground ? __eou__ Let's just say I'll have it easy ... __eou__
A funny thing happened to me the other day . __eou__ Oh , yes ? __eou__ I was just thinking about someone I went to school with , this boy I was quite friendly with in third grade . We used to hang out together - he lived next door - but then my parents moved and I changed schools and never saw him again . __eou__ Mmm . __eou__ Well , I was walking down Nan Jing Dong Lu ( Nan-Jing E . Rd . ) during my lunch break thinking about this boy-I have no idea why I was thinking about him . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . And suddenly I heard someone call my name . I turned around and there was this man looking at me . I didn't recognize him at all , but he obviously knew who I was . __eou__ Oh , yeah , that's embarrassing when that happens . __eou__ You got it . Well , he walked up to me and said my name again and then I realized it was the boy I had been thinking about , the one from third grade ! __eou__
You look tired . Did you sleep well last night ? __eou__ I stayed up all night writing a report . __eou__ Go easy . Overwork is bad for your health . __eou__
Hi , how ’ re you doing ? __eou__ Terrible . __eou__ Oh , what ’ s the matter ? __eou__ I ’ Ve got a fever and really a bad headache . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s too bad . Why don ’ t you take some aspirin ? __eou__ I ’ Ve already tried some but it didn ’ t help . __eou__ Well , it ’ s necessary for you to see a doctor . __eou__ Yeah , I guess I should . __eou__ Well , you ’ d better get some rest . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
Did you hear the news ? Two of our major suppliers , Murphy Music and U-Tunes are merging ! If they are conglomerated into one company into one company , it would have some serious affects on our market strategy . __eou__ Are you sure ? Who told you that ? I highly doubt that they would take the step to merge into one company ... They're supposed to be bitter enemies , the strictest of competitors.It must be a rumor.It can't be true . __eou__ I read it myself on the financial page.They ' re really going to join together . U-Tunes was bought out by Murphy's , they will take over the company as of next month . __eou__ The competition must have been too stiff for U-Tunes.Otherwise why would they allow themselves to be taken over by their sworn enemy ? __eou__ I guess they must have figured it would be easier to merge than to keep up the cutthroat competition.If you can't beat'em , join'em . __eou__
Daniel , would you like to have a look at my dorm ? __eou__ Of course , I'd like to . __eou__ It is a small room , just for 4 people . __eou__ What is in it ? __eou__ It only has 4 beds and 4 writing desks , but it is spacious and bright . __eou__ Do you get along with your roommates ? __eou__ Of course . They are very friendly . __eou__ Which floor are you on ? __eou__ We are on the 5th floor , and there's a very nice view from the balcony . __eou__ Oh , you can climb the stairs as a workout . __eou__ Yes , that's a good idea . __eou__ Wow , your roommates are cleaning the room . __eou__ Let's give them a hand . __eou__
I like hitchhiking.will you go with me ? __eou__ Oh , no . I don't think I'm in that good form . __eou__ It's a pity.Say , how about a place near enough ? __eou__ To where exactly ? __eou__ New England . __eou__ That's still too far for me . __eou__
Excuse me . Nature calls . __eou__ If you gotta go , you gotta go . __eou__
Julia , will you be my wife ? __eou__ I'm sorry , Steven . __eou__ Please , Julia , I have made proposal to you five times . I really want to share the rest of my life with you . __eou__ I know . But I ’ m not ready for married life yet . __eou__ Julia , I really love you . I hope I can stay with you no matter you are happy or sad in future . __eou__ Your way does touch my heart . __eou__ So , will you marry me ? __eou__ I want to think of it for some time . __eou__
Yeah , it's really cute . But why a monkey suit ? Is Hello Kitty having an identity complex ? __eou__ No , she's wearing my Chinese zodiac sign . __eou__ You were born in the year of the monkey ? __eou__ Yeah , are you surprised ? __eou__ Not at all ! That explains everything ! __eou__
What's the time ? My watch has stopped . __eou__ Let me see . It's five minutes to eleven . __eou__ Is your watch right ? __eou__ I think so . I see it by the radio this morning . __eou__
How long will it take to learn English ? Will I be able to take other courses next semester or will English take up all of my time ? __eou__ It ’ s hard to say . Language isn ’ t like other studies . __eou__ You mean I could finish this course and still not know English ? You ’ Ve got to be kidding ! __eou__ I ’ m not kidding . Learning a language is a question of forming language habits and that takes time . __eou__ So do we have to stay in this English class forever ? __eou__ No . You just have to stay here long enough to get some orientation . Then you go on practicing and learning outside . A lot of learning depends on your personal motivation . __eou__ So it ’ s really the same story . Practice , practice , practice and more practice is the only way to learn a language . __eou__ You said it . __eou__
How nice it is here __eou__ You can say that again . The sunny shining and there ’ s pleasant raise . it ’ s so lovely __eou__ I ’ Ve heard the whether here is ideal , just like spring most of the year __eou__ That ’ s correct . we have four seasons of spring __eou__
You're going to get into a lot of trouble if you do that . __eou__ What makes you say that ? __eou__ I don't see anything wrong with what we're doing ! That's just the problem . In these kind of things , the trouble doesn't always appear at first . __eou__ But everything has been so easy . __eou__ Everything has gone as smooth as clockwork . Just like we planned ! That may be true , but if you were to do it , you would have trouble on the horizon . You always say that . __eou__ Yeah , you never look at the positive side of things . __eou__ Okay . Have it your way , but don't say I didn't warn you . __eou__
Excuse me , is this seat taken ? __eou__ Er ... no , go ahead . __eou__ You work upstair , right ? I think I have seen you before . I'm Karren , Karren Brown . __eou__ Nice to meet you , Karren . I'm Tim Wang . __eou__ Happy to know you , Tim . __eou__
I can bet the farm that you will regret about your decision . You cannot find a better one . __eou__ How can you be so sure ? You haven ’ t been together with her , have you ? __eou__ No . But I ’ m sure she is a good girl . My sixth sense tells me so . __eou__ Then try it yourself . __eou__
Betty , would you please read this letter of application I've just written ? I'd like to have your opinion . __eou__ I'd be glad to tell you what I think . __eou__ Good ! I'm interested in your advice . __eou__ If I were you , I would change the beginning . You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities . __eou__ Good idea , Betty . What would you think about the second part ? __eou__ I think it's too short . You'd better say something about your work experience . __eou__ You're right , I'll change it . How about the last part ? __eou__ Very good . But you should talk about your family , too . __eou__ I agree . I appreciate your helping me . __eou__
I see you have bought the latest copy of beauty and fashion . Are there any interesting articles in it ? __eou__ There ’ s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions . I enjoyed reading her thought . The which ? section is very interesting this month . They tested facial cleaners . T __eou__ I like to take the tests that they print in this magazine . __eou__ Which tests do you mean ? __eou__ You know . Tests like how jealous are you ? and are you a fashion victim ? __eou__ Oh , I see . I like to do those tests , too , but I don ’ t take them seriously . __eou__ Of course not , but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do . According to the jealousy test , I ’ m quite a jealous type of person . Perhaps I need to control my jealousy . __eou__ You ’ re right . It ’ s sometimes hard to tell which pages are advertisement and which ones are articles . __eou__
If I can improve my vertical jump a few more inches , I think beach volleyball might be my ticket . __eou__ But whenever we play , you just sit on the sand , drink beer , and watch the girls ! __eou__ It's a beautiful sport , isn't it ? __eou__ To be honest , I don't think you could even win a gold in hopscotch ! __eou__ OK , OK . Enough already . We'd better hustle . The contest starts in five minutes . __eou__
Will it be all right to visit you this evening ? __eou__ I'm sorry , but I have an appointment this evening.How about tomorrow evening ? __eou__ It's fine with me . __eou__
How is night life in Beijing ? __eou__ Very interesting ! __eou__ What do you suggest then ? __eou__ How about going to dance ? There is a very good nightclub nearby . __eou__ That's a great idea . Let's go ... Oh , the dance hall looks very nice and the music is wonderful . __eou__ I'm glad you like it.The band is called " Four and One " . They are especially good at playing rock and roll . __eou__ That's great ! I love to dance to fast music . __eou__ Then you must be interested in disco dancing , aren't you ? __eou__ Yes , disco dancing is my favorite.It ' s great fun and good exercise as well . __eou__ OK . Let's disco . __eou__ Now the band is playing a slow dance . __eou__ That's a waltz . Would you like to try it ? __eou__ Sorry , I think I'Il sit out the next dance . __eou__ All right . Let me get you something to drink . __eou__
Just remember . The main thing right now is to make sure Stars.com is happy . __eou__ Right . You're right . But she's just evil . Someone should drive a stake through her heart . __eou__ Elvin , please . Can I count on you to keep your cool for a week , or not ? __eou__ I'm OK . I'll be fine . I'v cool . I'm cold . I'm like ice . She won't know what hit her . __eou__ By the way , how's the nose ? Boy , that must have hurt . __eou__
What do you need ? __eou__ I would like to check out a book . __eou__ I ’ m going to need your library card . __eou__ I don ’ t have a library card . __eou__ Why don ’ t you apply for one right now ? __eou__ Sure . That would be great . __eou__ Please fill out this application . __eou__ Okay . Here you go . __eou__ Now , sign your name on the back of the card . __eou__ Here you go . __eou__ Here ’ s your library card . __eou__ Thanks . Now I ’ d like to check out this book . __eou__
I can ’ t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice ! __eou__ Why not ! It ’ s a classic ; in fact , it ’ s one of my favorite novels . __eou__ But it ’ s so old . __eou__ Don ’ t judge a book by its cover . Do you Kwon what it ’ s about ? __eou__ No , not at all . __eou__ First of all , it ’ s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century . __eou__ I didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . What ’ s the main storyline ? __eou__ It ’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls . __eou__ Why does he want to do that ? __eou__ Since he doesn ’ t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for . __eou__ Won ’ t they get his inheritance ? __eou__ No , that ’ s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing . __eou__ I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all . __eou__ So , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ? __eou__ There ’ s movie ? My teacher didn ’ t tell me that ! __eou__ That ’ s probably because she wants you to read the book first . __eou__ It would take a lot less time .. __eou__ How about this . When you finish the book . I ’ ll get the movie and watch it with you . __eou__ Ok . That sounds like a deal . __eou__
What is the matter with him ? __eou__ I don't know , what's wrong ? __eou__ I feel he is as cold as charity to me . __eou__ Maybe you should ask him openly . __eou__
Are there many idioms in English ? __eou__ There are hundreds and hundreds . English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions . __eou__ Can you give us an example ? __eou__ I'll look up the rate . To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . It means to search for and find some information . __eou__ What about the expression " goodbye " ? Is that an idiom ? __eou__ That is just a natural , grammatical English expression . It has a direct translation in other languages . __eou__ This is interesting , Ms.Parker . __eou__
Good morning , Mr.Black . I am the new secretary . __eou__ Good morning , Miss White . You are half an hour early . __eou__ I don't want to make a bad impression . __eou__ Come on over . This is your desk , and this is your time card . Be sure to clock in and out before and after you work . __eou__ I will . __eou__ One more thing , keep your desk neat . It's the rule . There is no exception , even the art designers have to keep their desks neat . __eou__ I'll keep that in mind . Does everything on the desk belong to me ? __eou__ Not belong . You can use them as long as you work here . When you quit , you ’ ll have to return them to the company . __eou__ What's the extension number for my phone ? __eou__ The operator will put all your calls through . You don't have to worry about that . __eou__ Can I make personal phone calls during my office hours ? __eou__ Of course you can . Every one has his personal matters to deal with more or less , but don't chat over the phone . What's more , don't let it hinder your work and the company's business . __eou__ I understand . __eou__ When you settle down , I'll show you around and introduce you to the department managers . __eou__
Oh ! I just want to drop in on him for a chat . __eou__ Please come in , Mr.Jackson . __eou__ No , thank you.Please tell him to phone me when he comes back . __eou__
When in Rome , do as the Romans do , they say . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Roman is living in Rome , of course . And go to work by car , or bus , or on foot . __eou__ I think the Romans do what everyone else does . __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ And Roman really loves life . He knows how to enjoy himself . __eou__ Not always . But they like good meal . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ How can I go there to have a taste ? __eou__ By air of course . __eou__
it seems the department still has some money left in the budget . Do you have any suggestions how to use it before the budget is renewed ? __eou__ what about renting a restaurant and treating the employees to a nice dinner ? __eou__ but we've done that many times . We want something fresh this time . __eou__ okay , let me think . What about a party-and-movie night ? We can rearrange our reference room , invite a band to play some music , order in some food and watch a movie later . __eou__ sounds like a good idea , but a band sounds too expensive . __eou__ well , we can ask people to make small contributions . __eou__ I don ' t think so . I don't think people are going to like it if they have to pay to come . But we certainly can cut costs in other ways , such as make the party BYOB . __eou__ BYOB ? What's that ? __eou__ bring your own beverage . We can provide food , but people have to bring their own drinks . __eou__ so we're just going to have a party where they bring their own drinks and we just give them some snacks ? I don't know how well that will go over . __eou__ maybe you have a point . How about having a party on a Friday afternoon ? We'll stop early , order some pizza , and serve drinks . There'll be music but no band . Having the party in the office will make __eou__ oh , that sounds like fun ! __eou__
just don't understand why we have to take the subway . Look at this place . It's modern enough . But it's far from lively . __eou__ It's convenient . People in network go everywhere by subway if they don't drive . __eou__ This isn't network , Frida . We are in San Francisco . __eou__ What's the difference ? __eou__ We haven't come here in business but for pleasure . We should go out exciting . What can you see in the subway ? Nothing ! __eou__ What can you see from a tram or a double-decker ? __eou__ I can see people who are walking on the sidewalk . I can see cars driving on the streets . I can see the sun shining and beautiful flowers dancing in the wind . I can even smell the scent of flowers and the freshness of the air . __eou__ But they are not as convenient as the subway . __eou__ You miss the point ! We are not in a hurry to go anywhere . __eou__ Well , maybe you are right . We'll be more amused in a tram or a double-decker than on the subway . __eou__ I'm so glad you can finally see things in my way . Can we leave this dull place now ? __eou__ What about the tickets ? I've already bought them . __eou__ Just throw them away ! __eou__
It is really exciting news . __eou__ What news ? __eou__ You don ’ t know ? The company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones . __eou__ You know what we will get ? __eou__ We will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily . And if you come back to office , you just reconnect your laptop with docking station . __eou__ What docking station ? __eou__ This is a kind of socket mounted to your desk . The socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments , like fax , copier , a screen , printer and scanner , and it will be very convenient . __eou__ Another big step forward in saving on our office equipment , I don ’ t need a desktop anymore . A laptop is enough . __eou__
Mary , I have something to tell you . __eou__ Go ahead . __eou__ I ’ m afraid you ’ ll become angry . But I think I must tell you . __eou__ Come on . Don ’ t hesitate . __eou__ John made out with other girls at the party yesterday . __eou__
I'd like to talk to you about my grades . __eou__ Sure ! What exactly do you have questions about ? __eou__ I am worried that I messed up on a test . __eou__ Well , let me take a look at my grade book . How do YOU think you are doing ? __eou__ I think I am doing great , except for that one test ! __eou__ Well , your scores show that you could do a little better . What do you think you could improve on ? __eou__ I think that I could study a little harder for tests . __eou__ Fine ! Please remember that regular attendance is the most important way to begin . __eou__ Yes , I know . __eou__ I'm sure you'll do fine . __eou__
Sandra is actually blue chipper . I don't think she could realize that she has married a fool for women . __eou__ That's fate . __eou__ I feel sorry for her . __eou__ Maybe this is God's will . __eou__
good morning ! __eou__ good morning , Gav ! Did you sleep well last night ? __eou__ I slept like a baby . I fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have nay nightmares ! __eou__ that's great news ! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday . __eou__ I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something . __eou__ what's that ? __eou__ well , I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic . __eou__ that's annoying , but nothing to worry about . __eou__ for me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ? __eou__ just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset . __eou__ Ok , I'll try that . __eou__ is there anything else bothering you ? __eou__ just one more thing . A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do . __eou__ do you have any other plans this weekend ? __eou__ I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday . __eou__ try not to take on more than you can handle . __eou__ you're right . I probably should just work on my paper . Thanks ! __eou__
Do you want to hear a funny joke ? __eou__ OK . Are you sure it's funny , though ? __eou__ Well , you'll see . __eou__ OK . __eou__ OK , an Englishman , a Scotsman , and an Irishman were going on a trip across the desert , and they could only take one thing with them . __eou__ I see . __eou__ So they met up at the start of the journey and showed each other their equipment . __eou__ Oh , that's funny ! __eou__ Hang on , I haven't finished yet . __eou__ Oh , sorry . __eou__ Well , as I was saying , they showed each other what they had decided to bring . The Englishman had brought some water . " If we get thirsty , we'll have something to drink , " he said . The Scotsman brought a map . " If we get lost , we'll be able to find our way . " The Irishman had brought a car door . __eou__ A car door ? You mean just one car door ? __eou__ Yep . A car door . " Why the door ? " the others asked him . " Well , " he said , “ If it gets hot , we can open the window . " Do you get it ? __eou__ Well ... __eou__
Have you ever run into a person who tries bleed you white ? __eou__ I am always on the look out for such girls . __eou__ I hear that some guys splash all their money about on them . __eou__ Mark is one of them . He has trouble with a girl who turned out to be a dead beat . __eou__
I ’ m sorry , Sam . I don ’ t want to foc-concert . __eou__ How about going to the theatre ? __eou__ I don ’ t like going to the theatre . __eou__ Well , what do you like doing ? __eou__ traveling , swimming , going to the cinema .

There ’ s one of xinghai exhibitions hall tomorrow . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . __eou__
I find Beijing Opera is quite a bore . __eou__ Young people enjoy pop songs more . __eou__ It's just like listening to a language which you know nothing at all . __eou__ But you don't have such a problem as to pop songs . __eou__
You are married to a foreigner , huh ? So what ’ s it like ? __eou__ Well , the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulty getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts . __eou__ Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures . __eou__ And now we have a two-year-old boy . We ’ re very happy that he ’ s healthy and smart . __eou__ Oh , so he ’ s half Chinese and half American . That ’ s unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? __eou__ Right now he speaks mostly Chinese , and he can say a few English words . But he will learn . __eou__ What does he look like ? Can people tell ? __eou__ Yes , people surely can . He ’ s whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though . __eou__

We import some iron and a lot of aluminium from neighbouring countries . __eou__ I heard that you country recently discovered deposits of precious stone . __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . So far , only small deposits have been found . Engineers in my country are focusing on drilling for oil . The government is keen to exploit our natural resources to get money to improve our country . __eou__ If your government invests in your country ’ s infrastructure , it will be money well spent . __eou__ Yes . We need to put the money into long-term projects rather than wasting it on short-term ones . __eou__

It's a typical Hollywood blockbuster . __eou__ Isn't that the chick flick with Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson ? __eou__ Yeah , I suppose you wouldn't want to see that , huh ? __eou__ Not really . Do you like biographical / drama films ? __eou__ It depends on who the film is about . Which movie did you have in mind ? __eou__ Anne Hathaway is in a new movie called Becoming Jane which is based on a true story about Jane Austen . __eou__ That sounds fantastic ! What time is it playing ? __eou__ It's on at 8 pm at the Phoenix Theatres . I have a membership there , so I can book the tickets ahead of time . __eou__ Great .

I ’ Ve seen that , too . We could go for a walk in the park . __eou__ We could , but it looks like it ’ s going to rain soon . __eou__ I guess that ’ s out . Why don ’ t we go shopping ? __eou__ I ’ d really rather not . I ’ ll be too tempted to buy something that I can ’ t afford ! __eou__ Ok . I guess we ’ d be not do that , either , then . What do you want to do ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . Do you want to go bowling at the new bowling alley on 1st street ? __eou__ I would like to , but I injured my wrist last weekend . __eou__ Let ’ s see . Do you want to go to a bar and sing some karaoke ? __eou__ That sounds interesting , but I can ’ t drink alcohol with the medicine I ’ m taking . __eou__ Doesn ’ t sound like that ’ s be fun , then . Do you want to come here ? __eou__ I don ’ t have a car . __eou__ Goodness , we ’ re not having much luck here , are we ? __eou__ No . do you have a car ? __eou__ No , but I could take the bus . __eou__ Oh , good .

Did you feel frightened ? __eou__ For a short time . One of the engines caught fire . __eou__ What did the pilot do ? __eou__ He put it out and flew back to the airport . Then he asked the people at the airport where the emergency runway was . __eou__ Did you land safely ? __eou__ Yes , we did . But I shall never fly again . __eou__
I heard you are going out with John ? __eou__ Yes . To be frank , I really love him to death . __eou__ You are so lucky . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ Why ? Are you kidding me ?

We are merging with Trusten ? I never thought that would happen.Will we be getting new owners ? Will it affect our jobs ? __eou__ Probably.The new owners will be coming to start alignment meetings nextweek.One of the big question is what to call the new conglomerate company . __eou__ Wow , with such a big change.We won't have the same name ? __eou__ It's not only the name of our company that will change ... I expect that after this acquisition , there'll be a ton of things up in the air . __eou__

He won the battle of __eou__ I ’ m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey , where many historic figures are buried , like Isaac Newton , the great mathematician and Winston Churchill , the great wartime leader . __eou__ Nearby , on the banks of the thames , there ’ s the statue of Boadicea . She fought the Romans when they invaded Britain . __eou__ Women have often played an important role in british history . Queen Elizabeth I built a navy strong enough to fight off the Spanish armada in 1588 . more recently , Margaret thatcher transformed british __eou__ She was a very controversial leader . Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later ? __eou__ There ’ s a lot to see there . Perhaps we should go tomorrow . __eou__ I ’ m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . Many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . I really want to see the crown jewels too . __eou__ I ’ Ve seen them before . They ’ re quite incredible . If you want to see historical figures in London , there ’ s one place you have to go . __eou__ Where ’ s that ? Oh , I know !

Ted is so scared by dogs that he shakes in his shoes whenever he sees one . __eou__ The reason is that he once was bitten by a dog . __eou__ No wonder . __eou__
I think the government needs a radical plan to improve things . The government just talks , but in the long run , nothing is done to improve the economy . __eou__ That's right . They always talk about a need for new , progressive tactics , but they haven't done anything to stimulate new jobs . __eou__ Well , income taxes were decreased last year in hope to give the economy a boost , but I think it's backfired . The immediate effect of the tax reduction was to cause inflation to rise . __eou__ The worst part is that the inflation hurts the poor more than the rich . It also leads to more unemployment in the long run . I don't know what a good solution would be to make the economy more vibrant again ... __eou__ I have a good solution ... We need some new blood ! We should get rid of this president and boat in some new leaders ! __eou__
You have a nice apartment . __eou__ Thank you . My wife would be very happy to hear this . __eou__ She must have done a lot of work on it . __eou__ You bet . __eou__
I tried to ask the bank teller why it changed , but she didn't speak English well enough.So I decided to go to the magazine shop . The one around the corner.And I bought an American newspaper . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ It seems that yesterday the Mexican government declared wouldn't pay back the loans it got from the World Bank.The government declared a default on the loans . __eou__ That's serious . __eou__ I know . The economy here is having serious problems.But because the government declared a default , the currency value went way down . __eou__ So now Mexican pesos are worth about half as much . __eou__ Yes , it's an amazing drop . __eou__ Wow . I feel sorry for the Mexicans . But it's good for us . __eou__ Yes , it's very good . We suddenly have twice as much money to spend here.Our hotel is now half as expensive as when we got here ! Isn't that strange ? __eou__ Yes , and you know what ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ I don't really like this hotel that much.So tonight , now that we are so rich , tonight why don't we stay in the most expensive hotel in town ? __eou__ Why not ? We should do it . Because now we can afford it . __eou__
You are starting to learn English ? __eou__ Yeah . I like it , Dad . __eou__ You ’ re lucky you start to learn it so easily . I learned English very late , and learned it all by myself .

I spend all my time looking after my baby . I'm so tired . __eou__ Why don't you ask your husband to help you with it ? __eou__ I've tried it , but he would have none of it . __eou__
I ’ m itching for moving ! __eou__ What ’ s the matter ? What annoy you ? __eou__ It ’ s so wet and dark , I ’ m just fed up . __eou__
I understand your feeling . When someone is feeling at loose ends , we may show mercy on him . This is what we call the " milk of human kindness " . __eou__ That's right . But feeling sorry for someone is one thing , and sticking to our principles is another . We must make a clear cut between them . __eou__ You've take the words out of my mouth . __eou__
I ’ m so excited about Chinese New Year ! When do I get to visit Grandma ? Grandma makes the best dumplings in the world ! __eou__ Ha ha , right .

Hey , Dad , are you going to buy me firecrackers this year ? We ’ re going to have the best fireworks ! I ’ m really looking forward to lighting them ! __eou__ Son , firecrackers aren ’ t toys.they ’ re dangerous ! __eou__ No , fireworks are awesome ! __eou__ Whoa , don ’ t you remember ? Last year when I set off the firecrackers , you covered both your ears and hid behind your mother ? __eou__ I was scared because ... because I saw a bug . That ’ s all . __eou__ Ahahah ... really ? __eou__ Oh , and I can ’ t wait to watch the dragon dance ! Dad , can I sit on your shoulders this time ? __eou__ Hey , I offered last year ... __eou__ Well , I ... anyways , I was just thinking of the red envelopes . I wanna make a list of all the things I ’ m gonna buy with my red envelope money ! I can ’ t wait ! I ’ m gonna have so much money ! Mom , can I get a pen and a piece of paper ? I want a new transformer , no , two transformers ... the Optimums Prime , and ... maybe the wheeljack ? I ’ ll get a PSP game , ahahah , and I ’ ll buy the entire class lunch at MacDonald ’ s ... __eou__
Hi , Tom . You forgot to put on your sports shoes ! It's Games Day today ! __eou__ Well , I have them in my bag . I'Il put them on right away ! __eou__ Let me give you a hand . You are carrying so many books . __eou__ Thanks ! __eou__ Have you forgotten the cheers ? __eou__ No , I haven't . I've tried hard to remember and I'm quite sure I've memorized the rhythm correctly . __eou__ That's good ! __eou__
What a brilliant smile ! __eou__ That's my cousin Hubert . He likes smiling . __eou__ He must be very easy-going . __eou__ Sure , he's ready to be friendly with anyone . __eou__
My goodness.She is thirty seconds faster than the world records in five thousand meters race . __eou__ Excuse me.What did you say ? __eou__ A chinese girl have broken the world record in the Olympic Games __eou__ That's incredible . I cann't believe it . __eou__ You have to . It's sure . __eou__ How amazing ! __eou__
What's the matter ? You don't look well . __eou__ I am worried . __eou__ What about ? __eou__ My exam . __eou__ Oh , is that all ? __eou__ I feel very nervous about it . __eou__ Don't worry about it . Try to look on the bright sight of things . __eou__
What do you think of the way people use and treat animals ? __eou__ I think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . When we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor . __eou__ Perhaps people should stop eating animals . We could grow more crops . __eou__ What would you do with all the animals ? You couldn ’ t just let them go . Besides , some people would still hunt them . Meat has become an integral part of our diet . __eou__ We could provide them with better conditions anyway . We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible . __eou__ That ’ s true . I think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . I think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals . __eou__ I agree . I ’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo . I don ’ t like animals experiments though . I believe that we can do tests in other ways . __eou__ I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced . __eou__ That ’ s good news . The good thing is that most people treat their pets well . __eou__ Sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare . __eou__ Have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals . __eou__ Yes , I have . They do an excellent job . __eou__
It's said you will go abroad to pursue your graduate studies . __eou__ Yes , I've been thinking about visiting you . I hope to get some advice from you . __eou__ Which country do you want to go to ? __eou__ My field is electronic engineering . Which country do you think I should go ? __eou__ Were I in your position , I ’ d go to America . __eou__ Which university should I apply to ? __eou__ There are many universities for you to choose from . Some famous universities such as Harvard , Yale , the University of Michigan , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are really wonderful places to study , but they are very competitive and expensive . Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper . __eou__ Oh , I see . Thank you very much . __eou__
How's it going ? __eou__ Great ! __eou__
So how long have you know Jack ? __eou__ We go way back.We ' Ve known each other since we were toddlers . __eou__ Really ? You guys must be really tight . __eou__ Yeah , We're buddy-buddy still . __eou__ He seems sincere , and trustworthy . __eou__ Well , he is , but he can be conniving at times . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I know that he would never stab me in the back.But I've seen him double cross other people . __eou__ Oh , my ! Really ? I never thought he would be like that . __eou__ Don't get me wrong , I'm not saying he's like that all the time . __eou__ So , can I trust him or what ? __eou__ Well , I think you should decide for yourself . __eou__ But I need someone that I can count on for this job . __eou__ Okay , Okay.You can trust him . I was just trying to give you a hard time . __eou__ Come on you're confusing me.Give it to me straight . __eou__ Actually , he's the most dependable person I know , and he would never turn on anyone . __eou__
Are you free this Saturday evening ? __eou__ Oh , it seems there is nothing that evening . __eou__ Would you like to go to the concert with me ? __eou__ I'd like to , where ? __eou__ At our club . __eou__ When ? __eou__ At 7:30 p . m . __eou__ I'll go in time , thank you . __eou__ I'm so pleased that you can go . __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I'd like to borrow these books . __eou__ Just a second . I'll see if I can find them for you . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ Here you are . You must return them within a month . __eou__ What happens if I'm not finished with them in a month ? __eou__ You can come in and renew them unless someone else has reserved them . __eou__ OK . Thank you very much for your trouble . __eou__ No trouble at all . So long . __eou__
You look tired . __eou__ Yeah , I've been working so much overtime lately . __eou__ Really ? How come ? __eou__ My boss gave me a big project . I had to have it finished by this morning . It was so difficult . __eou__ You shouldn't work so hard . __eou__ I know , but hard work pays off . You know . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Maybe now I'll get that promotion I was hoping for . __eou__
How do you like Korea ? __eou__ I like it . It's a beautiful country . __eou__ What part of the visit excited you most ? __eou__ The best island of Korea-Jizhou island . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Attractive scenery , pleasant climate , these make it charming . __eou__ Yes , I think so . But there is also something terrible . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Sometimes the traffic is too busy . __eou__ Yes , you are right . __eou__
How should I dress for the party ? __eou__ Dress casually . __eou__
I love her so much , you know . I want to be alone . Please keep quiet . __eou__ I am just casting pearls before swine . __eou__
Are you saying you saw an eagle ? There are no eagles here . __eou__ Yes , I saw one . Believe me . __eou__ You must have seen some other kind of bird . __eou__
I haven't met the Smiths for a long time . __eou__ They have moved to Chicago . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Mr.Smith has changed his job . __eou__
Did you go camping last Saturday ? __eou__ We went to the coast . It's really a nice place for camping , really good time around the fire singing and dancing . __eou__ How many members were in your party in all ? __eou__ There were six of us . __eou__ Did you get caught in the bad storm ? __eou__ Yes , we got wet through . But we still enjoyed ourselves . __eou__
Thanks for the advice , Mr . Macmillan . I'll keep it in mind . I had better head off though . I ’ m meeting my husband for dinner . __eou__ Sure , I'm heading out myself . Enjoy your evening . __eou__ Thanks , sir . You too . Drive safely , I hear there ’ s a lot ice on the roads . __eou__ Thanks for the warning ! See you tomorrow ! __eou__
Tomorrow I'll take you to some places that I'm sure you will have interest in . __eou__ Where else haven't we been to yet ? __eou__ They are the Folk Antique Handicrafts and Collectibles Exhibition Halls . __eou__ Sounds great ! How many kinds of folk collections do they have ? __eou__ Well . there're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city . That's half the collections of antique objects in China . There's one exhibition half for multiple collection , and several individual display rooms for private collectors . __eou__ Private collectors ! They must have excellent collections . I'II go and see each of them . What kinds of collections can I see ? Come on , don't keep me in suspense ! __eou__ No hurry ! I'II tell you now , The collections include ancient cases and caskets , tea sets , abacuses , precious sea shells and conches , drama costumes , agates , ancient coins , fans , mini-musical instruments , root-carving , rare stones and rocks , model ships , model cars ... __eou__ Enough ! I can't wait anymore . __eou__
The show will be starting in a few minutes . We'd better go in and find our seats . __eou__ Number 7 and 9 of the Row 11 in the stalls , aren't they ? __eou__ That's right . This entrance is for even numbers . That entrance over there is for odd numbers . Let's go over there . __eou__ What a nice theatre ! I guess it can seat hundreds of people . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__ Look . It's begin . __eou__ Well , how did you like the show ? __eou__ It's so interesting , I like it very much . __eou__
Now , you are to board the plane.We ' re sorry that we haven't done much to help you when you stayed in China . __eou__ I appreciate what you have done for me.Everything I have seen here has left a deep impression on me . I really don't know how to express my thanks to you . __eou__ We are ready to help you . __eou__ Will you be kind to say " Thank you " to Mr.Zhang and other friends for me ? __eou__ I'd like to . I'm sure your visit will help to promote the friendship and understanding between both of us.Welcome to China again . __eou__ Of course , I will.Well , it's time for me to say goodbye.The plane will take off soon.Hope some day you will come to America for a visit . __eou__ Thank you . I will if I have chance.Goodbye and happy landing ! __eou__ Goodbye ! __eou__
Is the lake very polluted ? __eou__ Well , I wouldn't swim in it - but the water is much cleaner than it was a few years ago . __eou__ Are local factories allowed to discharge waste water into the lake ? __eou__ Yes , but it must be treated in an effluent treatment plant first . __eou__
Isn ’ t this great ? I always wanted to own a farm , live out in the country , grow my own food ! __eou__ This is very beautiful . Though I have to confess , I don ’ t know the first thing about farming ! __eou__ That ’ s fine ! Don ’ t worry about it ! __eou__ What was that ? __eou__ Relax , it was just a goat ! __eou__ And that ? __eou__ It ’ s just the cows that are grazing over there . We can milk them later . __eou__ What was that ? __eou__ Honey , seriously , It ’ s just a sheep . Relax ! Relax , that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable . __eou__ You know what ? I don ’ t think I can hack it here out in the countryside . I ’ m going back to the city ! __eou__
Well , thank you.Mr.Parry , for all your information.Just one more question . __eou__ Yes , sir ? __eou__ Do you play any sports or games ? __eou__ I used to play football regularly when I was at university.And I used to do athletics in the summer . __eou__ And what athletics did you play ? Can you remember ? __eou__ I was a runner_a long-distance runner . __eou__ And now ? __eou__ No . I'm afraid I haven't had time since I got married . __eou__ Well , thank you again for coming to see us.But just remember that we like people who join the company to play in the company sports teams . __eou__ Certainly , sir . __eou__
Hey , that's a really nice outfit you have on . __eou__ Thank you . I wasn't sure if it looked okay or not . __eou__ Oh , you look stunning . Your dress really goes well with your shoes . __eou__ I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing . __eou__ No , not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ? __eou__ I got it on sale down at the department store . __eou__ When did you go there ? __eou__ I was just there a couple of days ago . You know , you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale . __eou__ I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ? __eou__ Anything you want . They have both casual and formal styles . __eou__ I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection . __eou__ That's a good idea . __eou__
The poor girl is up to the eyes in study all the day . __eou__ Yeah , she has a lot of homework . __eou__ Today's children have not the chance to play , to make fun of them . __eou__ Right . So in some way we are happier . __eou__ Yeah , at least when we are children , we have not so much homework to do . __eou__
Could you just hold this for me ? __eou__ What are you doing ? Is anything wrong ? __eou__ Yes , but I've nearly fixed it . Just take it , will you ? __eou__ Oh , yes , of course . I'm sorry-I wasn't thinking ... __eou__
Sometimes I think television is too biased . None of them are completely objective . __eou__ That's unavoidable , but think , How would you keep up to date without television ? __eou__ Newspapers or the radio I guess . I just wish TV was more objective . __eou__ Look , you can still learn a lot from watching television , you just need to be smart when you're watching . Filter the information and decide if you believe what you are hearing or not . __eou__ The internet's a lot worse . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ There's no one moderating it . Anyone around the world can put information onto the net for anyone else to see . The information on the internet is mostly unsubstantiated and you can never know who has written it , or why . A lot of people get conned online . __eou__ Again , you need to think carefully . If you don't trust others online , have nothing to do with them . __eou__
I went to the doctor yesterday . __eou__ I beg your pardon ? __eou__ I said I had been to the doctor the day before . __eou__ What did he say ? __eou__ He said I ' d got the flu . __eou__ Oh dear ! What did he tell you to do ? __eou__ He told me to stay in bed for ten days . __eou__ Ten days ? Would you please repeat it again ? __eou__ Yes , ten days . __eou__
How nice it is here . __eou__ You can say that again.The sun is shining and there is a pleasant breeze.It ' s so lovely . __eou__ I've heard the weather here is ideal , just like spring most of the year . __eou__ That's correct . We have four seasons of spring . __eou__
What did you think of the teambuiding session this morning ? Do you think it did much good ? __eou__ Well , a lot of the games were pretty silly . I don't know how much it helped us to be a better team , but i think everyone had a good time . __eou__ I think that's an important part of it all ... we've got to be able to see another side of our co-workers and boss ... We can see what they're like as real human beings , working together on some project , for fun . I really think it helped our team jell together better . __eou__ Yeah , I guess you're right . I think the trust game was my favorite . I think in order to have a strong team , we've all got to learn how to trust each other more . __eou__ The trust game was your favorite , huh ? My favorite part was the personality tests . I think to know more about what kind of personality type you are will tell you a lot about how you can fit into a team.Also , when you know the personality strengths of your colleagues , it helps you understand them better . __eou__
Beautiful weather , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Yes , it is . Are you here on business ? __eou__ No , I ’ m on a vacation to see the famous Three Gorges . __eou__ I ’ m going there for a tour , too . Is this your first trip to China ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ Why don ’ t we go together ? I can show you around . I think you ’ ll have a better time . __eou__ I couldn ’ t agree more . __eou__ Great , let ’ s go ! __eou__
Tiffany , why are more and more people turning to the Web to find a mate ? __eou__ I think that , as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure , it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people , and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced . __eou__ There are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group . But how should you screen potential mates ? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail ? __eou__ I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long . A lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy . Quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world . __eou__ Can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the Net ? __eou__ I'd suggest you not give out too much personal information , like your home address , until after several dates . Just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger . __eou__ Besides the growth of these matchmaker sites , do you have any stats on success rates ? Are people out there finding true and lasting love through the Internet __eou__ Well , for a site like ecrush.com , since their debut in Valentine's Day in 1999 , of the 1.5 million people who have joined ecrush.com , 300000 have actually matched . __eou__ Do you have any successful stories to share ? __eou__ Yes , the couple that I highlighted at today's show met on Match.com and they're getting married this summer . __eou__
Isabelle , you know I'm not interested in fame . __eou__ Well , you don't seem to be interested in getting a real job , either . __eou__ You know I'm interested in teaching . I'm looking for jazz students ... __eou__ Yeah , and every high school student in town is banging on your door , right ? __eou__ I know they're out there . I'll find them . __eou__ You're such a dreamer ! You think that you can spread the word of jazz in an underpass ? __eou__
I think your speech was excellent . __eou__ Was it ? __eou__ Sure it was . __eou__ Thank you.It was really a challenge to speak before such a large audience , you know . __eou__ But you did it and did it well ! __eou__
Smith is always careless , it is his Achilles ’ s heel . __eou__ He would get very angry if anyone criticized him . __eou__ He will burn his fingers . __eou__ If only he knew it . __eou__
Here's some dancing . See those guys stomping , clapping and shouting ? They're practicing step-dancing . __eou__ It sounds cool . The rhythms look really difficult . __eou__ They basically turn their bodies into drums . There's a national step competition every year . __eou__ Well , black people are supposed to be great dancers . __eou__ Wen ! That's only a stereotype . Like all Asians are supposed to be math geniuses . I'm not a great dancer , and you said you failed calculus . __eou__ Ha-ha ! You got me there ! __eou__
This is the end , Jane . I don't want a girlfriend who goes out with other guys all the time . __eou__ I won't do it again . Please forgive me . __eou__ No way . I've given you too many chances already . __eou__
What's the bonus like at your company ? __eou__ Well , it's OK , I suppose . We get about the equivalent of six months ' salary . __eou__ Six months ' salary ? Are you serious ? That's incredible ! __eou__ Maybe . But you'd be amazed at how little's left after the credit companies have deducted their share from my account . __eou__ Hey , I know what that's like . I bought a BMW on my Visa card . Now the payments really hurt . __eou__ Well , you're lucky that you're still able to make your payments . I missed a credit payment last month . Now my bank account's overdrawn , and the company is threatening to take back my purchases . __eou__ What did you buy ? __eou__ A new home health monitor . __eou__ Health Monitor ? I read an article about that racket.They ' re overpriced to begin with ! Listen , if I were you , I'd let them take back their monitor and spend my money on something more practical . __eou__ You're kidding ! __eou__ No joke ! __eou__ That's something else ! Maybe I'll return it to them . __eou__
OK , Ann , you spent quite a bit of time in Australia recently so why don't you talk about that ? __eou__ I really liked living in Australia . I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney . And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney . There are lots of great clubs . And people were very , very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney . __eou__ Mm-hm . How long were you there ? __eou__ I was there for almost a year . __eou__ Oh , OK . __eou__ And I travelled a little bit in Australia . I went up the east coast . Up to Frasier Island . Which is a world heritage site . And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the ... , which is a but north . And the further north you go in Australia , the hotter it gets . So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license , so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly . __eou__ So , did you , did you lose your finger ? __eou__ Almost . __eou__ Almost . Ah , you're lucky . Um , it's funny , you go in the water and you worry about sharks , but not clams . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__ Will you be going back to Australia soon ? __eou__ I'd like to go and live there for at least another year . Probably I'll go back to Sydney or maybe I'll go down to Melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city . They have lot of museums and parks . __eou__
Tom did me many favors . __eou__ For example ? __eou__
I have just had my new paper published . __eou__ You have done excellent work . __eou__ I'm going to Britain . __eou__ Really ? How did you get the chance ? __eou__ I have been accepted by Oxford University on PhD . __eou__ My warmest congratulations on your entering the Oxford University . __eou__ I really appreciate your kind words . __eou__
Happy birthday ! This is for you , Kate . __eou__ Thanks , Miss . Wang . __eou__ You know in China we usually don't open presents until the guests leave . __eou__ Really ? I've already opened it . Great ! And it is exactly after my fancy . Thank you very much . __eou__
Guess who I saw yesterday ? __eou__ I don't know . Who ? __eou__ Avril Lavigen ! __eou__ The Canadian rock singer ? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday . How did you see her ? __eou__ Yeah , I worked as temporary staff in her concert . Look , her poster , a CD ... __eou__ So you're a big fan , eh ? __eou__ Not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion designer , too . __eou__ And she was in a movie once again , right ? __eou__ Yeah , though I don't think her acting skills are that great . __eou__ What was your impression of her when you saw her in person ? __eou__ She looked sweeter than her pictures . __eou__ Did you take a photo with her ? __eou__ No , there were too many people . When she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and to get her autographs . __eou__ Crazy ! __eou__
I have to go home now , Jenny . Thanks for inviting me to your party . __eou__ I'm glad you came . I hope you enjoyed it . __eou__ I had a wonderful time . __eou__
I was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades . __eou__ Grades are based on many things __eou__ What counts the most ? __eou__ Actually I look at all of it and let's not forget class participation . __eou__ Do you grade on a curve or use percentages ? __eou__ Homework , attendance , and quizzes are sixty percent ; the mid-term and final are worth twenty percent each . __eou__ What if we miss something ? __eou__ I will allow one unexcused absence ; after that you need to contact me ahead of time . __eou__ Will you tell us if we are failing during the year ? __eou__ You will be able to track your progress during the year . __eou__
Okay , show me your card hand . Here's mine . I have three Kings and a pair of Aces . __eou__ How did you get that ? No need to show you my hand , I lose.This is not as much fun as the music concert we just saw . __eou__ Thanks again for buying the tickets . That was the most exciting live concert I've ever seen . That silver electric guitar was really cool . __eou__ They're quite popular now . Wasn't her voice good ? __eou__ That , My Heart Will Go On . It warms my heart . you know , JanetJackson , Shanna Twain and Celine Dion are so very different . __eou__ Janet Jackson is more pop music.Shania sings country music . Celine just seems to hit all the right notes . __eou__ Have you heard Maria Carey ? __eou__ Yes , l have two of her Cds , l'II lend them to you if you like . __eou__ Excellent . You can borrow my Janet Jackson's CD . It's her new one . __eou__ I hope you have a good stereo . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because you have to hear it really loud to get the full concert effect . __eou__
Sarah . You look terrible . What's wrong ? __eou__ My grandmother just passed away . __eou__ I'm so sorry to hear that . When did this happen ? __eou__ A couple of days ago . I just go back from the funeral . __eou__ Is there anything I can do ? __eou__ No ... not really . The sad thing is that I wasn't there when she died . I really wanted to be there one last time . __eou__ I'm sure she knew you loved her . Did she pass away in the hospital ? __eou__ Yeah . She died in her sleep . __eou__ I'm sorry she's gone . __eou__ At least she didn't suffer . __eou__ I think your grandmother would want you to think of all the good times you spent together . __eou__ I know . But I miss her . __eou__ When my grandmother passed away , I frequently visited her in the cemetery . I always talked to her . Even though she wasn't there , I somehow knew she heard what I said . __eou__ Yeah ? That's what I was thinking too . Thanks . __eou__ It looks like you haven't eaten anything all day . We should get you something to eat . __eou__ You're right ... I should eat something . Let's go . __eou__
It will do you good to go out for entertainment at weekends.What kind of movie do you like best ? __eou__ It's hard to say , I like interesting and significant ones . I don't care whether they're blockbusters or not . __eou__ Shall we go downtown for a movie this Friday evening ? __eou__ Very good , What's on ? __eou__ I'm not sure . Let me give a call to find out . __eou__
Let's go eat . __eou__ 0kay . Dinner's on me . __eou__
I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try and I have been here for 2 years already ! __eou__ Well , have you thought of getting an MBA ? I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top . __eou__ An MBA , hey . . . well my degree wasn't in business , the business schools won't be interested in me . __eou__ Nonsense ! The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT . __eou__ GMAT ? What does that stand for and what will the test contain ? __eou__ Graduate Management Admission Test , it contains three parts __eou__ Okay , this sounds a little tough , how am I supposed to practice for this ? __eou__ Up to you , you could have a one on one session with a tutor or group sessions , you can also use free or private computer software . Going to church might help as well ! __eou__ No matter what I do , I'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat ! __eou__ Umm . . . That's the spirit ! __eou__
hello , Kate ! How are you doing ? __eou__ fine , thanks . How are you ? __eou__ fine . How are your term papers ? __eou__ oh , my lord . I haven't really started them . __eou__ how could it be ? They are due two weeks later . __eou__ I know but I was busy with my part-time job the last few days . __eou__ Kate , you know , I am thinking of getting a part-time job next year because I really need more money and I don't want to ask my parents for any more . But I'm so busy ! How am I going to work and study __eou__ to be honest with you , Jason , I don't think I'm doing a very good job of balancing my schoolwork with my job . I'm always two steps behind . I've got to get back to the dorm and continue writing tha __eou__ my advisor ? __eou__
This is the good life ! We have it good don ’ t you think ? __eou__ Yeah of course ! Although , don ’ t you ever wonder what could have been ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ Like for example , if I hadn ’ t studied architecture , I would have become an artist like I wanted to . __eou__ I see . Yeah now that I think of it , I wouldn ’ t have gotten married if I hadn ’ t moved to this town and met Sally . __eou__ You see ! Everything happens for a reason ! We wouldn ’ t even have met if I hadn ’ t been in that car accident ten years ago ! __eou__ Well , I have no regrets ! __eou__ I ’ ll drink to that ! __eou__
Would you like to go to the movies tonight ? __eou__ Well , I just saw a horror movie last night . It almost frightened me to death . __eou__ Well , we could see something different like a detective film . __eou__ I don't care for a detective film . It also makes me nervous . __eou__ How about a comedy ? __eou__ No , I don't think comedies today are natural or cheerful . __eou__ How about a love story then ? __eou__ No , romance is boring . __eou__ What's you opinion ? __eou__ Let's go to see a war movie , shall we ? __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Certainly . Is there anything wrong ? __eou__ No , but I can't imagine that a girl like you would wonder to see a war movie . __eou__
Hi . Bob ! We've been working hard at our lessons for a fortnight . So why don't we take it easy this weekend ? __eou__ Okay ! What do you suggest ? __eou__ How about seeing a play ? I hear Hamlet is on at the National Theater . __eou__ Is that so ? Why not ? __eou__ ( looking at a newspaper ) Oh , dear me ! There's no performance at the National theater this weekend . So we have to go to cinema instead . __eou__ What's on ? __eou__ Let me see .. um . Gone With the Wind . It is on at six cinemas on Saturday night . __eou__ That sounds interesting . Which is the nearest ? __eou__ Ah . The Royal , I think . __eou__ What time does it start ? __eou__ Why don't we go to the 7:30 show ? It is convenient to us , I think . __eou__ But we won't have enough time for dinner . __eou__ Do you want to go to the earlier or the later show ? __eou__ Ah ... I fancy going to the later show . __eou__ Then , there's a 9:30 show . __eou__ That's Okay , I think . __eou__ All right . __eou__
Her ex-boyfriend was terrible , but this new one is even worse ! __eou__ Out of the frying pan and into the fire . __eou__
The man behind your mother must be your elder brother . __eou__ Yes , he was 29 then . __eou__ He looked his age . __eou__
Well , I've got to go . See you later . __eou__ See you . Have a nice day ! __eou__ Thanks , you too . __eou__
What did you say ? __eou__ Are you deaf or what ? __eou__
Who's your favorite singer ? __eou__ Coco Lee . __eou__
Hey , Ann . You don't have a pen , do you ? __eou__ Sure , here you go . __eou__ Thanks . I don't suppose you have some paper , too . __eou__ Of course . There you are . __eou__ Thanks so much . I owe you one . __eou__
Are you ready , honey ? __eou__ Sorry , not yet ! can you help me to select the dress ? i don , t what i should wear to fit thinner party . __eou__ Just dress formal . __eou__ How about transom ? __eou__ It is too loud , we ’ ll handle some official business first before the dinner . __eou__ Oh , i nearly forget it . __eou__ You can put on your white shoes , it fits every occasion . __eou__
What's the matter with you , then ? You look miserable . __eou__ It's us . __eou__ What do you mean by us ? __eou__ Well , we used to talk to each other before we were married.Remember ? __eou__ What do you mean ? We're talking now , aren't we ? __eou__ Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together . __eou__ Yes . I remember.But we never used to argue.You used to think I was wonderful.Where are you going ? __eou__ Back to live with my parents.That ' s something else I used to do before we were married.Remember ? __eou__
I think it is time to study . Our chemistry exam is coming . __eou__ Oh , I know . When is it ? __eou__ December 1st . __eou__ What's on the test ? __eou__ It seems to be from chapter six to chapter ten . __eou__ Well . I think I'm going to fail my chemistry exam . __eou__ Why are you so pessimistic ? __eou__ I'm not being pessimistic . I'm being realistic . My chemistry is so bad . __eou__ I believe you can pass the exam with good preparation . Don't lose your heart . __eou__ Thank you . That's very nice of you . __eou__
Are you new here ? __eou__ Yes , I am . __eou__ Is this your first year in college ? __eou__ I actually transferred here from another school . __eou__ Which school ? __eou__ I transferred from PCC . __eou__ How do you like it here compared to PCC ? __eou__ I love it here . __eou__ Do you like it better here or at PCC ? __eou__ Don ’ t get me wrong . I like it here , but PCC is better . __eou__ So , why did you leave PCC ? __eou__ Because I got my AA and now I am going towards my bachelor degree . __eou__
I don't know what I can do now . I'm down and out . __eou__ You are not the gray train , I guess . But bite the bullet and you'll soon be in the chips again . __eou__ I hope so . But I'm always caught short . __eou__ But the darkest hour is the nearest dawn . I bet you'll soon turn the table . __eou__
I was just about to go to bed when the telephone rang last night . __eou__ Who was it ? __eou__ Kate . She said she was too excited to go to sleep . __eou__ She never cares about others . __eou__ It ’ s true . Guess what we were talking about last night . __eou__ Her new boyfriend , right ? __eou__ Yeah , how do you know about that ? __eou__ I was also interrupted by her last week because of such a thing . __eou__
if you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese ? __eou__ why ? Did tom pop the question ? __eou__ not yet . But I wonder if I can get my parents ’ consent . __eou__ let me guess , your parents want you to marry a Chinese man , right ? __eou__ you are right . It is giving me a real headache . I feel like I ’ m between a rock and a hard place . __eou__ I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex . __eou__ oh , how did you deal with it ? __eou__ I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend . But finally we broke up . __eou__ oh , it ’ s a pity . What was the matter ? __eou__ simple . We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences . __eou__ like what ? __eou__ he hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family . __eou__ Oh , I see . In their culture women should put family first . __eou__ yes , he said it would be batter for me and for the whole family . But I simply can not quit working . __eou__ so that's why it ’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner . __eou__ not really . There are many successful mixed marriage around us . __eou__
I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ? __eou__ You look a bit pale , don't you ? __eou__ Yes , I can't sleep well every night . __eou__ You should get plenty of sleep . __eou__ I drink a lot of wine . __eou__ If I were you , I wouldn't drink too much . __eou__ I often feel so tired . __eou__ You better do some exercise every morning . __eou__ I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me . __eou__ Why do you worry about your future ? You're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . I hope you take my advice . __eou__
Hi Joe . You met my new assistant , right ? __eou__ Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up . __eou__ You are kidding , but she's so helpful . __eou__ Tom ... you are her boss , you kown.Of course , she's helpful to you . __eou__ Come on . She's like that with everyone . __eou__ I don't think so actually . She never even says " hello " to me . __eou__
Hey , you , pick up that piece of garbage ! __eou__ Huh ? Me ? __eou__ Yeah , you . I just saw you throw a piece of garbage on the ground . Can't you read the No Littering sign ? It's a $ 500 penalty for littering , so go pick it up and put it in the garbage can over there . __eou__ Why should I do that ? It's only a piece of garbage . Why should you care ? __eou__ Because this is a public place , and I want to spend my time here without having to look at your garbage . __eou__ Listen , I really don't know why you're making this into such a big issue . It's only a small piece of garbage in a large space . It's not like there's garbage everywhere . Besides , someone will come along to clean it up at some time or another . __eou__ It's not the cleaner's responsibility to pick up after lazy people . It's part of your responsibility to make sure that the place is neat for other people . If everyone thought like you , there'd be garbage everywhere ! The cleaners can't be everywhere ! __eou__ Ok , whatever . See , I'm putting it in the garbage can . __eou__ Hold on , that's an item . You should put that in the recycle bin next to the trashcan . __eou__
What are you doing this weekend ? __eou__ I don't have any plans . __eou__
If ever you ’ re in Chicago , please do look me up . __eou__ Well , yes , I ’ d like to , if it ’ s not too much trouble . __eou__ No trouble at all . I think maybe you will meet some of my friends here as well . __eou__ That ’ d be fine . __eou__
How do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ? __eou__ I've never really thought about it before . I guess it doesn't bother me . __eou__ Do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ? __eou__ I guess so . I usually buy name-brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . How about you ? __eou__ I actually try to avoid name-brand items . I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place ! __eou__ I know that advertisers are experts at persuading people to spend their money , I think brilliant items are usually higher quality than ~ grounds . __eou__ I think is sensible to buy products that is high quality than others when you want to buy something that's going to last a long time , but I don't think it always makes sense . __eou__ Do you have a brand preference for anything ? __eou__ I do for shower items like shower gel and shampoo , but I don't for higher-end items . __eou__ What do you think about the " impossible is nothing " billboard on the high street ? __eou__ It's just a slogan for a famous company ; there's nothing really special about it . __eou__ I think it's a brilliant advert ! It really grabs my attention ! __eou__ To each their own ! __eou__
Did you see the fashion awards last night ? __eou__ I sat through about half of it but they lost me after that . __eou__ Not interested ? __eou__ Not really , to be honest . Some of what they call fashion looks terrible to me . __eou__ But they are showing what will be all the rage next year . __eou__ All the rage with whom ? I never see anyone wearing these designs on the street . __eou__ Did you know that fashion is cyclical ? __eou__ What , it keeps coming back ? __eou__ Precisely ! For example , Flares were popular for a while , then went out of fashion . Now we can start to see them coming back in again . __eou__ Flares ? __eou__ They're also known as bell-bottoms . They are a type of trousers . __eou__ It's too complicated . I'll just stick to the plain clothes . __eou__ That's fine , but then you'll always look plain . __eou__
Our national economy is increasing hand over fist . __eou__ That ’ s really a good phenomenon to see . __eou__ I hope it ’ ll continue for a long time . __eou__
Betty was in hospital . __eou__ I know that . I met her last week , and she looked as pale as death . __eou__ She suffers from cancer . __eou__ That ’ s too bad . She ’ s been so kind to us all . __eou__
Do you have any plan on your mind ? __eou__ I want to see all places of renown in Suzhou . __eou__ How are we going there , by bike or by bus ? __eou__ By bike , of course.You don't want to miss the beautiful scenery , do you ? __eou__
Maybe we all will be all things to all men . __eou__ How terrible ! __eou__ But for the life , we'll be changed by this society . __eou__ I really don't want to go into the world , I feel afraid of it . __eou__ Don't be silly . We have reached the age to take the responsibility by ourselves . __eou__ I know . __eou__
You're late . __eou__ I know I'm late . I'm sorry . I tried to call you to tell you , but your phone seems to be disconnected . __eou__ My phone ? __eou__ Yes . An automatic message says your phone is not in service . __eou__ Really ? I had no idea . Let me check.Yes , it's dead . There's no dial tone . __eou__ So I couldn't get through . I knew I'd be late because my car wouldn't start.It was too cold I had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . That's why I'm late . __eou__ But this is terrible . I'm expecting important calls . __eou__ About what ? __eou__ You know what.The theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play.They are supposed to call me this evening.If I don't have a phone . Oh , what can I do ? __eou__ Well , the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast . __eou__ Do you have a cell phone ? __eou__ No . I hate cell phones.But you could go to a neighbor's house and use their phone . __eou__ Can you drive me ? I will go to Ann's house . It isn't far . I can call the theater guild from there and give them her number.She will let us wait in her living room . __eou__ Yes , of course I can drive you.So you don't want to get your phone fixed right away ? __eou__ Yes , I do.At Ann's house I will call the phone company and have them check my line.If they can fix it right away without coming to my house , then we'll just return here.But if not , I need to wait at Ann's house to talk with the theater guild.It ' s very important to me . __eou__ Alright , let's go . __eou__ Yes , let's go . __eou__
Would you like to go to a concert tonight ? __eou__ I'd like to very much . __eou__ All right , then.There is one at the new concert hall . __eou__ Who's playing ? __eou__ It's the Powell orchestra . __eou__ Do you know what they are playing ? __eou__ They're doing a seventeenth-century program . __eou__ And who is directing ? __eou__ Well , I'm not sure of his name , but I know it's going to be his farewell performance . __eou__
I am unsure how to add a class and need help . __eou__ I have an opening . Do you have an add sheet for me to sign ? __eou__ Yes , I have an add sheet . __eou__ After I sign it , you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class . Do you know where that is ? __eou__ No , I'm not sure . __eou__ When you cross the quad , the office is right in front of you . Go inside and follow the signs to the correct line . __eou__ Thanks . I understand what to do now . __eou__ It should be easy to find . After you add the class , check with me in a few weeks to make sure that you are on my roll sheet . __eou__ That sounds good . __eou__ Good , just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class . Good luck ! __eou__
I found out when Jim's birthday is . It's this Friday . __eou__ Let's plan a surprise party for him ! __eou__ Can you spread the word and ask everyone to bring some kind of snack food ? __eou__ That's easy . Anything else ? __eou__ Will you call his wife and let her know so that if she is available , she can come too ? __eou__ Won't he be surprised ! __eou__ I don't know how old he is though . __eou__ That's O . K . Maybe his wife will spill the beans ! __eou__
In spring , people are feeling refreshed . They take off their heavy winter clothes and walk with a straight back and light steps . They feel they are full of spirits and energy . __eou__ Women in particular . They are anxious to get rid of those thick and clumsy winter suits and put on their new fashionable spring dress . __eou__ Well , when summer comes , the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen ; the sun is blazing and the air is threatening . No one would like to stay in the open air for long . __eou__ That's true . In summer , the first place people want to go is a spacious room with air-conditioning or a quiet river or swimming pool . __eou__ I myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects , especially the singing of cicadas . __eou__ In autumn , almost all fruits are ripe and all crops are waiting to be harvested . __eou__ And you can hear singing and laughing everywhere ! People are happy in autumn because autumn brings them harvest and richness and prosperity ! __eou__ Well , winter is a season for relaxation , do you agree with me ? __eou__ Well , it's hard to say . For the fields and rivers , winter is a relaxing season , but for farmers , I think they might take a rest physically , but mentally they are still busy thinking , planning and calculating for the working of the next year . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__
Hey Sarah , are you all right ? You look upset . __eou__ As a matter of fact , I am a bit upset . I just came out of a meeting and it didn't go very well . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ No one would listen to any of my suggestions . Instead , they just kept arguing with each other . __eou__ Who was chairing the meeting ? __eou__ Bob . __eou__ Well , I can tell you from experience that Bob might come off a little strong sometimes . __eou__ That's exactly what happened ! He kept interrupting everyone with his own suggestions and did not want to hear what others had to say . Then he expected everyone to agree with him . __eou__ What was the meeting about ? __eou__ We were trying to come up with ideas to streamline the office's workflow to make it more efficient . __eou__ It's ironic that the meeting was anything but efficient . __eou__ Exactly . I had tons of ideas that I wanted to share , but they just wouldn't let me finish . What should I have done to get my point across ? __eou__ You have to keep things short and sweet . When you get a chance to speak , try not to get into too many unnecessary details . __eou__ Short and sweet ? But what if I have to explain something complicated ? __eou__ You can always bring up the main points during the meeting and speak to those who are directly involved after the meeting . Not everyone needs to know all that information . __eou__ That's a good idea , I think I will try that at the next meeting . __eou__
Let's go to the cinema tonight , shall we ? __eou__ Good idea . Is there a good movie on ? __eou__ What about ' Farewell My Concubine ' ? I've been wanting to see it for a long time . __eou__ All right . But it'll be difficult to buy tickets I suppose . __eou__ My brother has offered me two tickets for this evening . __eou__ What time does it begin ? __eou__ At eight thirty . __eou__ I'll come for you at about eight . __eou__ OK , I'll be waiting . __eou__
I ’ d love to have my own farm . __eou__ It would be very hard work . Are you sure ? __eou__ I wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy . __eou__ Running a farm would be totally different to you current job . __eou__ That ’ s one reason I ’ d like to try it . I ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office . __eou__ You ’ d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer . It ’ s not something you can just walk into . __eou__ My uncle owns a farm and I ’ Ve spent some time working with him . I love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields . __eou__ Well , I ‘ d certainly come and visit you . It would be great to take a working holiday on a farm . I ’ d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while . __eou__
Good afternoon , everyone . The experiment is to start at 3 . Have you gone through the instructions ? __eou__ Yes , sir . __eou__ Ok , now some points for attention . First of all , pay attention to safety ... Now , sign your names on the lab record , and after that you can start . If there is any question , just let me know . __eou__ Excuse me , sir . This air compressor doesn't work . __eou__ Have you turned it on ? __eou__ Yes , I have . __eou__ Ok , I will get you another one . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Guess what ? Paul and Susan are engaged . __eou__ Really ? When did that happen ? __eou__ A week ago ? They met last summer and now just sink . They will be married soon . __eou__ Have they set a date for the wedding ? __eou__ No , not yet . But Susan says they ’ d like to get married in November or December . Then they ’ ll go to Hawaii for their honeymoon . __eou__
Oh man ! I ’ Ve been starving myself for days now and I haven ’ t lost an ounce ! __eou__ Are you trying to lose weight ? __eou__ Yeah , my friend is getting married next month and I ’ m supposed to be a bridesmaid . I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding , but I haven ’ t lost any weight ! Look at these love handles . __eou__ You don ’ t have to starve yourself to lose weight . I think that ’ s where you ’ re going wrong . __eou__ Why ? If I eat less , then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves , right ? __eou__ Not really . You should try to not eat foods high in calories , salts or saturated fats . Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors . __eou__ So you are saying that I should eat , but I should just watch what I eat ? __eou__ Yes ! You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol . You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish . __eou__ If I do all this do you think I can lose twenty pounds in four weeks ? __eou__ Don ’ t count on it . __eou__
Do you know that song ? __eou__ Which song ? __eou__ The song you hear now . __eou__ No , I've never heard of this song before . It's beautiful ! Who sing it ? __eou__ Elvis Presley . Don't you recognize his voice ? __eou__ No . How about going to karaoke tonight ? __eou__ Good idea . __eou__
How are you ? __eou__ Fine . __eou__ I haven ’ t seen you for several days . __eou__ Oh , I have been with my uncle for a week . __eou__ What ’ s he doing ? __eou__ He is an accountant . I have been helping him for a week . __eou__ He must be happy . __eou__ Yeah . How are you these days ? __eou__ Fine too . __eou__
What did you do this weekend , Kate ? __eou__ Oh , Diane and I went for a drive in the country on Saturday . __eou__ That sounds nice . Where did you go ? __eou__ We drove to the lake and had a picnic . We had a great time ! How about you ? Did you do anything special ? __eou__ Not really . I just worked on my car all day . __eou__ That old thing ! Why don't you just buy a new one ? __eou__ But then what would I do every weekend ? __eou__
I ’ d better be going . __eou__ So soon . Why don ’ t you stay a little longer ? __eou__ I wish I could , but It ’ s already late . __eou__ Oh . It ’ s pity you have to leave . __eou__ thank you for wonderful meat . __eou__ I'm glad you enjoy it . __eou__
Did you remember to bring back that software I lent to you ? __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry . It completely slipped my mind . __eou__ That ’ s ok . If you could just bring it in tomorrow , I would appreciate it . __eou__ Definitely , I ’ m really sorry . __eou__
Well , known , Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of computers , I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thought . __eou__ But I ... I don't agree with that , because computers weaken kids ' ability to think , because kids don't learn basic skills . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ They can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more.that ' s because they rely on gadgets . __eou__ That's not the gadgets.Creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . __eou__
All right . But these are black and I don ’ t like black shoes . They ’ re dull . __eou__ Well , black is a better color than pink . Pink ’ s for girls . __eou__ Then why are you wearing black shoes ? __eou__ Because ... oh , all right . You win . Let ’ s pay for them and go . __eou__ Hey , thanks , mum . __eou__
Hey , Mike . Can I ask you something ? __eou__ Sure , what's up ? __eou__ I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . Who do you think will win ? __eou__ Good question . I have to think about it . __eou__ My husband is betting on France . __eou__ France ? Is he crazy ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , how do I put this ? France is a terrible team . __eou__
How do you do . I ’ m Mark Rancor . __eou__ Nice to meet you . __eou__ May I know your name , please ? __eou__ I ’ m Rose Teller . I think I ’ Ve seen you somewhere before ? __eou__ Ah , yes . I remember now . Were you Mr . John ’ s dinner partner last month ? __eou__ Yes , I was . You work for 3M , right ? __eou__ I did but now I ’ m for Microsoft . How are things with you ? __eou__ Good . __eou__ May I know what you do ? __eou__ I ’ m a fashion designer . Next month , I have a fashion show . I ’ d love it if come . I can get you a couple of tickets . So you can bring a friend if you like . __eou__ Sure . That would be great . Good luck . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
What's the name of the series just showed ? __eou__ Doctor Butcher . __eou__ What a horrible name ! Is it full of suspense ? __eou__ No , not at all.it ' s about how to keep fit . __eou__
What ’ s “ pi ” ? __eou__ That ’ s the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter , I think . __eou__ I see . What is that ratio exactly ? __eou__ It ’ s approximately 3.14 , but the number continues forever . What ’ s the diameter of your circle ? __eou__ It ’ s 10 centimeters , so the circumference should be 31.4 centimeters . __eou__ Ok . My next problem is to convert 10000 british pounds into us dollars . What ’ s the exchange rate at the moment ? __eou__ According to the newspaper , the exchange rate is 1.85 dollars to the pound . __eou__ That means that 10.000 pounds will buy me 18.500 dollars . __eou__ What ’ s the next question . __eou__ Fractions . What ’ s a quarter and an eighth ? That ’ s three-eights . Easy . The next question is “ what are prime numbers ? ” . __eou__ I can help you there . Those are numbers that cannot be created by multiplying two whole numbers , apart from the number itself and 1 , together . __eou__ So , 1,2 and 3 are prime numbers , but 4 isn ’ t because 2 * 2 = 4 . __eou__ Exactly . Anything else ? __eou__ How many seconds in an hour ? 60 seconds multiplied by 60 minutes equals 3600 seconds altogether . __eou__ You ’ ll be a mathematician one day . __eou__
How's your new car ? __eou__ Perfect . Couldn't be better ! __eou__ You made a good choice , then ? __eou__ It's just what I wanted . __eou__ No regrets ? __eou__ I'm really pleased with it . Thanks . __eou__ I'm glad you're so happy . __eou__ It's super . __eou__
Thank you.Steven.That was the most magnificent meal I've had abroad.You ' ll have to let me reciprocate the next time you're in Beijing . __eou__ Don't worry about it , Lin.That ' s no big deal.You know , Americans appreciate China's rich culinary culture . Just excuse me for a second while I check the number here and figure out how much to give the waiter.Hmm , by the way , what do you do about tipping in China ? __eou__ We don't . __eou__ No tipping ? Now that's what I call a civilized system . __eou__ At hotels and some restaurants they add a service charge to the bill , but other than that , tipping isn't customary . __eou__ What about cab drivers and porters ? __eou__ In a cab you just pay what it says on the meter . I generally tip hotel porters 10 yuan per bag , but in first-class hotels they're instructed not to accept gratuities . __eou__ You'd have a revolution on your hands if you tried to introduce that sort of system here . __eou__
Morning , Mary . I haven't seen you in a long time . What's up ? __eou__ Oh , I took up a new hobby . __eou__ So you don't travel a lot now ? __eou__ No , Frank . I'm much more interested in collecting stamps now . __eou__ It's certainly a popular hobby . I know a lot of people love stamps . __eou__ It certainly is . It's so much fun . __eou__ I believe collecting stamps has something similar to traveling right ? __eou__ Absolutely . Through all kinds of stamps I am able to learn about the world . __eou__ Well , every stamp has a story to tell . __eou__ You're right . And I also meet many new friends while collecting stamps . __eou__ Good . __eou__ Sometimes we even spend hours discussing our collections . __eou__ There's a lot to share when you have a common interest . __eou__ Yes , it's really amazing .

No man could ever make anything like this . __eou__ What is that below ? __eou__ It is the Colorado River . You will go down the river in a boat if you wish . __eou__ No , thank you.It looks a bit too dangerous for me . __eou__ There is a beautiful state park here . I can see why so many people come out here to camp . __eou__ Yes , there is this beautiful view . you may go fishing , camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air . __eou__ It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city . __eou__ You are so romantic , my sweetheart . __eou__
Our neighbour ’ s tape recorder is so loud that it annoys us to death . I ’ Ve made up my mind to cut the electricity off . __eou__ What ? That would be to cut off your nose to spite your face . __eou__ Then what shall I do ? __eou__ Call the police . __eou__
David , what's new with you ? You are not in the mood . Can you tell me ? __eou__ After six months , my college life will come to the end . The following trouble will be the job-hunting . That's really a headache . __eou__ Do not take things so seriously , my pal ! Every one of us will face the trouble and job-hunting is inevitable . Take it easy ! Believe in yourself and some day you will be successful . __eou__ It sounds reasonable . Maybe I should look on the bright side . __eou__
What's the matter ? You don't look well . __eou__ I am worried . __eou__ What about ? __eou__ My exam . __eou__ Oh , is that all ? __eou__ I feel very nervous about it . __eou__ Don't worry about it . Try to look on the bright sight of things . __eou__

She's pretty and meek . __eou__ No , I can't agree with you . She's one but not the other . __eou__ What makes you think so ? __eou__ She's my wife , you know . __eou__
Hey , did you hear the news ? __eou__ No , what's up ? __eou__ Miss Yang is dating the manager who's married . __eou__ You're joking ! __eou__ No joke ! That's why she hasn't married yet . __eou__
David , why didn ’ t you clean the room ? __eou__ I ’ m not in the mood . __eou__ Why are you feeling depressed ? __eou__ I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down . __eou__ I don ’ t think she will do such a thing . __eou__ But she did and made me disappointed . __eou__ Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything . __eou__ But she means a lot to me . __eou__ Then forgive her mistake . __eou__ Oh . I just can ’ t forget it . __eou__
Betty , would you please read this letter of application I've just written ? I'd like to have your opinion . __eou__ I'd be glad to tell you what I think . __eou__ Good ! I'm interested in your advice . __eou__ If I were you , I would change the beginning . You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities . __eou__ Good idea , Betty . What would you think about the second part ? __eou__ I think it's too short . You'd better say something about your work experience . __eou__ You're right , I'll change it . How about the last part ? __eou__ Very good . But you should talk about your family , too . __eou__ I agree . I appreciate your helping me . __eou__
Well , everything is packed and ready to go . __eou__ It's hard to believe that we're really leaving . The past two weeks was like a dream . __eou__ Yes . Just think the blue sky , sunshine , mouth-watering food , centuries-old castles - - __eou__ And the people were so friendly ! __eou__ Yeah , we would have been lost without the help of the locals . __eou__ Do you still remember the small restaurant at the corner of the street ? __eou__ Of course . That was the best pasta I've ever had . __eou__ I ate so much that I wasn't hungry until afternoon the next day . __eou__ If only we could eat there once more ! __eou__ Maybe we can come here again next summer . __eou__ Hope the restaurant is still there . __eou__ Hey , what's the time ? __eou__ Oh , my god ! Only two hours left before the plane takes off . We need to be at the airport now . __eou__ Don't worry . We can call a cab . It'll be alright . __eou__

What do you say ? __eou__ That ’ s not a bad idea . Bet after all you should get some sound financial guarantee . __eou__
What are the seasons like in your city ? __eou__ Summers is hot and usually lasts a long time . Winters are short , but cold , wet , and windy . I love the summers in my city , but I hate the wintertime . __eou__ Does it ever rain in summer ? __eou__ We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks , but apart from that , summers are dry . Thunderstorms make the air fresh again , so most people don ’ t mind then . __eou__ What are spring and autumn like ? __eou__ I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again . In spring , the weather is very changeable-sometimes cold , sometimes warm . It ’ s usually windy with some rain . Autumn is usually sunny an __eou__ Well , I live in the southern hemisphere , so our summertime is your wintertime , and vice versa . We get some rain in every season , but most is in winter . In winter , it sometimes gets cold , but our wine __eou__ Do you usually go on a summer holiday ? __eou__ No , I don ’ t . I go on a winter holiday instead . I go somewhere warm . __eou__ I usually go on holiday during the spring or the autumn . I try to go somewhere where the weather is more reliable than in my city . __eou__
I have some good news for you . We've decided we'd like to send you to Shanghai on a business trip this weekend . __eou__ oh . __eou__ don't you think that it'd be a good thing for you to get out of the office for a couple of days ? __eou__ sure . __eou__ I thought you'd be a bit more excited about this . Everything will be paid for and I'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you . All you have to do it get on the train tonight a __eou__ the train ? Will I be flying back then ? __eou__ oh , no . We've brought your return ticket for you . I think you'll find it comfortable . __eou__ will the train be very crowded ? __eou__ oh no . the train hasn't been crowded at all recently . Besides , you're in first-class , so you'll be fine . __eou__ when is the first meeting then ? __eou__ they've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9:00 tomorrow morning . That should give you enough time to have a quick shower . __eou__ where will I be staying ? __eou__ we've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings , so you won't need to deal much with the transportation system . __eou__ that's very sensible . Would it be alright if I left early today to prepare for the trip ? __eou__ that's not a problem . Have a nap if you can . You don't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip . __eou__
what ? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I forget all about it . __eou__ How could you ? I reminded you just this morning . __eou__ It's leap my mind . I really feel terrible about it . __eou__ I have been looking forward to this performance all month . __eou__ I'm really sorry I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow . __eou__
Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? __eou__ You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . __eou__ What do you mean ? It will help us to relax . __eou__ Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ? __eou__ I guess you are right . But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home . __eou__ I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends . __eou__ That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play singsong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . __eou__ Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too . __eou__ Good . Let's go now . __eou__ All right . __eou__
Have you heard anything about Markweed Inc . ? They have called me back for interview , and I'm considering taking a job with them . __eou__ Well , to start with , Markweed Inc . has a reputation for being one of the best employers in the field . __eou__ The best ... huh ? With so many companies out there , how did they establish themselves in such a solid position on top ? __eou__ First of all , they have an excellent benefits package for all employees , even the maintenance staff have health and dental coverage . __eou__ Really ? What about the pay rate ? Are the wages pretty high ? __eou__ From what I hear , they are very reasonable . A lot of the prestige the company has built is because they have attacked some high profile employees with their incentives . __eou__ Well , what about the work environment ? Not every one is motivated solely by money . __eou__ It's a great place to work . They give you fair pay and benefits , and a lot of room to grow . I think if they off you a job , you should definitely take it . __eou__
Terrible . How about people's lives ? __eou__ Fortunately , there is no person died . __eou__ That's great . It seems that Typhoon is not as bad as earthquake . __eou__ Yeah . Earthquake is one of the most badly natural disasters in the world . __eou__ That's why many people died in the earthquake . __eou__ Well , China is located on the Eurasia plate , where earthquakes happen frequently due to the earth's plates knocking against each other . __eou__ Oh , China does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history . __eou__ Yeah , we've experienced the 8.0 magnitude earthquake in Wenchman . __eou__ We're all familiar with natural disasters . but we still feel weak when we face Wenchman earthquake . __eou__ Right . But people at that time only know two words , " save " and " assistance " , they will never don't lift a finger . Life is the most important compared with anything else . __eou__ That's the point . Love among human beings is not limited by geography . __eou__
Do I have to take these books here if I want to renew them ? __eou__ You can renew the books over the computer . __eou__ That's so convenient . __eou__

The jewellery told me that there are few gold mines in your country . The gold was found in mountain steams . __eou__ That ’ s right . A few people go panning for gold in rivers . __eou__ You have many trees in your country . That ’ s another natural resources . __eou__ It ’ s a natural resources that we hardly use . Government policy is to conserve those forests . __eou__ I see . That ’ s probably a good idea . Too many forest are being destroyed . __eou__ Is your country ’ s environment being damaged by the oil industry ? __eou__ We have some inspections , but it is very hard to avoid pollution when extracting oil . There has been some damage , but it is under control . __eou__

There will be a party in my company ; what shall I wear ? __eou__ Is it formal or informal ? __eou__ I guess it is a formal one because the general director will give a speech there , and most of the staff will take part in . __eou__ In that case , formal suit with a nice tie will be better . __eou__ You are right . What about shoes ? __eou__ The brown leather shoes are OK . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__ Don ’ t mention it . __eou__

I ’ m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office . __eou__ Why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ? __eou__ What do you suggest ? I can ’ t afford to quit my job until I get a new one . __eou__ Maybe you have two choices . You could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training . __eou__
I just dropped in to say good-bye . __eou__ What time are you leaving ? __eou__ I'm going to try to leave by ten . __eou__ Take care and give my best to your parents . __eou__ Good-bye . Hope to see you soon again next year . __eou__ Don't forget to call us if you're in Tokyo . __eou__

And then we can discuss about the travelling costs . __eou__

I look more like my mother . __eou__
We have to pick up Conrad before the party . __eou__ Alright , no problem . __eou__ We're supposed to meet him at Cal's Bar at 10 __eou__ Wait a minute . Cal's bar ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ That's a gay bar . __eou__ Yes , it is . Conrad is gay . Didn't you know ? __eou__ I thought he was maybe gay , but I wasn't sure.Anyhow , you don't expect me to go into a gay bar , do you ? __eou__ Why not ?

I'm not gay , you know . Why should I go in a gay bar ? __eou__ You sound like you're afraid . __eou__ I just wouldn't be comfortable . __eou__ You've never been in a gay bar before ? __eou__ No , never . __eou__ But it's just a bar .

There is nothing strange about it.If Conrad's there , we'll leave for the party.If he's not , we'll sit down and have a drink . __eou__ Okay . I will try it . I suppose it isn't reasonable for me to refuse to go in.After all , gay people aren't afraid to go into normal bars . __eou__ I'm glad you feel that way.We ' ll leave in about ten minutes , alright ? __eou__ Fine . __eou__

I hear that you are going to participate in the dinner party tonight.Seen from what you are dressing , you really look like a fox . __eou__ Yeah , I think it will be wonderful . __eou__
I was just watching a documentary on tv about people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting . __eou__ I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers . __eou__ The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow . __eou__ Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation . __eou__ Don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts . __eou__ Can you ride a horse ? __eou__ Yes , I can .

Do you want to ask her out ? __eou__ Sure , but how ? __eou__ You can ask her out for drink after work . __eou__ But for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am . __eou__ Then you've got a lot of homework to do . You need to get her notice first . __eou__ Easier said than done . __eou__ You can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her . __eou__ But I always get tongue-tied when I see her . __eou__ That's something you need to overcome .

How much did you pay ? __eou__ $ 14,500 . It only has 10,000 miles on it , so it ’ s like a new car . __eou__ Does that mean you ’ re not going to take the train to work anymore ? __eou__ Well , sometimes , I think it ’ ll be nice to drive to work instead . We ’ ll see . Want to go for a ride ? __eou__ Yeah , sure . __eou__ Come on . __eou__
What are your plans for this weekend ? __eou__ I'd like to hire a bike . I think it would be a good idea to do some cycling on Sunday . __eou__ If the weather's fine . __eou__ I am sure it will be . It's been good so far this weekend . __eou__ I know a good place to hire bikes if you want . __eou__ Thanks . That would be really helpful . __eou__ But remember , be careful when you ride a bike .

Come in , come in , what can I do for you ? __eou__ Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ? __eou__ Yes , I am applying on it . __eou__ I wonder if I could enroll in it . I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior , but ... __eou__ Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up . __eou__ I know , but geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field . __eou__ Well , if you think you are ready , I'll let you enroll . __eou__ Oh , thanks , professor Donald.this is very nice of you . __eou__
Good evening , John . __eou__ Good evening , Mary . __eou__ How are you doing ? __eou__ I'm doing fine , thanks.What ' s new with you ? __eou__ Nothing special . __eou__ I'm wondering whether you could come over for a pizza sometime next week ? __eou__ Sounds good.Sorry , here comes my bus.You call me , or I'll call you to make a date . __eou__ I'll call you . __eou__ All right.Gotta go , bye , keep in touch . __eou__ Have a great day , take care , bye . __eou__
How'd you like to go on a bungee jump this weekend ? __eou__ I'm not sure . I promised to help my sister move Saturday . __eou__ How about Sunday , then ? We could start in the morning . __eou__ I might be able to do that . But I don't think I can do it well . __eou__ Don't worry . It is a test of physical endurance , intelligence . Just to finish it is considered a victory for most . __eou__ OK . I'll talk to you later . __eou__
I must apologize for having delayed the work . __eou__ No , that ’ s not all your fault . __eou__ But you will miss your good chance . I ’ m So sorry __eou__ There ’ s no need to apologize.Forget about it . __eou__
Oh dear , my weight has gone up again . __eou__ I am not surprised , you eat too much . __eou__ And I suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help . __eou__ No , I wouldn't think so . __eou__ I do wish I could lose weight . __eou__ Well , why don't you go on the diet ? __eou__ I've tried diets before but they've never worked . __eou__ Perhaps you should excercise more .

Hi , Larry , how was your weekend ? __eou__ Not bad . We had a get-together with friends from college . I haven't seen many of them since graduation . How about you ? __eou__ Great . I hung out with Jo all day shopping , and the went out for dinner together . __eou__ Sounds a good weekend . You know it always amazes me that two people as different as you and Jo can become such close friends . __eou__ Yeah , I never thought we could be good friends either . We have our differences . She's more outgoing and active while I am more quiet and reversed , but we still get along extremely well . We can talk for hours about anything . __eou__ That's great . I know people who can't stand each other for even five minutes . __eou__ When Jo and I are together , we argue a lot , but that's also part of the fun . Besides , I know she will always be there for me when I need her , and she knows I'll be there for her . __eou__ It seems you two bring out the best of one another . __eou__ Exactly . Having Jo as my friend is one of the best things that's ever happened to me . __eou__ Yeah , you are so lucky to have found each other . __eou__ Thanks , I think so too . __eou__
What ’ s the matter , Sally ? You look so unhappy . __eou__ I had a bad day yesterday . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I went to the library and lost my bag . __eou__ Your bag ? Did you get it back ? __eou__ I went back for it . But it was already gone . __eou__ That ’ s too bad . I ’ m sorry to hear that . __eou__
Are you free this evening , Li ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid I ’ m busy tonight . I ’ m having dinner with friends . __eou__ What a pity . I wanted to go for a drink with you . __eou__ What about tomorrow ? Are you doing anything tomorrow ? __eou__ No , I haven ’ t got any plans . __eou__ Shall we go out tomorrow then ? __eou__ Why not ? Sounds good to me . __eou__
Do you like a package tour or to travel alone ? __eou__ I prefer a package tour , and we don't have to worry about accommodation , meals or that sort of trivial demanding things . __eou__ I prefer travel alone . I'll have a lot of time lingering at one place . __eou__
Here , Let me get the door for you . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ Do you need a hand with that ? __eou__ Actually , I could you some help . Thank you so much . __eou__ Don't worry about it . __eou__
Sam , what shall I do with my stocks ? Will I lose money ? __eou__ There ’ s a possibility . __eou__ What do you mean by that ? __eou__ I mean if you don ’ t sell your shares now , it ’ s quite likely that you ’ ll end up losing your shirt . __eou__ Is that so ? __eou__ Absolutely . Take my word for it . __eou__
You should have seen the line at the housing office.It took me an hour to make my dormitory deposit for next year . Have you made yours yet ? __eou__ No , I ’ m not sure I ’ m going to . __eou__ Why not ? There ’ s not much time left . Are you short of cash ? __eou__ No , thanks . I am okay . __eou__ You ’ d better hurry up if you wanna a dorm room next September ... __eou__ Well , actually , I am thinking about living off campus . __eou__ Do you have any idea how much that would cost ? __eou__ I know it would be more expensive . I think I could handle it though . It ’ s that this dorm is so noisy that I can ’ t get anything done . __eou__ You should study in the library the way I do . Think of the money you ’ d save . __eou__ I ’ Ve got to think it over some more . __eou__ I hope you will have second thoughts . __eou__
What a wonderful party ! I had a good time . How about you ? __eou__ I enjoyed myself , too . __eou__ Shall I give you a ride home ? __eou__ Yes , if it's not too much of a trouble . __eou__ It's no trouble at all because your house is on the way to my place . __eou__ That's great . Let's go ! __eou__

Have you heard that Mel Gibson was arrested by the police last week ? __eou__ No , not yet . Why ? __eou__ For suspicion of driving under influence . __eou__ Oh . I am not his fan . __eou__

Isn't this lovely weather ? Will you help me water the flowers , Jack ? __eou__ Well , do you think I have to ? __eou__ I do.We haven't watered them for quite a few days . __eou__ Please look at the sky.Don ' t you see the dark clouds ? It's going to rain soon . __eou__ Good.So we don't have to work.How nice ! __eou__ But I don't think it's so nice . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ The weather report says it's going to rain for a whole week . __eou__ Oh , I'm afraid all the flowers will die in the rain . __eou__
Can you speak English ? __eou__ Yes I can . I speak it very well . __eou__ Where did you learn it ? __eou__ I lived in England when I was a child . __eou__ What else can you speak ? __eou__ Well , I know a little Italian . __eou__
What ’ s the difference between football and rugby ? __eou__ Those tow games are quite different . First , there ’ s the size of the teams . In football , a team has 11 players . In rugby there are 15 players on each team . The biggest difference is that in football , only the goalkeeper can use his hands . In rugby , the ball is usually carried forward by players , though kicking is permitted . __eou__ In rugby , players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates , don ’ t they ? __eou__ That ’ s right . However , players can only pass the ball backwards . They cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates . That ’ s a foul . __eou__ I know how goals are scored in football , but how about in rugby ? __eou__ If a team carries the ball over the goal line , they score points . A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch . __eou__ There ’ s a lot more physical contact in rugby , isn ’ t there ? __eou__ Yes . Players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball . This is called ” tackling ” , as in football . __eou__ The ball is a different shape in rugby , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Yes . It ’ s not perfectly round like a football . A rugby ball is oval in shape . There ’ s a match on TV this afternoon . Why don ’ t you watch it with me ? I ’ ll try to explain the rules and tactics while we ’ re watching . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
What do you say to eating out , Maggie ? __eou__ Yeah , why not ? We haven't been out for dinner for quite a long time . A new French restaurant has just opened in our neighborhood . We can go there . __eou__ Do we need to book a table in advance ? __eou__ No need for that . It's not usually busy on weekdays . __eou__ What time shall we go ? __eou__ Why not now ? I'm hungry . __eou__
How do you like other films starring Charlie Chaplin ? __eou__ Well , I like others very much , but I really don't think much of this one . __eou__ You don't like the performance , do you ? __eou__ Yes , but I don't like the story . __eou__
Who's that striking woman over there ? __eou__ Hm ? Oh , that's Alice . She's totally mad . Don't get yourself in a room alone with her . __eou__ Really ? Why not ? She looks great . __eou__ Yes , I know , but she's dangerous . __eou__ Really ? Tell me more . __eou__ Well , I'm not one to gossip , as you know , but rumor has it that she sued her former boss for sexual harassment . __eou__ Wow , crikey . So what happened ? __eou__ Well , this is just between ourselves , of course , but he was her lover and he wanted to leave her , so she got revenge . I heard him say she was a dangerous woman . __eou__ Wow . __eou__ Oh , while we're on the subject , what happened to you and your secretary ? __eou__ I have no idea what you're talking about . __eou__ Oh , come on . Everybody knows . __eou__ Could you excuse me a moment ? I have to make a phone call __eou__ Oh , sure . __eou__
What is the movie you saw last night ? __eou__ It is a new film , ' Transformer ' . __eou__ How do you like it ? __eou__ I expected too high from that movie , but I was a bit disappointed about it . __eou__ But I heard the box office rose up to 15 million in the first week . __eou__ Box office can't explain everything . I do not think it is cheerful or well-made . The plot is old and the female character is not pretty . __eou__ My sister has given me two tickets for tonight . It is called ' The life of Rose ' , a French movie . __eou__ What's it about ? __eou__ It tells the lifetime of a lady singer from a beggar in the street to a famous singer in the world . It is a kind of tragedy . __eou__ I prefer the tragedy . It is moving and makes me ponder about my life . __eou__ Let's go . The time is coming . __eou__ We can buy the popcorn before entering the cinema . __eou__
Hi ! Peter . How are you ? __eou__ Fine ! How about you ? __eou__ Pretty good . __eou__
I cannot ignore her suggestion . In fact I always value her suggestion . __eou__ I know . Maybe you will get the air if you go against her . __eou__ Well , it takes two to to make a happy marriage . __eou__ And it takes two to make an agreement too . You have no guts , I am afraid . __eou__
Who ’ s that ? __eou__ It ’ me . Susan Taylor __eou__ Oh , please come in . nice to see you . __eou__ On , what ’ re you doing ? You look as busy as a bee . __eou__ Yeah , I ’ m trying to decorate my house . __eou__ Really , that ’ s cool . Let me see what you ’ Ve done . __eou__ But actually it ’ s not done yet . I ’ m going to get a special pendent lamp . __eou__ That ’ s all right . Let me see , oh , that lace looks so unique , and it ’ s so creative to make a picture display here . How did you get that idea ? __eou__ It ’ s just a simple decorating . I just want to add my personality to my living space . __eou__
Do you like music ? __eou__ Well , it depends . __eou__ Do you think the music is well-matched ? __eou__ No , I think the music is too fast . __eou__ How about the words of the song ? __eou__ It sounds nice . __eou__ I like it . Naturally it can arouse your feelings . __eou__ Yes , I think so . It's very emotional . __eou__ Of course , and I also like the rhythms . __eou__ Full of energy and hope . __eou__ Really . It's worth listening to and enjoying . __eou__ Certainly it is . It's worth an Academy Award . __eou__
Hey , Wen ! Welcome to D . C . ! Glad you came out to visit ! __eou__ Thanks for inviting me . Actually , I've never been anywhere with so many black people before . It's different . __eou__ Howard is eighty percent black . But there are whites , and even Asians here . Thankfully , it's also coed . __eou__ Great ! Is your , too ? __eou__ Sorry , nope . But the Alpha Phi Alpha's are throwing a party tonight . __eou__ That's a black fraternity , right ? So we should see some dancing ! __eou__
How could you handle living in such a big family ? Does everyone get along ? __eou__ Sure . We love each other and take care of each other . __eou__ In such a big family , there must be a head . Who's the head of your family ? __eou__ My grandpa . He has the final word about almost everything . My grandpa is “ President , ” and Grandma is “ Vice-President . ” My parents , uncles and aunts try to arrive at a consensus on important questions . __eou__ Is a family like yours common in South Korea ? __eou__ No . Not anymore.Mine is highly educated but traditional family . Most South Korea families today are a lot smaller . In traditional families , the old people are well respected and taken good care of . Ho __eou__ My family setup is a bit different . In New York city , there're only three people , my mother , my stepfather and me . During this summertime , I fly out to California and live with my dad . Dad's getting __eou__ Of course there'll be a room for you ! __eou__ To be blunt , maybe I won't be able to get along with his new wife or her kids . __eou__ Yours is a modern family . I'm sure your dad loves you and would want you to stay for the summer . You just need to try your best to get along with your new stepmother and her boys . __eou__ But four boys ! __eou__ It will be a new experience , and you might as well learn to adjust to changes . __eou__ You are right , I guess.The world keeps changing , and so do families . But I like a small-sized or medium-sized family where everybody is equal to everybody else . That's what I want . __eou__ It is good to have goals in life . If California doesn't work out , come and visit me in Korea , OK ? __eou__ That's a great idea ! __eou__ We could share a room ! It would be fun . And we could do some traveling around Korea . You could see for yourself what life in a big family is like ! __eou__ That sounds like an excellent offer . I might take you up on that . Thank you for the wonderful invitation . __eou__
Hello , Kate . __eou__ Hi , Peter . I didn't see you last night . Where did you go ? __eou__ I was almost on line the whole night . __eou__ Did you play network games the whole night ? __eou__ No , I listened to the music , too . __eou__ What are you going to do now ? __eou__ I'm tired . I need a rest . __eou__
I'm going to have some people over for dinner Saturday night.Would you like to join us ? __eou__ Oh , I'm afraid I'll be busy tomorrow evening . __eou__ Some other time then ? __eou__ OK.Thanks for asking me . __eou__
Ma , I really don't know how to thank you . __eou__ I'm glad I was able to help . __eou__ It's most kind of you . __eou__ Don't mention it . It was the least I could do . __eou__ If there's ever anything I can do for you , Don't hesitate to let me know . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ I'm most grateful . __eou__ It was a pleasure . __eou__
You're acting weird tonight . __eou__ I'm just in the mood to act goofy . __eou__ What brought this on ? __eou__ I guess I'm glad exams are over . __eou__
Hey , Mary , can you cut that out ? __eou__ Cut what out I ’ m not doing anything . __eou__ The tapping of your pen on your desk . It ’ s driving me crazy . __eou__ Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup ! __eou__ I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ? __eou__ You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? __eou__ Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are . __eou__ Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down . __eou__ Yeah , I ’ ll try to do the same.So , I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night ? __eou__
what do you think about all the different diets people go on ? __eou__ I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! __eou__ but what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? __eou__ they need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . __eou__ so you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ? __eou__ sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small desert . __eou__ how about drinking soda ? __eou__ many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try __eou__ that's good advice . Have you ever tried taking vitamins ? __eou__ my mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . __eou__ how do you know so much about food and dieting ? __eou__ you might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size than I am now ! __eou__
Bill , I have received the admission letter from Cambridge University ! __eou__ Congratulations ! __eou__ How about you ? Have you got any news from university ? __eou__ No . But I am going to apply for some vocational schools . I like fashion design and want to study it . __eou__ I am glad you can study something you really like ! __eou__
John , if you don't mind , I'd like to ask you a personal question . __eou__ I don't mind at all . __eou__ All right . Are you married ? __eou__ To tell you the truth , I'm not married . I'm still single . __eou__ Then , when do you plan to get married ? __eou__ I don't know . It's still up in the air . __eou__
Bob , put on your shoes , your feet are really smelly . __eou__ No foot gives out scent . __eou__ But don't forget you are in a cafe . __eou__ Never mind , the odour of my feet will quicken their eating speed . __eou__ I simply can't bear your barbaric behavior . __eou__ Don ’ t pretend you are a good God . __eou__ You should feel shameful for your behavior . __eou__ I've never experienced such a kind of feeling . __eou__ I'm really sick of you . __eou__
What are you doing over the weekend , Sara ? __eou__ I'm planing to go bowling tonight . Tomorrow I was hoping to see a movie . What about you ? __eou__ I want to go camping , you know , just get a way for the weekend . I'm not sure I'll be able to , though . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Well , I have a lot of work . I'll see how it goes . __eou__
She is kind of player who never hides how she's feeling . Once look at her and you know if she's winning or losing . __eou__ She wears her heart on her sleeve . __eou__
Good afternoon , Johnson . __eou__ Good afternoon , Mary . How's business ? __eou__ Not bad , thanks . __eou__
hey Ayden , I was wondering if you could do me a favor . __eou__ that depends . What is it ? __eou__ it's kind of a big favor . I'm absolutely flat broke , and I owe my landlady $ 200 . she's given me until Friday to give it to her , but I don't get paid until next Monday . Do you think you could loans __eou__ I'd love to help you out , but I'm a bit short on cash this month as well . I had to get a new engine put into my car , and that ate up my savings . __eou__ if you can't give me the full amount , a fraction of it would still help . I'll pay you back on Monday . I promise . __eou__ let's see , I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend . I can only spare about $ 20 . I would give you more if I had it , I just don't have much money to my name right now . __eou__ thanks a lot Ayden . Every little bit will help . Tell you what , if you aren't doing anything tonight , why don't you come over and have dinner at my place . __eou__ that'd be great . Thanks ! What time should I come over ? __eou__ how about at 6 pm ? __eou__ see you then ! __eou__
You don't have to play that record so loud , do you ? __eou__ I'm sorry . Has it been bothering you ? __eou__ Yes . And please ask me the next time you want to use something . __eou__ I'm sorry . I meant to ask you . __eou__
I'm going over to the gym . I want to do some running . __eou__ Why don't you run outside ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? Do you know how cold it is today ? __eou__ Yeah , I suppose . I guess it isn't healthy to run in this weather . __eou__ No , it's not . Not at all . I'd probably freeze my lungs . __eou__ Wait for me a minute . I'll go over to the gym too . __eou__ You ? __eou__ Yes , why not ? Just let me get my gym clothes together . __eou__ I didn't know you could exercise . __eou__ What do you mean by that ? Everyone can exercise ! __eou__ Yeah , I know . But you ? I always thought you were only good at lifting beer bottles to your mouth . __eou__ No , not at all . I was on the swimming team in high school.And I'd like to do some weight training . They have decent equipment at that gym . __eou__ You're going to lift weights ? Hah ! __eou__ Are you laughing at me ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I just can't imagine you lifting weights . __eou__ Maybe not . But I want to start . I need to get in shape . I feel these past couple months that my energy is low . __eou__ It's true . If a person doesn't exercise , they get sluggish.That ' s why I keep running . Even in the winter . __eou__ So I need to do something too . __eou__ But lifting weights isn't the best thing.You should do some kind of aerobic exercise . __eou__ I know . But I want to start today with a little weight lifting.Then I'm going to buy a new swimming suit and goggles , and every other day I'm going to go swim laps in the pool . How does that sound ? __eou__ It sounds like a good plan to me . I'm still ... I mean ... __eou__ What ? __eou__ I'm still just surprised you really want to do it.It doesn't seem to go with your character . __eou__
The boss is mad at you . __eou__ Who cares ? __eou__
Bob , what are you thinking about ? __eou__ I'm looking forward to going to America . __eou__ When do you go ? __eou__ Next week . __eou__
I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place ! __eou__ There certainly are a lot . Can you choose a favorite ? __eou__ Vanilla with toppings is my favorite . __eou__ Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae ? __eou__ No way ! Do you have a flavors you don't like ? __eou__ I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it . __eou__ I agree with that , it just doesn't work for me . __eou__ I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once . __eou__ I think that would be horrible ! __eou__ I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today ! __eou__
I heard that ben is forming his own band . __eou__ it will be a rock and roll band probably . He ’ s a very good guitarist . __eou__ can you play a musical instrument ? If you can , he might ask you to join the band . __eou__ I can play drums , but I haven ’ t played for a while . I ’ m not sure I ’ d be good enough to play in a band . __eou__ I wish I could play a musical instrument . I love music . __eou__ nowadays , you can be a DJ . You can mix dance music . You don ’ t need to be able to play musical instrument or sing . __eou__ I'd love to try it.but the equipment is expensive and it was still take a lot of practice . __eou__ you know , you could probably get a computer program that would help you . You already have a computer , so you could use that to help you mix some music . __eou__ that ’ s a great idea . I ’ ll search for some information on the internet . If it ’ s possible to do , the internet will have some information about it . __eou__
Hey , Frank , there is that Janet Check . __eou__ Wow , what a great burd ! __eou__ She sure knows how to strut her stuff . __eou__ She's a real turn-on our rights . __eou__ And look out she's dressed . __eou__ Yeah , I noticed . She must be really loaded . __eou__ No way . Her old man is rich . He buys her anything she wants . __eou__ Lucky her . Anyway , I think that is just as beautiful . __eou__ I think you've lost it . __eou__ Well , that's my opinion . __eou__ I admit that she is much prettier than Kate . __eou__ Oh , there is no comparison . Now we are talking but ugly . __eou__ At least we agree on that . Let's go and get a drink . __eou__
I'm going to America . __eou__ Any idea when you'll leave ? __eou__ I hope before the end of the month . __eou__ Let me know when you find out . __eou__
Who is Cindy ’ s husband ? __eou__ Cindy ’ s husband is Ron . __eou__ How many children do Cindy and Ron have ? __eou__ They have two children-one son and one daughter-as well as one daughter-in-law and one son-in-law . __eou__ Do they have any grandchildren ? __eou__ Yes , they have three grandchildren-one girl and two boys . __eou__ Does their daughters get along well with her in-laws ? __eou__ Yes , she gets along with them quite well . __eou__ Do they have a large family ? __eou__ Their family is very similar to Cindy and Ron ’ s family . __eou__
What do you think of doctor Thompson ? __eou__ I feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter's disease . __eou__ How can you be so sure ? __eou__ I can tell from the way he spoke to us . __eou__ Never believe his words . __eou__
Where do you live , Kim ? __eou__ I live in an apartment downtown . __eou__ Oh , that's convenient , but ... how much crime is there ? __eou__ Not much . But there is a lot of traffic . I can't stand the noise sometimes ! Where do you live ? __eou__ . I have a house in the suburbs . __eou__ Oh , I bet it's really quiet . But is there much to do there ? __eou__ No , not much . In fact , nothing ever really happens . That's the trouble . __eou__ Hey . Let's trade places one weekend ! __eou__ OK . Great idea ! __eou__
I must be going now . __eou__ Really ? Can ’ t you stay a little longer ? __eou__ No , I really must go now . My family are expecting me home soon . __eou__ Be seeing you then . __eou__ See you . __eou__
Good morning , Jerry . How's everything ? __eou__ Fine , just fine . Thanks . __eou__ Doing anything for lunch ? __eou__ Well , as a matter of fact , I've got a lunch date with Bob Thomas . __eou__
It's awfully hot . __eou__ You can say that again . __eou__
It seems a glorious day today . __eou__ I agree ... __eou__ It's beginning to spot . __eou__ Just now we both thought it would be fine . __eou__
I don't think I'm getting better . __eou__ Believe me , you really look much better than before . __eou__ I'm still not sure whether I can recover from it . __eou__
did you get my email ? __eou__ I certainly did . Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ? __eou__ sure . __eou__ how did the business trip go ? __eou__ well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss . __eou__ I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat ! __eou__ I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets ! __eou__ our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes . __eou__ I see . Well , then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . It was really tiring for me . __eou__ I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today . __eou__ thank you . I can't imagine getting much done today . I'm just too exhausted ! __eou__ no problem . Did you bring any gifts back for your department ? __eou__ no , should I have ? __eou__
Hello ! __eou__ Is that the box-office ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I'd like to book two tickets for the film ' Jane Eyre ' for this evening , please . __eou__ Just a minute please . Oh , I'm sorry , all the tickets for tonight have been sold out . __eou__ What a pity ! How about tomorrow evening ? __eou__ Oh , you're lucky , there are just two tickets left . Do you want to take them ? __eou__ Wonderful , I'll take them . __eou__ OK , your name and telephone number please . __eou__ Wang Min . Telephone number is 13811658 . Can I pick the tickets this afternoon ? __eou__ Yes , of course . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
I really like the book you lent me the other day . __eou__ I'm glad you like it . __eou__ And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long . __eou__ Not at all . __eou__ Everyone in our class enjoyed it too.It ' s very interesting . __eou__ Oh , I'm glad . __eou__ Would you mind me keeping it for another three days ? __eou__ No problem . __eou__
I've got to go home and study . __eou__ For what ? __eou__ The test tomorrow . __eou__ If you don't know it by now , you might as well not bother studying . __eou__
How did you first meet ? __eou__ My roommate invited both of us to dinner . __eou__ Was it love at first sight ? Did you fall in love with her the first time you met her ? __eou__ Yes ! The first time I saw her I knew we would fall in love . __eou__

You ’ re a wonderful person , Kathleen . __eou__ So you are . __eou__ And I ’ m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn ’ t truly worthy . __eou__ I feel exactly the same way with you . __eou__ Don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t say that . That , that makes it worse . __eou__ What ? You don ’ t love me ? Me , either . __eou__ You don ’ t love me ? __eou__ No . __eou__ But we ’ re so right for each other . __eou__ I know , I know . Well , is there some , is there someone else ? Oh , that woman on television , Sydney Ann . __eou__

Mom didn't know where to buy chopsticks for you . __eou__ Don't be silly ! I know how to use knives and forks . __eou__
Excuse me . would you lend me some wreckers __eou__ Until when ? __eou__ Until Monday or Tuesday next week . __eou__ No problem . __eou__
Shall we go to cinema this evening ? The new blockbuster starring mel gibson is showing . It ’ s supposed to be really good . __eou__ What kind of movie is it ? I don ’ t like many of his movies , actually . __eou__ It ’ s a thriller . It has Julia Roberts playing the female lead . __eou__ I like thrillers and I like Julia Roberts , so it might be interesting . I read a review today and the critic didn ’ t seem to be very impressed . __eou__ What did the critic say ? __eou__ He didn ’ t say it was bad , but he said that it wasn ’ t as good as it could have been , particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it . __eou__ The movie starts at eight o ’ clock , so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready . __eou__ Good . Dinner is nearly ready and I ’ d like to watch the news before we go . The Oscars were last night and I want to see the results . __eou__ I won ’ t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . There were a few surprises . __eou__
Do you have the five dollars I lent you yesterday ? __eou__ Oh I forgot ! I'll run home real quickly and bring you the money . __eou__ You don't have to go right away . __eou__ I'd hate for you to think I was lazy in returning your money . __eou__
What are your hobbies , Mr . Green ? __eou__ I like collecting stamps . __eou__ But it's an expensive hobby , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , you're right . What do you like to do in your spare time ? __eou__ I usually play chess with my friends . But I like playing basketball best . __eou__ Do you play basketball well ? __eou__ No , I'm not very good at it . I play just for the fun of it . __eou__ Shall we have a game together some day ? __eou__ OK , that'd be very nice . __eou__
Are you satisfied with the dishes ? __eou__ Great , the lamb stew tastes incredible . __eou__ I like it , too . I like the fish especially . It's so fresh , and the flavoury is kind of like for a fresh water fish . __eou__ Yes , the food here deserves its reputation . Chinese food is one of my favorites 。 __eou__ If you like , I'll take you to a new restaurant next time , I just heard about it from my friend , and he was just raving about it . It's such a great Sichuan cuisine . Would you like to try that ? __eou__ Sure , I'd love to . I heard Sichuan cuisine is very hot , I think I definitely love it . __eou__ Great , I love hot food too . __eou__ Well , let's finish this great dinner first . __eou__ You said it . __eou__
Hey Michelle . Good to see you . Are you at lunch ? __eou__ Oh hi Jim . No I just got back . I thought you were on vacation now . __eou__ No , I wish I was ! I just got back from Spain actually . __eou__ Oh wonderful ! Have you been there before or was it your first time ? __eou__ My first time . I've traveled around Europe a lot , but this was my first time to Spain . It was amazing , and the weather was just beautiful ! No rain , and just sun , sun , sun ... __eou__ I'm so jealous of you . I've never been anywhere in Europe . I've always dreamed of traveling around and seeing the sights . __eou__ Well , I really recommend Spain . You really should go . Anyway , it's been great to catch up , but I must be going , this is my floor . Speak again soon I hope . __eou__
That looks like an interesting book . __eou__ It is . It ’ s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world , with brief descriptions of how they were build , their purpose , and so on . __eou__ There are the pymeids . It ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though . __eou__ They don ’ t now , but most of them did originally . There ’ s picture of the pentagon in the United States . It ’ s very distinctive with its five sides . __eou__ Look at that cylindrical office building . I ’ Ve never been seen one that shape before . __eou__ Yes . Usually only towers are cylindrical in shape . __eou__ Tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . They ’ re not perfectly cylindrical . __eou__ This is the world ’ s largest sports stadium . It ’ s a massive oval . __eou__ What sports do they play there ? __eou__ It says here that it ’ s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings . __eou__ Is that building a perfect cube ? __eou__ According to the book , it is . I ’ Ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . Look at the building . From the air , it looks like a square with a semi-circle attached to each of its four sides . What kind of building is it ? __eou__ Is says here that it ’ s a war memorial . Now , there ’ s a distinctive structure-the stomium in Brussels . See ? It consists of several connected by cylinders . I believe you can go up and down inside it . __eou__
Yes , sir ? __eou__ I hate to complain , but this soup is too salty . __eou__ I'm very sorry.sir . I'll ask the manager to take care of this . __eou__
Are the galaxies in the universe moving through space ? __eou__ No , the galaxies sit more or less passively in the space around them . But not too much . As the space between galaxies expands , it carries the galaxies further apart - like raisins in an expanding dough . __eou__ But I heard that our Milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy . If galaxies are moving apart from each other , how can they collide ? __eou__ Well , the universe is a chaotic place , and the gravity from one galaxy , or from a group of galaxies , may disturb the motion of its near neighbors , causing them to collide . However , on average , when you compare two large enough chunks of space , the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other . __eou__ Wow , you're really informative . Thanks a lot . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
Isn ’ t he the best instructor ? I think * he ’ s so hot . Wow ! I really feel energized , don ’ t you ? __eou__ I swear , I ’ m going to kill you for this . __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? Didn ’ t you think it was fun ? ! __eou__ Oh , yeah ! I had a blast ! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ’ m just not into this health kick . __eou__ Oh , no , get off it . It wasn ’ t such a killer class . You just have to get into it . Like they say , no pain , no gain . __eou__ I am wiped out . Thank you . __eou__ Look , next time get yourself some comfy shoes . You ’ re gonna come back again with me , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Never ! But thank you for inviting me . __eou__ Come on . You ’ ll feel better after we hit the showers . __eou__
I like the design of the coat . __eou__ But I like its color . __eou__ Anyway , it's my ideal coat . I'll take it . __eou__ I'll take one , too . __eou__
Do you have any hobbies ? __eou__ Yes . I like gardening . __eou__ Oh , that's interesting . Do you have a garden ? __eou__ Yes , follow me . Here it is . __eou__ Your garden is really lovely . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Do you take care of them everyday ? __eou__ Yes , I do . __eou__ Don't you feel dull ? __eou__ I don't . I like the work . __eou__
What ? You golden watch is lost ? __eou__ Yeah . I just can't find it anywhere . __eou__ It's an open book that it was stolen by the man in black . __eou__ Let's get it back . __eou__
Good morning , Miss . __eou__ Morning . Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I'd like to know how to use the library . You know , I'm a new student here . __eou__ All you need is your student identification card to check out books . __eou__
Do you have much experience with kids ? __eou__ Yes . I have three sons . Actually I also have a grandson . __eou__ To tell you the truth , sometimes I regret having a baby so early . I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby . __eou__ I understand . I was in your position before . At that time I couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me . My husband seldom stayed at home . __eou__ What about your mother ? Did she help you ? __eou__ Yes , she did a little . But you see , Americans are different from Chinese . You can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . She could baby-sit only once or twice a week . That ’ s it . I had to care for them most of the time . __eou__ I see . So if my little family goes to America , I would end up taking care of my child all the time . My husband would have to make the bread for us . I just don ’ t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . You can take night classes . I did that when I had kids . And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . Then you could find a job and work . __eou__ Sounds not so easy to me . When that happens , I will be too old to learn . __eou__ No . You see , I went back to school to get my Master ’ s Degree when I was in my thirties . You won ’ t be older than that . __eou__
Hey , Daniel , how's it going ? __eou__ Hey , Daddy , today I had really a fantastic history class . __eou__ Wow , it's so strange for you to say things like that . What had happened ? __eou__ We've learnt the story of Zheg He Sailing to West Ocean . He is a real great navigator . __eou__ Did your teacher tell you the route he took ? __eou__ Yeah , he , with his fleet , came across the Indian Ocean , and arrived at the east coast of Africa . __eou__ Great , do you still remember when he started his voyage ? __eou__ Of course , that is from 1405 to 1433 , which is in Ming dynasty . __eou__ Good , by the way , do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you ? __eou__ Not yet , you know I have a lot of homework to do . __eou__ You should speed up , because the story of Robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today . __eou__ OK , great Daddy , after supper , I'll embark on it . __eou__ That's my boy ! Wait , Daniel , when is Pirates of the Caribbean on ? __eou__ Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow , who wants to find the treasure on the sea ? __eou__ Exactly , now , tell me the time . __eou__ I won't tell you , unless you promise to let me watch it with you . __eou__
Most of our customers are foreigners . How many foreign languages can you speak , Elizabeth ? __eou__ Two . French and Spanish . __eou__ And how well can you speak them ? __eou__ Well , French was my best subject at school . I can read and write it pretty well . __eou__ And how about your Spanish ? __eou__ Well , it's not as good as my French . I can speak it reasonably well , but my written Spanish isn't very good . __eou__ I see . Well , we have a lot of Spanish customers , but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here . __eou__ In that case , I'm fit for the position I think . __eou__
This historian is famous in the field of Tang Dynasty . __eou__ So he always sits above the salt when there is a seminar about it . __eou__ Right , to be famous to be respectable in some way . __eou__ You got it . __eou__
He has lots of hobbies . __eou__ And he ’ s always busy with his pictures and roses . __eou__ He ’ s won a dozen prizes for his pictures and roses . __eou__ But as for his business in the city ... __eou__ He lets his cousins look after his business . __eou__ He sounds more like an artist than a businessman . __eou__
Good morning , Miss Li . __eou__ Morning , Mike . __eou__ I ’ m sorry that I was absent yesterday . __eou__ I ’ Ve already got your certificate for sick-leave . How do you feel today ? __eou__ I feel much better now . __eou__ Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ? __eou__ I ’ Ve already got it . Thanks . __eou__ I will explain it in detail in the next class . Could you preview it ? __eou__ I will . __eou__
We'd better leave now . __eou__ I beg your pardon ? __eou__
Where are we headed now ? __eou__ To a historic coffeehouse . It's got a little Mafia story to it . __eou__ Awesome . Was someone killed there ? __eou__ Oh , yeah , while he was eating , and he was a pretty famous Don . __eou__ Cool ! Is it safe for us to eat there though ? __eou__ Sure . In fact , nowadays , you'll see more tourists there than Italians . There are Mafia tours nowadays that go there to eat . __eou__
How is everything going with your girlfriend ? __eou__ Didn't I tell you ? It's over ! __eou__ Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did't know that you had split up . What happened ? __eou__ It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up ! __eou__ Really ! Did she tell you why she didn't show up ? __eou__ No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home ! __eou__ What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ? __eou__ I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that the night , but she didn't answer the phone . __eou__ I can't believe she would do that to you . It's so dishonest-and rude ! __eou__ I know . I still haven't heard from her . The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around . __eou__ I bet you that she regrets what she's done . You are such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn't she ? __eou__ I guess so . __eou__ So I don't think you'll have a problem finding another girlfriend . There are plenty of fish in the sea ! __eou__
How do you usually spend your leisure time ? I mean , do you have any special interests out of your job ? __eou__ Of course . You see , almost everyone has some kind of hobby . __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re quite right and what ’ s your hobby ? __eou__ I like taking photos out of doors . __eou__ Oh , photography , It ’ s really a good hobby . __eou__ Yes , I usually develop and print all my own photos . __eou__ You yourself have a photo studio ? __eou__ Yes , simple as it is . It does work . __eou__
Have we handed out all the water ? __eou__ Yes . So what else to do now ? __eou__ Nothing . The teacher said the only thing left was to get back all the disposable cups later . __eou__ I see . How do you like the game ? __eou__ Terrific . There is one girl said , It is the best game I've ever watched . __eou__ Who do you think do better ? __eou__ Clive was really outstanding . Not only he put on a big show himself , but also he inspired the whole team . __eou__ Exactly . He is unbelievable . __eou__ On the other hand , I think the other team won everyone's respect . The leader said they could have crumpled at the beginning , but they just carried on and never lost their cool . __eou__ They were really tough . __eou__ The thing I like most about them is that they did not play with a heavy heart even though at that time the odds seemed to be against them . __eou__ I can't agree more . Okay , time is up . Let's do the last thing . __eou__
I'd like to reserve two seats for tomorrow night . __eou__ Would you like orchestra seats ? __eou__ Isn't there anything less expensive ? __eou__ Not unless you want the matinee . __eou__
Let's do something different today . __eou__ Like how ? __eou__ I would like you to give me a different hair style . __eou__ What did you have in mind ? __eou__ Give me a short haircut . __eou__ Do you know how short you want your hair to be ? __eou__ I want you to cut it to a few inches long . __eou__ That's pretty short . Are you sure about this ? __eou__ I've had this idea for some time now . __eou__ I'm going to do it , but you have to be sure you really want me to . __eou__ This is what I want . __eou__ Fine then . Let's get started . __eou__
We can go to the cinema or say at home watching TV , what's it to be ? __eou__ As far as I'm concerned , staying at home is more comfortable than going to the movies . __eou__ Thanks , dear . I feel so tired after a whole day's work . __eou__
I am thinking about resigning from my current job . __eou__ Have you thought about it seriously ? __eou__ Yes , I have been thinking about it for quite a while . Now I finally make up my mind to leave . I have given my resignation letter to our boss last Friday . __eou__ Ok , did you find a new company ? __eou__ Yes , I will move on to XYZ Company . __eou__ Good for you , but your leaving will be a great loss to us . It is so nice to work with you . __eou__ Thanks . I had learned so much from you and our colleagues . __eou__
Hi , Francis . __eou__ Oh , Mike . How are you doing ? __eou__ Not bad . It seems you are super yogurt lover . You have so many in your cart . __eou__ Well , I prefer yogurt to all the other drinks . Have you ever tried a kind of yogurt with old milk in it ? It tastes great and very healthy too . __eou__ Oh , I haven ’ t noticed that before . Maybe I will try next time . __eou__ Why don ’ t you go ahead of me ? I have more items than you . __eou__ Thank you . In fact , I am in a hurry . My wife is waiting for me at the parking lot . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . It was good seeing you again . __eou__ Me too . Have a great day . __eou__
Hi ! What are you watching ? __eou__ It ’ s a program about islam . It ’ s very interesting . __eou__ Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ? __eou__ They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” . __eou__ Why do they go there ? __eou__ Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith . __eou__ When muslims pray , they face towards mecca . __eou__ That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed . __eou__ I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone . __eou__ That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents . __eou__ Pilgrimages are common in many faiths . __eou__ Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages . __eou__ Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ? __eou__ I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there . __eou__ Do you think that there is something magical about that place ? __eou__ Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way . __eou__
Why do you want to go to the U . S . ? __eou__ I want to enrich my knowledge in management . The United States is an ideal place for me . __eou__ What will you do when you come home ? __eou__ Before I work in the office , I was a teacher . So if possible , I'd like to come back to some school to pass on my new knowledge to more people . __eou__ Do you feel your English is good enough for the course ? __eou__ Yes . You know , English is my present working language . Besides , I scored very high in TOEFL . __eou__ Who will be your supporter during your stay in the States ? __eou__ I will support myself . In recent years , I have saved enough money for my study in the U . S . __eou__ How long do you expect to stay there ? __eou__ I will be there for three years . __eou__
I don't know what to say . This can't be happening . Here's the obituary . __eou__ It's really there ? This all seems so surreal-like it's all one big nightmare . __eou__ But it explains why Taylor isn't answering and Femi took time off from work . __eou__ Poor Femi . Taylor's death must have made her realize that she still cared for him . __eou__ This says the viewing is at Myers Funeral Home today until five . __eou__ It's already half past four . We should go and pay our respects . Taylor's family will be there . __eou__
Dear Anna . I really love you . __eou__ I love you , too . __eou__ I want to take care of you forever . Will you marry me ? __eou__ Oh . My God ! Are you serious ? __eou__ Am I too abrupt ? Did I scare you ? Or you don't want ... __eou__ No ! I have been expecting this moment for a long time . I mean my answer is ' yes ' . __eou__ Oh , I'm so happy . I will try my best to love you and protect you . I promise . __eou__ I trust you . We'll be happy . __eou__ Let me wear you this diamond ring . __eou__ It's so beautiful . __eou__
Balista , pull me a ristretto . __eou__ What ? You're suddenly some kind of coffee snob now ? What's a ristretto anyway ? __eou__ It's basically a very strong espresso . Half the water pulled through the same amount of beans . Pure coffee essence . __eou__ Sounds like it must be just full of caffeine . I want one of those instead ! __eou__ You fiend . It's about the flavor , not the fix . Why don't you just crush some caffeine pills and start doing lines ? __eou__
The Spring Festival is drawing close . By then we will have five days off . I am expecting it . __eou__ Can you tell me something about the Spring Festival ? __eou__ Just like you celebrate Christmas , we celebrate our lunar New Year's Day , the Spring Festival . It is a time for the family members and relatives to have a get-together . __eou__ Christmas is also a special time for us to have the family reunion and to express our best wishes to those we love and those who love us in the coming new year . __eou__ Christmas has more religious nature , while our Spring Festival is a more traditional holiday . On the New Year's Eve , we have a big dinner called ' Family Reunion Dinner ' . One of the traditional food to eat at the dinner is dumplings . After that , the adults usually sit chatting , watching TV , or playing cards . __eou__ What are the children doing ? __eou__ They usually go outside to play firecrackers and fireworks . __eou__ I heard one of the purposes to do it is to frighten the devils so they will not come to do any harm to people in the next year . __eou__ Perhaps it is like what people told you . At 24 hours midnight , the time when the New Year really comes , we exchange ' Happy New Year ' to each other , and parents and grandparents will take out small packages wrapped with red paper , in them are some what we call ' Lucky Money . __eou__ Who will get the money ? __eou__ Of course the children . __eou__
We ’ re going to the movies . Will you join us ? __eou__ I ’ m very sorry I can ’ t . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid I have some business to attend to . __eou__ Then would you like to have lunch with us ? __eou__ I ’ d love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now . __eou__ Would you like me to give you a lift ? __eou__ No , thanks . His home is not far and I can walk there . __eou__ Come on . It ’ s no trouble at all . __eou__ Ok , thank you . __eou__
Bob refused all his classmates ' invitation . __eou__ I really couldn't understand him . __eou__ He is surely a hard nut , nobody likes approaching him . __eou__ We'd better leave him alone . __eou__
Are your ready to go to the supermarket ? __eou__ Yes , are you ? __eou__ I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready . __eou__ You do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you . __eou__ It wasn't cold out this morning . __eou__ Well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there ! __eou__ Well , I guess we'd better grab our umbrellas then , as well . __eou__ Have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ? __eou__ It does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . __eou__ That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . __eou__ Ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here . __eou__ How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? __eou__ I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . __eou__ Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . __eou__ I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? __eou__ Good idea . That will help us to warm up . __eou__ If I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me . __eou__ Alright . I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you . __eou__
At the Beijing Olympics , all four table tennis events were all-Chinese finals . A clean sweep again ! __eou__ Yes . All international ping-pong tournaments have become a demonstration of Chinese supremacy in the sport . __eou__ Do you know any secrets to China's success ? __eou__ In the first place , I think the whole nation is just fond of the game . It is well grounded with the mass . With huge numbers of people playing ping-pong , we can always spot a handful of potential world champions . __eou__ So , the national ping-pong team must be a highly competitive membership . __eou__ Sure . There is a careful mechanism for selecting players from provincial teams , and those lucky dogs have to observe strict rules . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ They are subject to hard training . And you know what , for a player on the national team , personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . They are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other . __eou__ Oh , dear ! It's an encroachment on individual rights ! __eou__ Well , ping-pong is our national sport , and we just have to keep winning one honor after another . That's why many people think such rules acceptable . After all , they are funded out of taxpayers'money . __eou__
I can ’ t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice ! __eou__ Why not ! It ’ s a classic . In fact , it ’ s one of my favorite novels . __eou__ But it ’ s so old . __eou__ Don ’ t judge a book by its cover . Do you Kwon what it ’ s about ? __eou__ No , not at all . __eou__ First of all , it ’ s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century . __eou__ I didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . What ’ s the main storyline ? __eou__ It ’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls . __eou__ Why does he want to do that ? __eou__ Since he doesn ’ t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for . __eou__ Won ’ t they get his inheritance ? __eou__ No , that ’ s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing . __eou__ I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all . __eou__ So , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ? __eou__ There ’ s movie ? My teacher didn ’ t tell me that ! __eou__ That ’ s probably because she wants you to read the book first . __eou__ It would take a lot less time ... __eou__ How about this . When you finish the book . I ’ ll get the movie and watch it with you . __eou__ Ok . That sounds like a deal . __eou__
Hello ! __eou__ Hi , Jenny ! Jason here . It's great to hear your voice again . __eou__ Hi , Jason ! Long time no see . How's the hotel ? __eou__ It's pretty nice , but I'm going to start looking for an apartment soon . Hotel living is not for me . __eou__ I know what you mean . __eou__ How about you ? When are you leaving for Berkeley ? __eou__ I am leaving in two weeks . __eou__ So soon ! Well , I'd really like to see you again before you leave . Would you like to go out with me on Friday ? I'd like to take you to dinner and maybe a movie or something afterwards . __eou__ Oh , I am sorry , Jason . I've already got plans for Friday evening . How about Saturday ? __eou__ Saturday is fine . I'll make dinner reservations for 7 o ’ clock . Is that ok ? __eou__ 7 is fine with me . __eou__ Great . I'll pick you up at six thirty . __eou__ I'll be waiting . __eou__
When do you want to have the open house party ? __eou__ How about next Friday ? __eou__ Friday sounds good . __eou__ How do you feel about hiring that clown to come and entertain the kids ? __eou__ I like that . Then the adults will be more free to mingle and relax . __eou__ That's what I was thinking . __eou__ I'm so excited . Finally , a yard of my own . __eou__ Do you feel like a king in your castle ? __eou__
Dad , I'm scared . __eou__ Take it easy , honey . It's just raining cats and dogs . __eou__ But , dad , it's stormy outside . __eou__ Honey , it's just windy and raining outside . __eou__ Ar ! Dad , the power went out . __eou__
I'm so glad that the spring festival is near at hand . __eou__ me . too i like the festival best of all . __eou__ Think of the big face down the eve , hmm . __eou__ And special TV programs , fire crackers and the games to play . __eou__ Hey , do you know any mystery belief serve the festival ? __eou__ Such as ... __eou__ You know why fire crackers are set off in festival . __eou__ Why ? to welcome the new year of course . __eou__ And also to frighten away evil spirits . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ And my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year . __eou__ Oh , that's why my parents never scold me that day . they always try to avoid tears and quarrels . __eou__
Mary likes mountain climbing . __eou__ What ? No kidding ! __eou__ Yes , she's a professional climber . __eou__ I can't believe it ! __eou__
You must be feeling terrible for Mary . __eou__ Yes , she's been like this for two weeks . __eou__ I'm worried that she can't catch up with her class . __eou__ So am I.The doctor says she'll get over in a month . __eou__
You wouldn't believe what I got in the mail today ! __eou__ what's that ? __eou__ it's a letter from Ray and Sue in Shanghai ! __eou__ have you read it yet ? __eou__ no , I thought I'd wait until you got home . __eou__ go on , read it out loud . __eou__ ok . It says , " Dear Jessica . It was so good to receive you letter . I sounds like you and Riley are settling into your new home with ease ... " __eou__ when did you send her a letter ? __eou__ just a few weeks ago . Sue and I send letters to each other often . __eou__ I didn't know anyone did that any more . Ok , go on . __eou__ ok ... I'm going to have to skip over this section . It's girl-talk . __eou__ that's fine with me . __eou__ oh . It's actually all rather personal . __eou__ well , skip over all of that and read me the rest . __eou__ ok , it just says , ball , blah , blah ... " Ray and I look forward to seeing you in June . Write soon . With love , Sue . " __eou__ are we going to see them in June or are they coming to see us ? __eou__ didn't I tell you ? We're going to Shanghai to stay with them in June . __eou__ oh , I guess I missed that . __eou__ men ! __eou__
Jack , what do you think about the election ? __eou__ I think the campaign is a blockbuster . __eou__ How many people have flung their hats into the ring ? __eou__ Finally 100 candidates ran for one seat . __eou__ Who do you think will be elected ? __eou__ It's hard to say . They all had an active campaign to round up the votes . __eou__ I think Mr . White would be elected , you know he has spent millions in this campaign and he blasted the opposition in his campaign speech . __eou__ Maybe . Who knows ? __eou__
May doesn't get along very well with her mother-in-law . __eou__ Yeah . That's just what is troubling John . __eou__ Poor John ! He is bettering bother sides of this bread . __eou__ This situation isn't easy to handle . __eou__
Can you tell me the time ? I've got an appointment at 8: 30 . __eou__ It's 8 sharp by my watch . __eou__ Gee ! There's only thirty minutes to go . __eou__
Holly , I just heard some terrible news . __eou__ Me , too . I overheard someone say Taylor has a brain tumor . __eou__ What ? No , I heard that he has stomach cancer . His ex-girlfriend said it . __eou__ That could explain all his stomachaches . He's trying to hide it from us . __eou__ Maybe that's why he didn't show up at the potluck . Have you seen him ? __eou__ No , but someone said he was in the men's room puking . Follow me ! __eou__
Hi , Kate . __eou__ Hi , Don . What a surprise ! __eou__ Yeah , I saw someone walking like you , but I wasn ’ t sure . We haven ’ t seen each other for how long ? Almost three months ? But you look quite different now . __eou__ Have you noticed what has changed ? __eou__ Oh , you look quite slender and more vivacious . What have you been taking ? Are you on a diet ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ m on a diet , but I ’ Ve not taken anything . I just eat less and exercise more . And it really worked in the past three months . I ’ Ve lost twelve pounds . __eou__ Wow ! That ’ s great . I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals , but it ’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . Also you know , old habits are hard to break . __eou__ What kind of exercise do you think I do ? I just go to dance everyday after work . I ’ m taking an amateur dance class . I dance two hours everyday . __eou__ Dance ? You only go dancing ? That ’ s not hard . I can do that . __eou__ Sure . Join my class next week . __eou__
What food do you fancy ? __eou__ I feel like something good to eat . __eou__ How about going to Joe's Restaurant . __eou__ Hey , that sounds a good idea . __eou__
Hello , Jack.It ' s good of you to come . __eou__ The pleasure is mine.Happy birthday and many happy returns of the day ! __eou__ Thank you , Jack.To be frank , I'd rather forget my birthday . __eou__ Don't be silly . __eou__
Sam , we are hard up for the everyday expenses . When can you find a job . __eou__ I'm looking for it , but you see , the market is hard up for jobs , too . __eou__ You liar , I saw you again in the inn . I bet you don't want to work at all . __eou__
I'm sorry , but I can't find the book you lent me . I guess I have lost it . __eou__ Don't worry about it . __eou__ I really feel bad about it . Let me buy you a new one . __eou__ No . Don't be silly . I wouldn't dream of letting you do that . __eou__
What's your favorite magazine ? __eou__ Off hand , I'd say the Reader's Digests is my favorite . __eou__ What kind of magazine is it ? __eou__ It's instructive and inspiring . __eou__ Really ? It is a weekly , isn't it ? __eou__ No , it's a semimonthly . __eou__ Does it enjoy popularity among the young generation ? __eou__ Yes , it's so popular that it's sold out as soon as it reaches the bookstores . __eou__ Oh , I think I should try to read one . __eou__
Hello ? Is that Mark ? __eou__ How are you ? I haven't heard from you in ages . __eou__ I've been overseas , So have you been busy lately ? __eou__ Pretty busy.So are you back for good ? __eou__ Yes , I was just wondering when you'd have time to go fishing . __eou__ Well , I'm not working on the weekend , so we could grab some beer , ice and our fishing rods , and head out to the river . __eou__ That sounds good . I've missed you my friend . __eou__ Same here . __eou__
Thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . Is that common ? __eou__ Well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows . __eou__ Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn't look like real rice to me . __eou__ It wasn't . It was birdseed . We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it . __eou__ Oh , I didn't think of that . Well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China . Plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions . __eou__ Wait until you see what happens next ! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . Let's go over and watch . __eou__ She ’ s got quite a crowd around her . Oh , look ! That little girl caught it ! __eou__ She ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece . I guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time . __eou__
We are doing ' Secret Santa ' at the office again this year . __eou__ Whose name did you pick ? __eou__ I got Jacob . Any ideas what to get him ? __eou__ Booze ! __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re right . Can ’ t go wrong with that . __eou__
So , Monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ? __eou__ Actually , I had a perfect plan for this afternoon , but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . I woke up this morning and found it was sunny . So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . We were going to look for a new purse . Now it turned out to be like this . Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore . __eou__ That ’ s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ’ t people do something to stop it ? __eou__ It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course , it will not work overnight . So , have you come out with a new plan for today ? __eou__ My new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment . __eou__
Hey ! What's up ? __eou__ Hi , John ! I haven't seen you for ages . __eou__ Yeah , I've been out of town . __eou__ So how have you been ? __eou__ Great ! Work is really busy now , but it's fun . __eou__
Bob refused all his classmates ' invitations . __eou__ I really couldn't understand him . __eou__ He is surely a hard nut , nobody likes approaching him . __eou__ We'd better also leave him alone . __eou__
Hey , Paul , why the long face ? __eou__ It's difficult to explain . __eou__ Try me . __eou__ Well , I had a terrible day of work , I'm thinking of quiting my job . __eou__ Take it easy , maybe tomorrow will be different . __eou__ I don't know , I can't stand my job these days . __eou__ Cheer up , I hope you'll feel better soon . __eou__
I give up ! I simply can't learn French ! __eou__ Why do you say that ? I think you're making a lot of progress . __eou__ No , I'm not . I try and try and I still can't speak it very well . __eou__ Learning any language takes a lot of effort . But don't give up . Why don't we practise those dialogues together ? __eou__ Good idea . That might help . __eou__
Would you like to go to a party tonight ? __eou__ That sounds like a good idea . __eou__ Would 7:00 be OK ? __eou__ That's fine . I'm looking forward to it . __eou__
Hello , I'm Jack . Are you Christina ? __eou__ Yes I am . Nice to meet you , Jack . __eou__ Are you from Italy , Christina ? __eou__ No , I am German . I live in Munich . __eou__ Really , I went to Munich last week . __eou__ And did you like it ? __eou__ Oh , yes . It is a fantastic city . And I like German food as well . __eou__ And where are you from , Jack ? __eou__ I am from California in the United States . But I am now studying in England . __eou__ What are you studying ? __eou__ I am studying languages . This year I am doing German and Italian . __eou__ Oh , excellent . Why don't we talk in German for a while then ? __eou__
hi , Charlie ! What are you reading ? __eou__ hi , bob . I ’ m reading a biography ? __eou__ who ’ s it about ? __eou__ it ’ s about bob Dylan . __eou__ who is he ? __eou__ he ’ s a famous American musician . __eou__ who ’ s the author ? __eou__ it was written by Howard sounds . __eou__ what do you think about it ? __eou__ it ’ s great ! I ’ Ve learned a lot form reading it . __eou__ can I read it when you ’ re done ? __eou__ sure , bob ! I ’ m on chapter 12 now , so I ’ m almost finished . __eou__ how many chapters does the book have ? __eou__ there are 15 chapters in total . __eou__ when do you think you ’ ll have finished reading it ? __eou__ I should be done by Friday . I ’ ll give it to you in class then . __eou__ thanks . Charlie ! __eou__ no problem . Bob . __eou__
Whip me if I get below 80 marks out of 100 ! __eou__ Take it easy , Jim . Your mother didn't mean it ! Need any help ? __eou__ Yes . Can you help me remember how to spell ' beautiful ' ? __eou__
Where are you planning on transferring to ? __eou__ I can ’ t seem to make a decision . __eou__ Where do you want to go ? __eou__ I honestly have no idea . __eou__ You haven ’ t thought about it ? __eou__ I like it here at PCC . __eou__ Why don ’ t you just continue going to PCC ? __eou__ I like that idea . __eou__ It ’ s a great school . __eou__ I completely agree . __eou__ So , have you made your decision yet ? __eou__ I ’ m staying right where I ’ m at . __eou__
Any plans tonight ? __eou__ Not really , do you ? __eou__ Well , I am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something . You know , I just came back from a really tough interview . I was quite nervous during the interview . I really want to have the job . Right now , I am still a little on the edge . I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview . __eou__ Take it easy . It is all over now . How was it going , anyway ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . I think I did well in the paper exams . I was prepared to answer a lot of questions , but they didn ’ t ask those as I expected . To my surprise , the manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me . __eou__ That ’ s strange . But probably , it is the new interview technique they call it “ Getting to know you more personally ” . What about your answers ? __eou__ Just did my best . __eou__
Mary , how was your date with john ? __eou__ It's ok . It seems we have a lot in common . __eou__ Oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ? __eou__ He is tall and slim , fair-haired . __eou__ Sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? __eou__ He is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . __eou__ Oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ? __eou__ He didn't say , but he said he would call me . __eou__ Maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much ! __eou__ Oh , steve . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What if he doesn't call ? __eou__ Come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry . __eou__ Thank you , Steve . You're always so encouraging . __eou__ That's what friends are for . __eou__
In my opinions , someone else has caused the fire of this house . __eou__ Who do you think that has the motive ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure now . In any case , let ’ s first make some careful investigations . __eou__ OK , murder will out ! __eou__ Yeah . __eou__
So Dick , how about getting some coffee for tonight ? __eou__ Coffee ? I don ’ t honestly like that kind of stuff . __eou__ Come on , you can at least try a little , besides your cigarette . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for . __eou__ Not for me , Dick . __eou__
Thank you for your hospitality , Leon . I had a wonderful time ! __eou__ You're welcome , Diane . I hope you can visit us again soon . __eou__
David , why didn ’ t you clean the room ? __eou__ I ’ m not in the mood . __eou__ Why are you feeling depressed ? __eou__ I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down . __eou__ I don ’ t think she will do such a thing . __eou__ But she did and made me disappointed . __eou__ Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything . __eou__ But she means a lot to me . __eou__ Then forgive her mistake . __eou__ Oh . I just can ’ t forget it . __eou__
Which university did you graduate from ? __eou__ I graduated from Songhua University . __eou__ When did you graduate ? __eou__ I graduated from it in 2002 . __eou__
You are friend of Janet , right ? I am Andrew , Andrew Smith . __eou__ Nice to meet you , Andrew . I am Noirin , Noirin O'Neil . __eou__ I'm sorry , I didn't quite catch that . __eou__ Noirin , N-O-I-R-I-N , it's an Irish name . __eou__
Would you like a cigarette ? __eou__ No , thanks . I've decided to give up smoking . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ Well , it's just that I think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it . __eou__ I see . You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ? __eou__ That's right . You should give it up , too . It's bad for your health . __eou__ Stop talking like my mother . That's what she keeps saying . __eou__ But it's true . It's a nasty habit . I can't think why I ever started . Anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip ! __eou__ What do you mean ? What are you talking about ? __eou__ I mean you couldn't give it up ! __eou__ Who ? Me ? Could't give up smoking ? Nonsense ! Of course I could ! I know I could ! __eou__ How do you know ? __eou__ Because I've already proved it . Smoking's the easiest thing in the world to give up . I've done it hundreds of times ! __eou__
Do you think Mr . Johnson is a good worker ? __eou__ Just between you and me , I think he's lazy . __eou__ Haven't you ever seen him working late ? __eou__ No , I haven't . __eou__
What do you think of smoking ? __eou__ It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others . __eou__ What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? __eou__ Stop producing cigarettes . __eou__ But that ’ ll affect the national economy . __eou__ That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways . __eou__ How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet ? __eou__ Maybe it can take effect . __eou__
I'm here to express my congratulations to you on your birthday . And I wish you many happy returns of the day . Here is a birthday present for you . __eou__ Many thanks for your presence . __eou__
How did you spend the weekend ? __eou__ I went to a movie with my boyfriend . __eou__ Really ? How was it ? __eou__ It was great . The director took a lot of care while framing . They say be has good chance at winning the Oscar for best director . Also I like the actors , some really great new young actors . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? What's it about ? __eou__ Well , it's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds . But besides a beautiful story , the cinematography is great . There is some really dramatic footage . It's really quite a visual feast . And the soundtrack is moving . __eou__ Sounds pretty good . Is it a tragedy ? __eou__ The ending is a bit of a surprise . I don't want to ruin it for you . __eou__ Oh , I like movies with surprise endings , although , sometimes they can be frustrating . Maybe I should invite my girlfriend to go next weekend . __eou__ It would be a really good choice . The movie is very suitable for lovers to see together . I'm sure you won't regret it . __eou__
Would you like to come out with me tonight ? __eou__ Sorry , I can ’ t . __eou__ Tomorrow night , then ? __eou__ I ’ d like to . But I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . __eou__ I ’ m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then . __eou__ That ’ s sounds great . __eou__ Ok . How about give me a ring , then ? __eou__ No . I ’ d better not . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Because I don ’ t think my husband would like it . Thank you for inviting me anyway . __eou__
My goodness ! You ’ re kidding ! __eou__ No . I ’ m serious . I ’ m going to quit my job . __eou__ That ’ s amazing ! You got a good pay here , didn ’ t you ? __eou__ It ’ s true . But I can ’ t show my abilities . __eou__ Come on ! Don ’ t be silly ! __eou__ Your present job is something better . Why do you change ? __eou__ Well . How do you know ? __eou__
All of my friends are going out to the lake tonight and I'm going too ! __eou__ Over my dead body you are ! __eou__
Hello , Anna speaking ! __eou__ Hey , Anna , this is Jason . __eou__ Jason , where have you been hiding lately ? You know it's been a long time since your last call . Have you been good ? __eou__ Yes . How are you , Anna ? __eou__ I am fine . What have you been doing ? __eou__ Working . I've been really busy these days . I got a promotion . __eou__ That's great , congratulations ! __eou__ Thanks . I am feeling pretty good about myself too . You know , bigger office , a raise and even an assistant . __eou__ That's good . So I guess I'll have to make an appointment to see you . __eou__ You are kidding . __eou__ How long have you been working there ? __eou__ A bit over two years . This is a fast-moving company , and seniority isn ’ t the only factor in deciding promotions . __eou__ How do you like your new boss ? __eou__ She is very nice and open-minded . __eou__ Much better than the last one , huh ? __eou__ Yeah . He was a real slave driver . He probably would have loved it if we were robots . __eou__ Forget about him . Come over to my house tonight . Let's get drunk . __eou__ Good . Tonight 8 o'clock . __eou__ 8 it is . See you then . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
Shall we go to a movie tonight ? __eou__ That's a good idea.What ' s on ? __eou__ Gone with the Wind . __eou__ What's it about ? __eou__ Sorry , I've no idea . __eou__
I never understand why these shops have so much liquor . __eou__ What do you mean ? It's because it's much cheaper to buy liquor duty-free . __eou__ But why ? Why don't people like to buy shirts duty-free ? Or shoes ? I just don't understand why it's always liquor . __eou__ Well , it's because in most countries liquor has a higher tax on it . __eou__ You mean liquor has a higher tax than other things ? __eou__ Yes , of course . Didn't you know that ? __eou__ No , I didn't . How high is the tax ? __eou__ Well , it is different in different countries.But it's because of the high tax that buying liquor duty-free is such a good deal . __eou__ Why would the government want to tax liquor so much ? __eou__ Liquor is considered a luxury item.And also , it is considered as something that isn't very healthy.So if people want to buy it , the government thinks it has the right to tax it . __eou__ That's why a lot of people buy cigarettes here too , isn't it ? __eou__ Of course . Cigarettes are also taxed very heavily . __eou__
What do you plan to do on Sunday morning ? __eou__ Nothing special . __eou__ How about going to English corner with me ? __eou__ Oh , I'd rather not . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ You know , I am poor at English , especially spoken English . __eou__ That's why you should go there , If you don't dare to speak English owing to the fact that you are afraid of making mistakes , you simply will never learn English . __eou__
Why are you walking to and fro in the room ? __eou__ I ’ m worrying about the children . After all this is the first time they have been out without us . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . They are grown-ups . __eou__ I know . But I couldn ’ t help . __eou__
Mary , why don't you come to my house this Saturday ? __eou__ I don't know . I'll have to ask my host mom . __eou__ Come on , Mary . This is America . You make your own decisions here . __eou__ But I still have to tell her . __eou__ Of course . __eou__ Tell you what , give me your phone number . __eou__ It's 555-4321 . __eou__ Got it . I'll call you later tonight and we can talk about what to do on Saturday . __eou__
They must be your parents , what do they do ? __eou__ My mother is a professor and my father is a manager . __eou__ Do they often take you out ? __eou__ No , usually they're very busy . __eou__
I went to the doctor yesterday . __eou__ I beg your pardon ? __eou__ I said I had been to the doctor the day before . __eou__ What did he say ? __eou__ He said I ' d got the flu . __eou__ Oh dear ! What did he tell you to do ? __eou__ He told me to stay in bed for ten days . __eou__ Ten days ? Would you please repeat it again ? __eou__ Yes , ten days . __eou__
Have a nice weekend . __eou__ Same to you . __eou__
It seems to be clearing up . __eou__ It's such a nice change . __eou__ I really don't think this weather will last . __eou__ Let's just hope it doesn't get cold again . __eou__
There's a new play tonight . __eou__ What's its name ? __eou__ ' Romeo and Juliet ' . __eou__ What is it about ? __eou__ It's about their great love . __eou__ Sounds interesting . __eou__ Of course .

Hey John , did you register for classes yet ? __eou__ I register this Friday . __eou__ What classes do you plan on taking ? __eou__ I really want to take the communication class , but I don't know if it will be available . __eou__ Is that class really that popular ? __eou__ Yeah . I tried to get in last semester , but it was full by the time I registered . __eou__ What other classes are you going to take ? __eou__ I still need to take English 201 , but I really don't like writing . __eou__ I took that class already . There is a lot of writing , but it's not that bad . __eou__ Oh really ? Who was the instructor ? There are like 4 different instructors to choose from . __eou__ I had Professor Mahoney . __eou__ Is he an easy grader ? __eou__ I'm not sure if he is or not , but I thought he was definitely fair . __eou__ Do you mind if I ask you what you got ? __eou__ Not at all . I got a 3.8 . __eou__ Well , what did you get in English 101 last year ? __eou__ I got a 4.0 in that class . __eou__ Well , I can't compare to you . I got a 3.1 in English 101 . That means if you got a lower grade in English 201 , it must be harder . __eou__ It's not what it appears . I actually tried harder in the 101 class . If I put as much effort into the 201 class , I would have received the same grade . __eou__ Oh . That helps . Thanks . __eou__
Mr . Smith is really a thorough drag . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ He's endless talking about stocks almost bores me to death . __eou__ Don't you like to know anything about stocks ? __eou__ I'm not at all keen on this subject . __eou__

School has added several new courses to our grade this semester . I have more homework to do now . __eou__ What's your favorite course , Daniel ? __eou__ I like science most . __eou__ Science ? That's a surprise . __eou__ Surprise ? __eou__ I thought you would like PE . __eou__ I do like PE , but I am interested in science . __eou__ Are you interested in science ? I can't believe it . __eou__ Through this course , I can learn more about the world around us clearly . __eou__ Your parents would be happy if they knew that .

I ’ ll go there right now and speak with the boss . __eou__ There ’ s no rush . You can see him tomorrow . I ’ Ve told him about you . He promised to give you the job . __eou__ That was nice of you , Susan . Thanks a lot . __eou__ Think nothing of it , Tony . I ’ m sure you ’ d do the same for me . __eou__ Could you tell me a bit more about the work there ? I mean , those dos and don'ts . I am a green hand , you know . __eou__ First of all , you must be punctual . You should be there before 6 p . m . so that you will have half an hour for preparation changing clothes and things like that . Then , remember you should smile . Smile to your customers all the time . Never pull a long face even If you feel awful that day . Anything else ? Oh , yes . Never argue with your boss . Learn to say ' Yes , sir . ' __eou__ Be a yes-man , you mean ? __eou__ You may put it that way if you like . Don ’ t worry . You ’ ll have no problem . __eou__ I hope not . __eou__

Tom , I married Julia last month . Have you already known it ? __eou__ No , I haven't . I'm so surprised at the news . __eou__ Indeed , we got married too soon . __eou__ Congratulations . But have you heard the proverb that if one gets married too hurriedly one may regret it for a long time ? __eou__ Yes . However , I believe that marriage comes by destiny . I knew I would marry Julia when I met her at the first time . __eou__ How's your married life ? __eou__ We're happy together now . __eou__ I have to say you're a well-matched couple . __eou__ Thank you ! __eou__
What did you learn at the workshop you went to yesterday ? Do you think it was worth the investment to go ? __eou__ Yeah , I really got a lot of the session . The workshop topic was resolving personal problems . It was led by a professional human resources director . The teacher had a lot of experience , and I think we were all given a really good base to start with . __eou__ The workshop was only one afternoon long , do you really think you can learn that much in only a couple of hours ? __eou__ It depends on the topic , the teacher , and the way the course is set up . Yesterday , even though we only had a short time to discuss the issues , the workshop got us all thinking . We learned some very basic , but very useful methods of dealing with personnel issues . __eou__ Sounds like you really learned a lot . __eou__ I did ... I just hope I can implement all these great ideas that we shared . __eou__
Every teacher likes him . __eou__ They say he can sum up like winking . __eou__ How he manages to do that is always a mystery to me . __eou__ Maybe he's gifted in that . __eou__
There's just one catch . Zina asked me to let you know . __eou__ What ? __eou__ She promised that we'd be ready to start tracking the Stars.com web site by the end of next week . __eou__ What ! ? It'll be a miracle if we're ready by the end of the month ! Is she crazy ? __eou__ Yes , I think she is just a little bit crazy . __eou__ Crazy is too kind . Insane is more like it . Nuts ! Wacko ! Psycho ! __eou__
Would you like to have some more wine ? __eou__ Sure.thanks . __eou__ Say when . __eou__
I ’ m terribly sorry to cause you so much trouble . __eou__ That ’ s alright . __eou__

What sport do you like the most ? __eou__ I like baseball the best . __eou__ Me too . Did you play when you were a kid ? __eou__ Yeah . I played until I graduated from high school . __eou__ What position did you play ? __eou__ I think I tried every position , but the last few years , I played third base . __eou__ I hate third base . It's scary when the ball is coming at you so fast . __eou__ It was scary at first , but after awhile , I got used to it . If you have fast reflexes , then it's not really a problem . What position did you play ? __eou__ I played outfield . I hated the infield because I never figured out all the bounces . __eou__ I wish I could play again , but there isn't much opportunities around here . __eou__ I'm on a softball league . It's not fast pitch , but it's still fun . You wanna join our group ? __eou__ When do you guys play ? __eou__ We play either Tuesdays or Thursdays . __eou__ Sounds pretty fun . I'll come out and join you next time . __eou__
Jane's mother always wants her to marry a big shot . J __eou__ That is just wishful thinking . The cost of higher education has increased in recent years , faster than the cost of living . So she wants Jane's brother to go on studying and earn his doctorate by means of it . __eou__ But it's unfair for Jane . __eou__
I'm back . __eou__ What have you done ? __eou__ Going shopping . It tires me too much . __eou__ Why don't you go shopping online ? __eou__ Can I ? __eou__ Why not ? Let me recommend a website . __eou__ OK . What does it sell ? __eou__ It sells almost everything you can see in the department . __eou__ That's great . __eou__
Hey Nick , what are you up to ? __eou__ Not much , just heading over to the shooting range . You wanna come ? __eou__ Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ’ t know man . __eou__ Yeah , it will be fun ! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . I also have a revolver that ’ s really fun too ! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you __eou__ Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower ! __eou__ Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ’ t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be __eou__ Wow , I didn ’ t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies ! __eou__ The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ? __eou__ Let ’ s do it ! __eou__
I went out with Leo last night . It was really exciting . __eou__ Really ? You are a lucky dog . You know , many girls dream of dating him . __eou__ Yes , I know . He's really on the A-list . __eou__
What kind of note are you taking there . That looks like doodle to me . __eou__ It's picture association of the concept that the professor taught today . __eou__ Does that actually work for you ? __eou__ I don't really know for sure yet . I'll tell you after the test on Friday . __eou__ I like to use shorthand note taking . __eou__ I was told once that the more time you spend writing , the less you are paying attention and so you miss stuff . __eou__ Hmm . I never thought about it that way . __eou__ One time I tried just listening , no notes , no pictures . I think I really learned more that day . __eou__
I heard that ben is forming his own band . __eou__ It will be a rock and roll band probably . He ’ s a very good guitarist . __eou__ Can you play a musical instrument ? If you can , he might ask you to join the band . __eou__ I can play drums , but I haven ’ t played for a while . I ’ m not sure I ’ d be good enough to play in a band . __eou__ I wish I could play a musical instrument . I love music . __eou__ Nowadays , you can be a DJ . You can mix dance music . You don't need to be able to play music instrument or thing . __eou__ I love to try it , but the instrument is expensive and it was still need to take a lot of practice . __eou__ You know , you could probably get a computer program that would help you . You already have a computer , so you could use that to help you mix some music . __eou__ That ’ s a great idea . I ’ ll search for some information on the internet . If it ’ s possible to do , the internet will have some information about it . __eou__
It's one of the highlights of the match . __eou__ What ? __eou__ The wonderful passing Melaena did . __eou__ Too bad I missed it . __eou__
Susan has been down recently . I saw her this morning , she looked terrible ! __eou__ You have any idea why ? __eou__ She broke up with her boyfriend . __eou__ I heard her boyfriend is married . __eou__ She still loves him . That's why she feels upset . Her love is always hard and confusing ... __eou__ Then what about you ? How are you getting on with your boyfriend ? __eou__ He sometimes really drives me crazy . __eou__
Your tree looks beautiful . Do you decorate it this way every year ? __eou__ Yes , it's a family tradition dating back to my childhood . We use the same lights and ornaments , but of course we have a new tree each year.The children made some of these decorations . Here , you can hang this on one of those high branches . __eou__ Well , everything seems to be just about ready . Now all we need is snow.Do you exchange the presents in the morning ? __eou__ Oh , yes . The kids are too excited to wait . After we clean up the mess all the empty boxes and the wrapping paper we have a big breakfast . Then the kids have the whole day to play with their new toys . __eou__ And we'll have a great turkey dinner at around four o'clock . My brother and his family will be joining us . I look forward to meeting them . Well , it's late , so I'll say good night . I'll see you early tomorrow , so I can share your Christmas morning.Good night ! __eou__
Has your family lived here for long ? __eou__ Five and a half years . We moved here on the first of November . __eou__ You have a fantastic view . __eou__ Yes . I love living here . __eou__ Look ! You can see the village way down in the valley . __eou__ Yes . It ’ s a lovely view . __eou__
Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ? __eou__ yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day . __eou__ good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time . __eou__ yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ... __eou__ is everything ready now ? __eou__ almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive . __eou__ have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job . __eou__ yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet . __eou__ it's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . __eou__ that's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ’ t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception . __eou__ I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels .

But I go skiing so often that I don't get excited anymore . __eou__ I only go skiing twice a year , so it's a real treat for me . __eou__ That makes sense . __eou__ What things make you excited ? __eou__ Whenever I go to Vegas , I get really excited . __eou__ Oh ... that makes me excited too ! __eou__ Looks like anything fun makes you excited . __eou__

This is what I want . __eou__

Japanese is easy to learn . __eou__ You're mistaken about it . As a matter of fact , it's very hard . __eou__ I don't think so.There ' re so many familiar characters and they sound just like Chinese . __eou__ You're quite right.But many Japanese learners begin with smiles on their faces and end up with tears in their eyes . __eou__

It'll connect hundreds of millions of customers and open up huge markets for all kinds of products and services . __eou__ That's true . I can imagine companies sending advertisements directly to customers over the net . Customers , in turn , can examine and compare whatever goods they want to buy and tell their computers to find them at the best price offered . __eou__ Yeah . It'll be a shoppers heaven . That's the use of net in E-commerce . __eou__

I wasn ’ t looking for a holiday romance , but my sister told me that she had promised him that she ’ d set him up on blind date with me . I didn ’ t think I ’ d have anything to lose , so I went . __eou__ And ? __eou__ Let ’ s just say that by the third date , we both realized that we had fallen in love . __eou__ That happened quickly ! Are you going to see him again ? __eou__ Luckily , his company has a position available here , so he ’ s going to see if he can get relocated . __eou__ It sounds like he is madly in love with you .

There ’ s a possibility of getting a job with a law firm in London , provide __eou__ we both have to overcome several obstacles if we are to achieve our ambitions . __eou__ if life were easy , then we ’ d achieve our ambition quickly and then get bored . __eou__ unfortunately , it ’ s inevitable that some people are going to work hard yet not succeed . __eou__ that ’ s why ambition need to be realistic . You can ’ t achieve something that ’ s totally unrealistic . __eou__ as long as you plan carefully , most thing are possible . It ’ s always good to have a backup plan in case things go wrong . __eou__ I think it ’ s important to be successful in a field you are truly interested in , not something that other people force you to be interested it . __eou__ my father wanted me to become a doctor , but I knew it would be impossible for me to be successful in that field . __eou__ I hope my parents don ’ t try to interfere in my choice of career . __eou__

Why don ’ t you come with me tonight ? __eou__ Really ? Thanks . I ’ ll stop by when I get off work . __eou__ Perfect . See you later . __eou__ O . K . , see you . __eou__
Do you like traveling ? __eou__ Yes , I've just come back from Scotland . __eou__ Where did you visit ? __eou__ I only had time to visit Edinburgh . __eou__ How did you like it ? __eou__ It's fantastic . __eou__ Why did you go there ? __eou__ I went there on business . __eou__ And do you have friends there ? __eou__ Yes , a lot of friends . __eou__ You must have enjoyed yourself . __eou__ Yes , and I look many pictures . __eou__
Susan , Did you know the four ugliest women in ancient China ? __eou__ No , I only know four great beauties of China . __eou__ There were some famous ugly women in history . __eou__ Yeah ? Were they famous because of the ugliness ? __eou__ Though they were ugly , they had great virtue . __eou__ Then who were they ? __eou__ Mo Mu , Thong Lichen , Meng Gang and Ran Nv . They were well respected . __eou__ It seems that the inner beauty is also important . __eou__ Sometimes the inner beauty is more beautiful . __eou__
I wonder how Sarah and Mat are . __eou__ Don't you know they've already broken up ? __eou__ I'm not surprised . She's a plain Jane . __eou__ And he's so handsome . __eou__

Nowadays , ships and boats are no longer so important in transportation as they used to be . __eou__ True . With the extension of railways and highways , and the improvement of safety and capacity of airplanes , ships and boats have been giving place to trains , planes and automobiles . __eou__ I read in the newspapers that the passenger liners from Shanghai to Ningpo and Dalian have been out of business ; and the liners up and down the Yangtze River have been reduced by 70 % . __eou__ The pace of life of people is now getting faster and faster , so the speed of ships and boats seems to be so slow . I think it may be the reason why people don't like to travel by boat . __eou__ But the most of the transoceanic cargo transportation is still carried by boat . __eou__
I always think everybody looks down on me __eou__ Don't be that negative . __eou__ How can you be optimistic ? You can see it in their eyes . __eou__ I find it there is no meaning in living this world . __eou__ Don't be that negative . __eou__ Really , life is so boring . __eou__

To welcome the new year of course ? __eou__ And also to frighten away evil spirits . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ And my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year . __eou__ Oh , that's why my parents never scold me that day . They always try to avoid tears and quarrels . __eou__
Mom , did you feel the earthquake this afternoon ? __eou__ Oh , that scared me . __eou__ The breaking news just reported some houses were destroyed by the earthquake . __eou__ Oh , dear ! How ruthless ! __eou__ Do you think we can donate some clothes and food for the victims ? __eou__ Why not ? That's a good idea to help them . __eou__
It's really late but I'm starving . __eou__ Hey , that coffee shop's lights are still on . __eou__ Maybe they have some good pie . __eou__ I would love a really sticky cinnamon bun . __eou__ There was a coffee shop by my house when I was a kid that served cinnamon hot chocolate . __eou__ Mmmm . That sounds like something I had in Mexico once . __eou__ Good stuff ... Oh , no . The door is locked . __eou__ Ohhhhh ! And I just got all my juices going ! __eou__
How have you been ? __eou__ Fine , thank you . __eou__ And how ’ s everyone in your family ? __eou__ Very well , thank you . I ’ m meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at 12:00 , would you care to join us ? __eou__ I ’ d love to but I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . I ’ Ve already got a lunch engagement . __eou__
How was your first date , David ? Are you satisfied with Jane ? __eou__ It was all right . She , tall and attractive , has stable job and source of income . __eou__ Yes , so I think she is suitable for you . __eou__ But , well ... what I want to say is ... __eou__ Stop acting like this . Say away ! __eou__ Her standard for selecting life partner is a little higher . I can not accept that . __eou__ What did she say ? __eou__ She said she want a man with large house , luxurious car and healthy parents . __eou__ Give her up . __eou__
I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there he is . __eou__ hey , Isabelle ... __eou__ Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . __eou__ yes , I am the guy . __eou__ what a bummer ! You set me up ? __eou__ let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... __eou__ how dare you ! __eou__ hang on a second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella ! __eou__ why did you lie to me in the email ? __eou__ I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name . __eou__ I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me . __eou__ I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over . __eou__

I love that vase . __eou__ Do you really like it ? __eou__ Yes , it looks perfect . __eou__ It wasn't very expensive either . __eou__ That's amazing ! __eou__
In my country , we go to school from 8 o'clock in the morning until five in the afternoon . __eou__ Five days a week , too ? __eou__ Actually , five and a half . On Saturday , we have classes only in the morning . __eou__ Gosh ! __eou__ That's too much for us really . __eou__ Where are you going now ? __eou__ I'm going to try to find out where the school is located . __eou__ When do you start school ? __eou__ I'm going to register right now . __eou__ That's good . __eou__

The days are longer in summer that in winter , so I get up in summer .

How do you spend your mornings ? __eou__ I usually do housework in mornings . I go shopping occasionally . I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket . I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center . It takes about __eou__ how do you spend your afternoons ? __eou__ I usually meet some friends and we play sports together or I might spend some time alone on my hobbies . I spend winter evening watching tv , but I spend summer evening at cultural events if I have time __eou__
Hi , my name is Ted , what ’ s yours ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ I said , I ’ m Ted , who are you ? __eou__ Huh ? Oh , my name is Laura . __eou__ Do you somewhere often , Laura ? __eou__ Huh ? I can ’ t hear you , the music ’ s too loud . __eou__ Let ’ s go outside and talk . So Laura , do you come here often ? __eou__ Hold on , my ears are still ringing from the music ... what was it you asked me ? __eou__ I asked if you come here often . __eou__ Sometimes , usually once every few weeks . Do you ? __eou__ No , this is my first time here . __eou__ I usually come with a group of friends . We dance a little , have a few drinks , and just have a good time . __eou__ Yeah , that ’ s why I ’ m here . My friends dragged me here , because they think I spend too much time studying . __eou__ That ’ s good . It ’ s good to hit the books , but you need to get out once in a while . __eou__ I guess so . But the music is too loud . I don ’ t mind getting out and meeting people , but next time I ’ ll do it in a park . __eou__
People are funny . __eou__ They sure are . __eou__ Did you hear about the pilot ? __eou__ The one that stole a small plane ? __eou__ Yes , he stole a plane in Canada and flew into the U . S . __eou__ Did they catch him ? __eou__ Yes . After two U .

You're going to Shanghai tomorrow , are you ? __eou__ That's right . Do you think it'll be cold ? __eou__ It might be . You'd better take a heavy sweater with you.The nights are usually quite cold at this time of year . __eou__ Do you think I'll need a cotton coat ? __eou__ Not for now , I think , But I believe there'll be rain , so take your raincoat with you . __eou__
Did you watch the Premiership last night ? __eou__ Yes , I watched United play Chelsea . What a fierce battle ! allay were engaged in intensive pressing and tackling in midfield . Well , it was not like a normal English League match . __eou__ No , it wasn't . Rather , it looked like a Bundesliga match , where physical contact is so frequent . English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes . It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly . As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly , they often knew only chasing hard after the ball , but forgot to steal it . __eou__ Haha . That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common , and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent . And the ball is often kept flying overhead , drawing beautiful curves in the sky . Such games are quite pleasing to the eye . __eou__ Which team do you back then ? __eou__ I'm a firm United supporter . I like their playing style . The Reds always have several excellent wing-backs , Like Riggs , Peckham and Gary Neville . They often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking . __eou__ But the Reds keep a weak midfield . I think Juventas of Italian Series A have always maintained a very formidable midfield . It is the main source of its strength . __eou__

How would you like to pay for it ? __eou__ I'll pay for it with a check . __eou__ Would you like to pay for any extra permits for another vehicle ? __eou__ No , thanks ; I'm fine . __eou__ Here you go then . Have a great school year ! __eou__
What's your major in college ? __eou__ I take architecture as my major . __eou__ What research are you dealing with now ? __eou__ I am dealing with the study of the architecture style of ancient Chinese buildings . __eou__
Would you like to go to a concert with me ? __eou__ I'd love to . __eou__

They promised us a sea view . __eou__ Well , you can just see the sea . Between the factory chimneys . __eou__ Isn't it awful ? I can't bear to look at it . I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks . __eou__ Well , it can't be helped . We'll just have to put up with it . __eou__
You are saying he will be promoted to the general manager ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Are you sure ? __eou__ Yes . I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted . __eou__ Just because he gets on well with everybody ? __eou__ Partly , and he's also a hard working man . __eou__

Have you ever been in one of his classes ? __eou__ I'm thinking about taking his class next semester . __eou__ He was a very easy teacher . Are you thinking of taking a class with him ? __eou__ I'm not sure because I really need to learn something , but I also worry about grades . __eou__ Grades are important , but don't you think that gaining the knowledge is important , too ? __eou__ I really need to learn this stuff . __eou__ He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by . Do you know what I mean ? __eou__ Yes , that sounds right for me . __eou__ Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military ? __eou__ Yeah , I already knew that . That could be a good thing . __eou__ I think you know that you have to make the best decision for you . Enjoy your year ! __eou__

Hi , Bob , everything okay ? __eou__ more or less . There's just one thing bothering me . __eou__ oh ? What's that ? __eou__ well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kind made me uneasy . __eou__ what gift ? __eou__ it's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift __eou__ you refused the gift ? That's terrible . __eou__ I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way . __eou__ perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade . __eou__ that's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . __eou__
It is so quiet here . I like the place . __eou__ Me too . __eou__ I can't stand the loud noise in the city . __eou__ Yes , sometimes I can hardly get asleep at night . __eou__ I hope I can stay here longer . __eou__ When will your vacation end ? __eou__ The day after tomorrow . __eou__ You will go back tomorrow , right ? __eou__ Yes , you are right . __eou__

I wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments . They are working very hard these days .

Do you know the danger of swimming without warm-up ? __eou__ As far as I know , people will be weak if they swim too long . __eou__ That's right . But the most dangerous thing is that their legs may spasm out of control when swimming . __eou__ Is it very dangerous ? I'm a little scared . Do you offer the lifebuoy for us ? __eou__ Yes , besides that , we also provide our customers with goggles , swimming suit and something like that . __eou__ Do you have the workers to save me if anything should happen ? __eou__ Of course , all the workers here are able to swim , and they will come to your aid quickly . __eou__

Which service offered by your bank do you use most ? __eou__ I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money from once currency to another . I often travel abroad , you see . __eou__ Do you ever ask you bank for traveller ’ s cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around . __eou__ I sometimes use traveller ’ s cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash . __eou__ Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit . __eou__ Yes , I do . It save me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines . __eou__ That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too . __eou__ Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others . __eou__ I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher . __eou__ I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use . __eou__ That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain . __eou__
I am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ? __eou__ Well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . There are so many good choices . __eou__ The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun . I just don ’ t know what to do first . __eou__ Why not start with the most interesting one ? __eou__ Actually , I ’ m interested in all of them . The more choices we have , the harder to make a decision . __eou__ Toss a coin to decide then . __eou__

That sounds interesting . __eou__
So , Jack , do you believe in ghosts ? __eou__ No , not really . Why do you ask ? __eou__ Because I want to tell you about the time that I saw a ghost . __eou__ You saw a ghost ? When ? __eou__ It was many years ago , when I was a little child . It was the middle of the night , and I went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs , when ... __eou__ So that's where you saw the ghost ? In your house ? What did it look like ? Was it hideous ? __eou__ It was a big , green thing that looked like a person . It was in the kitchen , and it slowly moved towards the stairs ... __eou__ So what did you do ? __eou__ I hid so that it couldn't see me . Slowly it got closer and closer , until ... __eou__ Until what ? What happened ? Did you see it clearly ? Did it attack you ? __eou__ It moved slowly up the stairs , step by step , and I could hear its approaching footsteps . When it finally got to the top of the stairs , I realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . He had gone to get a late night snack . __eou__
Are you getting overtime ? __eou__ Yes , but it's not so appetizing . __eou__ Have you thought about another job ? __eou__ That's what's hanging on my mind recently . __eou__
I bought it . I got a watch , too . The company that sells this car has a car club . __eou__ Where you can buy lots of paraphernalia ? __eou__ Yeah , and meet other drivers of the same car ! __eou__ Cool ! __eou__ I know girls love this kind of car . Look , it's got a sunroof ! Imagine ... a cool , starry night ... __eou__ So , you're going to use Sarah's car to go cruising for chicks ? __eou__ No . I borrowed it to go shopping . __eou__
Quite a few people are laid off these days . __eou__ Yeah . It is not easy for them to find another job . __eou__ University graduates have difficulty finding a job too .

Do you want to quit your job ? __eou__ No . Not now . I think I'll try to keep this one . __eou__

What kind of jobs are becoming popular in your country ? __eou__ As in many countries , there ’ s been a big growth in anything related to computers . Young people are attracted to that field in particular . There ’ s also been a big growth in education . __eou__ There ’ s been a growth in that field in my country too . A lot of people want to learn practical and professional skills . __eou__ The interesting thing is that many of the teachers are not actually trained teachers . They are usually professionals who are taking a break from their jobs to pass on skills to others . __eou__ I noticed that too . What are the people learning ? __eou__ In my country , they are usually studying something business-related , such as marketing , management techniques , and human resource management . __eou__ I think that jobs in the leisure industry will become more popular in the future . __eou__ That trend has already begun in my country . In particular , there ’ s a big demand for people to work in fitness centers . Which kinds of jobs are less in demand ? __eou__ Those in traditional fields , such as agriculture and heavy industry . Younger people are not interested in doing those jobs and other countries have industries that can produce things much cheaper . __eou__ Yes . My country is certainly expanding in the service and hi-tech sectors , but contracting in the heavy industry and primary industry sectors . However , our car and aircraft manufacturers are doing very well . __eou__ They are well known for high quality , that ’ s why . __eou__

Sometimes , I even let other people make key decision for me . __eou__ what kinds of decisions do you leave to other people ? __eou__ there are basic decisions like which restaurant to go to .

I've got to put together a sales pitch to give to our clients in the morning . You always give such amazing presentations , I was hoping you could give me some advice about how to win them over tomorrow . __eou__ Sure , it's easy . First of all , the secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple . People are listening and they usually don't have a long attention spans . Stick to about three or four points , give an overview of the points , then present them one by one , and then summarize at the end . Be straightforward and organized and you're sure to be remembered . __eou__ What kind of visuals should I use to support the presentation ? Do you think I should use PowerPoint ? __eou__ You should consider the size and interests of your audience . In other words , who is listening , and what do they want to hear ... you can put together a PPT with some graphics and animations that will catch people's attention , but be careful not to go overboard . __eou__ I think I can put something together , no problem . But when it comes to tomorrow , I'll just be a bundle of nerves ! How can I get over my fear of speaking in public ? __eou__ You know , stage fright is very normal , most people get nervous before they have to speak in front of large groups . Just prepare well , rehearse beforehand , and trust that you will be great ... and you will be ! __eou__
Hey , Shirley ! Want to join me for lunch ... my treat ! __eou__ Wow ! Sure ! __eou__ I must confess I have an ulterior motive for asking you to lunch . __eou__ Oh ... that's OK ... as long as you're buying ! __eou__ I really want to pick your brain about something I've been thinking a lot about . __eou__ I'd love to help if I can . __eou__ Well , as you know , I have a Bachelor's degree in English literature and that's served me well so far , but I've always wanted to do some post-graduate work ... maybe even get a Doctorate ! __eou__ Wow ! Just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain . __eou__ But you have a Master's degree ... hasn't that helped your career ? __eou__ Yeah , I'd have to say it has . But I'm still paying for it , you know . __eou__ I know education is expensive , but it's been my lifelong dream . Call me crazy , but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name . __eou__ Well , getting a Doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school . Can you afford that ? Can you survive that ? __eou__ I certainly can't afford it , but I'm sure I could find some good student loans . __eou__ I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling . It's not as romantic as you might think . __eou__ Yeah ... I keep thinking about what I'll do with a Master's or Doctorate . I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare . __eou__ Uh huh , that's for sure . You might find that your only career choice is teaching other graduate students . __eou__
Do you mind if we call on you this evening ? __eou__ Of course not , we'd be happy if you could come.What time will you be able to come ? __eou__ How about seven o'clock ? __eou__ Fine.We ' ll be expecting you . __eou__
Hey , May , how are you doing ? __eou__ Oh , I'm a little busy these days . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ Don ’ t you know Christmas is coming ? I have a lot of things to get ready . __eou__ But you ’ re in China . Are you planning on going home for Christmas ? __eou__ Yeah , so I have to buy presents for everyone before I leave . __eou__ Why not just give them money in red envelopes ? That would be much easier . __eou__ Americans don ’ t like giving money , they prefer presents you buy for them . So I have to figure out what to buy for all of my family and friends . __eou__ I've got it . I won ’ t bother you any more . You ’ d better hurry to do it , Christmas is just around the corner . __eou__ I will . Merry Christmas . __eou__
Peter really is a remarkable expert ! There is very little he doesn ’ t know . __eou__ I have exactly the same feeling . This afternoon he explained the ins and outs of the stock market to me . He knows a lot about investments . __eou__
How big is your family ? __eou__ My family is not big , there are only 3 of us-my parents and I . __eou__ Who supports the family ? __eou__ My father supports the family , and he is the sole breadwinner . My mother is a housewife . __eou__ Do you live with your family ? __eou__ Yes , we live a happy life together . __eou__
This is the good life ! We have it good don ’ t you think ? __eou__ Yeah of course ! Although , don ’ t you ever wonder what “ could have been ” ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ Like for example , if I hadn ’ t studied architecture , I would have become an artist like I wanted to . __eou__ I see . Yeah now that I think of it , I wouldn ’ t have gotten married if I hadn ’ t moved to this town and met Sally . __eou__ You see ! Everything happens for a reason ! We wouldn ’ t even have met if I hadn ’ t been in that car accident ten years ago ! __eou__ Well , I have no regrets ! __eou__ I ’ ll drink to that ! __eou__
Excuse me ? I didn't hear what you said . __eou__ I asked you if you wanted some help . __eou__ I am new to this school and not familiar with this library . Can you help me ? __eou__ Certainly . What's your topic ? __eou__ I'm looking for information on tropical fish . __eou__ All right . You can use the computer over there , enter ' tropical fish'under subject . If you know the title of the book , enter it under ' title ' __eou__ Great , thank you . __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__
I hate landing in the sand trap ! Now I'm probably going to waste strokes getting it out . __eou__ At least you haven't landed in the water yet . I've done that on the last two holes . __eou__ Could you hand me my wedge ? I'll try ... __eou__ Here you go . I'll wait for you to get on the green before I putt . __eou__ No . you go ahead and putt it out . Then I'Il go . __eou__ No way , Mary . I'm going to let you go first . I don't want the pressure of putting first . __eou__
excuse me , is this the way to the Greta Wall ? __eou__ oh , it is really far from here . You ’ re going in the wrong direction actually . __eou__ I must have taken a wrong turn . __eou__ it doesn ’ t matter . Go back the way you came . After about five kilometers , you ’ ll see a hotel on the side of the road . It ’ s a big one . You can ’ t miss it . __eou__ and then ? __eou__ take the next right . Drive about one click further , and you ’ ll see the entrance of the highway to the Great Wall . __eou__ thanks a lot . __eou__ you ’ re welcome . __eou__ by the way , how long does it take ? __eou__ without traffic , it takes about an hour . __eou__ I heard the Great Wall closes early in the afternoon . Do you think I can make it before closing ? __eou__ yes , I think so . It doesn ’ t close until 5 o ’ clock . You still have plenty of time . __eou__ great ! Thank you ! __eou__ my pleasure , and have a good time ! __eou__
Hello , Deva , how are you ? __eou__ Can't complain . What about you ? __eou__ Not bad . Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband ? __eou__ I've heard . She looks quite depressed . __eou__ Yes . They used to be joined at the hip . __eou__ I heard they were just married for 5 months . __eou__ Yes , she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things . __eou__ Yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden . __eou__ You said it . You know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage . __eou__ Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married . __eou__ Yeah . We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners . __eou__ Definitely . That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce . __eou__ We've heard so much about Chinese film stars divorcing foreigners . __eou__ That's true.Just hope Wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon . __eou__
hi , betty ! __eou__ hi , Andy , how are you finding your new job ? __eou__ pretty good . My colleagues seem alright . So far everything is great . __eou__ that's nice . What do they have you doing over there ? __eou__ well , I work in the marketing department . The corporate culture is totally different from my last employer . Before , when I was assigned a task , I was totally on my own but here most of the work is don __eou__ that ' s really good . It's very important to feel like you are part of the team at work . __eou__ indeed . Team work is highly valued in this new company . I like our boss too . He is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation . He's highly respected by all his employees . __eou__ that's great , that's good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees . I wish my boss was like that . __eou__ true , take my former supervisor as an example . He was extremely controlling and overbearing . He always had to micromanage everything . __eou__ well , now you don't have to worry about that . This new place sounds really good . __eou__ yeah it is . __eou__
I heard you're getting married , James . Congratulations ! __eou__ Thank you , Wendy . I hope you'll be able to make it to the wedding . __eou__ I'm looking forward to it . __eou__
What lovely weather ! __eou__ It's so pleasant after the bad weather we've been having . __eou__ Let's go out and enjoy the fresh air . __eou__ All right.Let ' s go . __eou__
Do you keep any pets , such as cats , dogs ? __eou__ No , I'm scared of cats . __eou__ Oh , but why ? __eou__ I feel they're dirty . __eou__
I would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans . __eou__ Really ? I ’ m not sure that I would like all the attention . There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star ’ s private live in recent years . __eou__ I love being photographed ! If I were famous , I ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines , like cosmo and elle . __eou__ I wouldn ’ t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice , but it would get tedious after a while . Imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you . __eou__ No-one really believes gossip columnists . __eou__ I think you ’ ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . You ’ d also have to be very careful about every word you said . If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly , it __eou__ I think you ’ re right about that . I ’ d need a good manager to be my spokesperson . I could do a lot of charity work , which would help a lot of people . __eou__ That ’ s a great idea . Which charities would you support ? __eou__ I love children , as you know , so probably a children ’ s charity . __eou__ You ’ d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity , so you ’ d really need to be very careful . Anyway , I ’ d be the first to buy your posters and I ’ d attend your first book - __eou__ Thanks , but actually I was hoping I could ask you to write my biography . __eou__
It's terrible how things have changed.You remember there used to be trees on all these hills . __eou__ Really ? There aren't many left now . __eou__ No , they've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away . __eou__ Were there any animals in the forest ? __eou__ Yes , I can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds.But nowadays you just don't see the birds that you used to see around here . __eou__
Henry , do you know how much we spent this month ? __eou__ No , I'm not clear . __eou__ we've spent $ 1,000 . __eou__ Don't make a fuss.The price is rising __eou__
Where are you living ? __eou__ I live in the southern part of this city . I rent a house . __eou__ Do you move a lot ? __eou__ No , I don't . __eou__
Hey , Gucci . I didn't know it would be a charity show . You can see there are many collecting boxes at the entrance . __eou__ Oh , I forgot to tell you this . The show is to collect money for children in need . And all the money from ticket selling will go to the Red Cross . __eou__ That's really a good thing . Let's do our part . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__ Who will sing in the show ? __eou__ A lot of stars , including Andy , Justin , Mendy ... __eou__ Mendy ? Are you sure ? I love her songs ! __eou__ Me too . She is so young and talented . She is not only a singer but also a great composer herself . __eou__ Yeah . Though she was so popular , I heard she managed to maintain a low profile . __eou__ She is a real star . Not a onetime thing . __eou__ But I also heard some people didn't like her music . I don't understand why . She is so amazing ! __eou__ Well , I suppose people have different tastes on music . Moreover , here stuff is really strong and creative . It takes time for people to accept new things . __eou__ You are right . Anyway , things will be different as the days go on . She can get it . I have faith in her . __eou__ Sure . That makes a good fan . Do you know what songs she is gonna sing tonight ? __eou__ Here is the programme . Check it out yourself ! __eou__ OK . __eou__
What's your hobby ? __eou__ Photograph . __eou__ What's the make of your camera ? __eou__ Olympus . __eou__ Do you own your own darkroom ? __eou__ No , usually I get my films developed at a photo studio , but I make my own enlargements . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because I can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . That's more , but that saves money . __eou__
Lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair . __eou__ Thanks , June . But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic 5 before I ’ m allowed to repair cars for a living . __eou__ That ’ s not a big problem . There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified . __eou__ I guess I never thought of that before . __eou__ And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government . __eou__ Wow , you ’ Ve inspired me to do something ! __eou__
How is the college search going ? __eou__ It's a huge headache . I have no idea what I want to do . __eou__ But don't you want to study music ? Shouldn't it be easy ? __eou__ It should be , but there are too many options . My grades are good enough that I have a lot of choices , but after that ... __eou__ I know . You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country , a big school or a small school , a public or private school ... __eou__ Yup , you understand . And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college . They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline . And the tuition is usually pretty low . __eou__ I see . Well , don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school . He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction . He gave me some information , and next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended . __eou__ Thanks for the information . And good luck in your college search . __eou__
I seldom heard the quarreling of her children . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ Because her children have been the age when they seem to quarrel all day long . __eou__ Oh , I see . She told me that she had learned very quickly how to pour oil on troubled waters , but not to pour oil on the flame . __eou__ She is a clever mother . __eou__
I haven't met you at the gym for a long time . __eou__ yeah , I quit my job , and started working from home . Recently I've got a project to deal with and don't have much time to work out . __eou__ why ? You have a decent salary , lots of promotion opportunities and a regular life of going to the office at 9 o ' clock and coming back home at 5 in the evening . __eou__ it's not about pay raise or promotion . You know , I hate getting up early in the morning and coming back home late at night . __eou__ then SOHO is your ideal work style . __eou__ yeah , as long as I have a computer and internet access , I can start working . I recently enjoy working in my own place and at my own pace . __eou__ and you don't have to work under that much pressure and control . __eou__ absolutely . I can decide when and what to do all by myself . __eou__ sounds great . Are there many business opportunity ? __eou__ yeah , I can find enough online . __eou__ it's good to have business around . But you should also do some exercise to keep fit . __eou__ thank you for reminding me . I'll continue to exercise as soon as I finish this project . __eou__
What did you say when she told you the news ? __eou__ I calmed up . And finally , I asked her to chew the cud for such an important decision . I could not have the heart to disappoint her with a blunt refusal . __eou__ But I put my foot down and insisted on her forgetting that . __eou__ How could have the heart to do that ? She needs warmth and help . __eou__
Can I borrow some money from you ? __eou__ No way ! __eou__
How do your spend your time after work or in vacation ? __eou__ In my spare time , I am fond of traveling and I always take a trip with my family . __eou__ But traveling is an expensive hobby , isn't it ? __eou__ You are deadly right . __eou__
I really have a good time here.Thank you very much . __eou__ Keep in touch ! __eou__ I promise . __eou__
Where is Pamela ? __eou__ Is she coming ? __eou__ She told me she'd be here . __eou__ They are announcing your flight . You'd better board the plane . __eou__ Are you rushing me ? __eou__ I am just reminding you about the time . You don't want to miss the plane , do you ? __eou__ I know what I am doing . Don't worry . Can you do me a favor ? __eou__ Name it and I'll do it for you . __eou__ Take care of Pamela when I am away . She is a nice girl . I don't want her to get hurt or anything . __eou__ I've got it . __eou__ Thank you . Now I see that you are my true friend . Most of my so-called friends left me at the moment my company went bankrupt . You are the only one who has stood by me the whole time . __eou__ I am just doing what I think I should do . __eou__ Thank you for being a friend of mine . __eou__ This isn't like you ... Well , I hope you will have a nice flight and a successful start in business . __eou__ Thank you . I have to leave now . If you see Pamela , tell her I'll write to her . __eou__
What's the weather today ? __eou__ It's fine today . __eou__ What was the weather like yesterday ? __eou__ It rained all day yesterday . The weather was awful last week . __eou__ What will the weather be like tomorrow ? __eou__ It's going to be sunny tomorrow . __eou__
Tom's new business will do well . __eou__ I don't think so . There's too much competition . __eou__
Hi , Charlie ! What are you reading ? __eou__ Hi , bob . I ’ m reading a biography ? __eou__ Who ’ s it about ? __eou__ It ’ s about Bob Dylan . __eou__ Who is he ? __eou__ He ’ s a famous American musician . __eou__ Who ’ s the author ? __eou__ It was written by Howard Sounds . __eou__ What do you think about it ? __eou__ It ’ s great ! I ’ Ve learned a lot from reading it . __eou__ Can I read it when you ’ re done ? __eou__ Sure , bob ! I ’ m on chapter 12 now , so I ’ m almost finished . __eou__ How many chapters does the book have ? __eou__ There are 15 chapters in total . __eou__ When do you think you ’ ll have finished reading it ? __eou__ I should be done by Friday . I ’ ll give it to you in class then . __eou__ Thanks . Charlie ! __eou__ No problem . Bob . __eou__
How are you getting along with your wife now ? __eou__ What can you expect ? Not that good . __eou__ What are you going to do then ? __eou__ Just let it go . __eou__ How are your work now ? __eou__ Not bad , just let it go . __eou__
I've been thinking about getting my hair cut . __eou__ I thought you were going to let it grow out long . __eou__ I said that , didn't I ? But I just don't know what to do with it . __eou__ You're in one of those in-between stages , aren't you . __eou__ Yes , it's not short enough to be wash-and-go and not long enough to do anything fancy . __eou__ Have you thought about wearing a hat ? __eou__ Everywhere I go ? __eou__ Well , it's one way to get through the in-betweens if you really want to grow it out ! __eou__
Didn't you say you were planning a trip to China ? I heard the northwest and north of China are experiencing severe sandstorms ! __eou__ I was planning to go to Beijing first and then go to northwest China ! Looks like I'm in trouble . __eou__ Definitely . I heard Beijing was experiencing seven degree strong winds ! That is nearly a record high ! __eou__ No way ! I don't think I've ever encountered winds that strong ! Are the storms affecting land and air transportation ? __eou__ Absolutely ! I don't think any planes are going anywhere . The sand being blown around has cut visibility in Beijing to less than 100 meters . But inseems Gansu Province is being hit the hardest . __eou__ That's exactly where I was planning to go ! __eou__ Well , this storm originated in the plateaus in northwest China . At the moment , that area is calmer . __eou__
Hey , Jenny . Would you like to go to dinner with me ? __eou__ I don't know . You know what they say about office romances . __eou__ No , I don't . What do they say about office romances ? __eou__ They say you shouldn't mix love and work . __eou__ That's silly . What I do on my own time is no one else ’ s business . Besides , it's pretty hard to meet people outside of the office when we spend long hours here . __eou__ You ’ Ve got a point . Once I dated one of my supervisors and all of my co-workers accused him of favoritism . Then when the relationship went bad , he fired me . __eou__ People fall in love with people they work with . That's a fact . __eou__ That may be true , but I don't want an inter-office relationship to affect my productivity . __eou__ If it does , it will only make you more productive , because we can support each other . __eou__ You are sounding like we are already married . __eou__ Good grief . All I did was ask you out . I am sorry . __eou__ Well , I don't feel right about it . __eou__ I am talking about dinner tonight , not a lifetime . __eou__ Most starts with dinner , but then it gets out of hand . Besides , haven't you asked out every woman in the entire office ? __eou__ I like company . __eou__ Company ? I heard about you from Linda . She said you were an octopus ! __eou__ What can I say ? I am a passionate guy . __eou__ Well , I hope you can find something else to be passionate about . __eou__ You want to go out with me and you know it . __eou__ In your dreams . Now if you don't mind , I've got some work to do . __eou__ Ok , I get the message . Hey , do you have any sisters ? __eou__
I ’ m looking forward to relaxing this coming weekend . __eou__ I hope that I can finally find free time too . I ’ Ve been so busy at work recently . __eou__ How might you spend the weekend . __eou__ I hope to do a little gardening . I find it very relaxing . __eou__ I might do that too . I hope the weather is nice . I could go and play some golf . __eou__ I heard that the weather should be good . There ’ s a possibility of a shower , but it ’ s not very likely . __eou__ Hopefully , we ’ ll both have relaxing weekends . __eou__ Of course , something could come up and stop that wish coming true . __eou__ Unfortunately , there ’ s always the possibility of some urgent work requiring our attention . __eou__
Do you drink the Robust Milk every day ? __eou__ Not every day , but occasionally . __eou__ It will make you as fit as a fiddle . __eou__ I don't believe ads.What ' s more , I'm already in perfect health . __eou__
In my country , we go to school from 8 o'clock in the morning until five in the afternoon . __eou__ Five days a week , too ? __eou__ Actually , five and a half.On Saturday , we have classes only in the morning . __eou__ Gosh ! __eou__ That's too much for us really . __eou__ Where are you going now ? __eou__ I'm going to try to find out where the school is located . __eou__ When do you start school ? __eou__ I'm going to register right now . __eou__ That's good . __eou__
Well , what about it ? As it happens I've got two tickets for next thursday evening . I thought perhaps . __eou__ Well , thanks all the same , Denise . But no I don't think.Sorry , I'm sure you would enjoy it . I'd like to Denise , but I'm busy on friday this week and next week too . __eou__ But I said thursday.The tickets are for thursday evening . __eou__ Thursday ? Oh , sorry . I meant thursday too . I mean I busy then too . __eou__ I see.Oh , well some other time perhaps . __eou__ Yes . some other time perhaps.Thanks again . __eou__
Where were you last night , at exactly nine twenty PM ? __eou__ nine twenty pm , I couldn't say . I cann't remember . __eou__ Are you sure you cann't remember ? __eou__ I've absolutely certain . __eou__ Were you in or out ? Can you remember that ? __eou__ I'm not quite positive . I think I went out at about half pass nine . __eou__ Did you see anyone come into the block flats ? __eou__ No , I didn't . __eou__ Sure ? __eou__ Quite sure . __eou__
Jim is a genius . He gets along well with everybody and he can always get the work done . __eou__ A boss likes him a lot . He says Jim is a good team player . __eou__ Everybody would like to have Jim on their team . Because he is funny and helpful and he can contribute a lot to the team he belongs to . __eou__ Maybe we all should learn something from him . __eou__ Right . __eou__
John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ? __eou__ Poor , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ? __eou__ It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day . __eou__ You forgot all of about it , didn't you ? __eou__
Happy birthday ! Many happy returns ( of the day ) . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
Hey , Joe ! Where have you been these past few days ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been busy with a first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red Cross . __eou__ Cool ! I ’ Ve always wanted to do something like that ! Have you learned anything useful ? __eou__ For sure ! I mean we ’ Ve learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding , how to check for a pulse , and even how to apply CPR ! __eou__ Have you treated any real emergencies ? __eou__ Well , they took us along with some paramedics.There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures . His wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital . It was intense ! __eou__ I can imagine ! I tend to faint when I see blood , so I think I won ’ t be taking up a course like that anytime soon ! __eou__
Hello ? __eou__ Good morning , Nathaniel . This is Leah calling from the International Student Office . __eou__ Good morning . __eou__ The reason I'm calling is because Ms . Collins will not be able to call you back until next week . __eou__ Oh . I had hoped she would have called me back yesterday . __eou__ She's terribly sorry about that . She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week . She hopes you understand . __eou__ Is there someone else I can talk to ? __eou__ She asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today . When are you free today ? __eou__ Any time after 2 pm today would be good for me . __eou__ Mr . Liu is available at 2:15 today . Will that work for you ? __eou__ I'd prefer to speak with Ms . Fonda . __eou__ I'm afraid she isn't available this afternoon . She has an opening at 11:30 this morning . Will that work for you ? __eou__ That will be fine . __eou__ Ok , we'll be expecting you at 11:30 then . See you then . __eou__
I work so hard that I do not have the energy to exercise . __eou__ That is just an excuse . You can always find some time to exercise . __eou__ But I work hard all the time for long hours . Often I have no time for lunch . Yet , I am still getting fatter . __eou__ Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . And skipping meals will not help you lose weight . In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals . __eou__ I know you're right , but what can I do ? __eou__ How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ? __eou__ But I'll miss the news . It's important in my business to keep up with events in China . __eou__ I know , I know . Have you got a portable radio ? You can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time . __eou__ That's a good idea ! __eou__
I'll always remember my college days . __eou__ Oh yeah ? __eou__ It was one of the best times in my life . It was tough , but I made it . I became a college graduate . __eou__ How did you feel when you graduated ? __eou__ It was a round day for me . My family attend the graduation ceremony . I was so nervous . I couldn't find my cap and gown , but all worked out in the end . __eou__ What did you do after graduation ? __eou__ I was planning to attend gradate school , but then I was offered a good job doing marketing , so I changed my mind . __eou__ Sounds like you're happy with your decision . __eou__ I sure am . So what about you ? How did you feel when you graduated ? __eou__ It was also a proud day for me , but I also felt like a kind of loss that day . __eou__ How could it be ? __eou__ While seeing others going to work or continue their study , I didn't know what I would do . __eou__ You didn't have an offer ? __eou__ I had one , but I didn't like the job very much . I wanted to attend graduate school , but I was afraid it would be too tough . __eou__ I think you lack in the power of decision . Once you make your decision , don't be overtaken by misgivings and fear . Just go full steam ahead ! __eou__
John's father got married again . __eou__ Married whom ? __eou__ If I tell you . , you must be completely taken aback . __eou__ Come on . Tell me what happened . __eou__ He married a girl who is only eighteen ! __eou__ Is that true ? But anyhow , it's none of our business , isn't it ? __eou__

I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They ’ re famous , so everyone loves them . __eou__ I think they must have horrible lives . All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . They must get sick of it . __eou__ I bet they love it really . Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films . __eou__ No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ’ t even pay for Drin __eou__ Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ’ s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to Wea __eou__ I don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ’ re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored . __eou__ I think you should give them some credit . They ’ re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves __eou__ Come on ! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves . __eou__
What's the matter , Lisa ? You don't look too good . __eou__ I just found out that my husband is cheating on me . __eou__ You mean Mark ? He seems like such an honest guy . __eou__ That's what I thought . It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months . __eou__ Two months ? How did you find out ? __eou__ I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark . She then asked if I was his sister , and I said no , I was his wife . She hung up immediately . __eou__ So you asked him about the girl who called ? __eou__ Yeah , he first said it was someone from work . He gave me a lame excuse , and so I pressed him on it . __eou__ What'd he do ? __eou__ He kept trying to make stupid excuses , and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion . __eou__ Indiscretion ? How can an indiscretion last two months ? I mean , you two have been married for two years ! How can he do that to you ? __eou__ I told him I would divorce him if he wouldn ’ t tell me the truth or end the relationship with her . __eou__ Good . I totally agree with what you did . __eou__
So do you believe in palmistry ? __eou__ Palmistry ? What is that ? __eou__ It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future . __eou__ Oh , you mean palm reading . I've seen that before , but I don't believe in it . __eou__ Are you sure ? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . Do you want me to take a look at your hand ? __eou__ Really ? You've read books about it ? Ok , then . But only if you want to . __eou__ Ok , let's see , well , you've got a long life line , which is good , and the love line is strong ... __eou__ What else do you see ? Will I be successful ? Will I make a lot of money ? __eou__ Hmm , hard to say , wait , yes , it looks like you will do well in business , and your ambition will help you a lot , but ... __eou__ What ? What is it ? What's the matter ? __eou__ You seem to have a large gullibility line . You believe everything that you're told . __eou__
Welcome back movie lovers to another Premier Movie Review . My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite DavidWatson . __eou__ Thank you Dick . Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King . Tell me Dave , what is your impression of this film ? __eou__ Well , I think this film is simply a fable , depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power , and in my opinion , it ’ s a very fine film . Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting . __eou__ I think otherwise . Even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by Elton John were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . And I would dare to say , it was too predictable . __eou__ Predictable ! How ! Come on Dick , It ’ s a G-rated movie ! It ’ s for the kids ! It ’ s not a thriller ! __eou__ Well , that ’ s just it . It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of Scar . Even so , the film is linear . Mufasal dies , Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . It ’ s just too cliche . __eou__ How can it be cliche ? It ’ s a fable ! It ’ s telling a time-honoured story ! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love . __eou__ You have always been so soft , Dave ! __eou__ Open your heart Dick . Don ’ t shut us out . __eou__ Anyway ... That ’ s all for today folks ! Join us next time as we talk about & quot , How to lose a guy in 10 days & quot , I ’ m sure you ’ ll love that one Dave ! __eou__
Hi , Walter ! __eou__ Hi , Sterling ! __eou__ What do you think of our new teacher ? __eou__ Professor Wood ? I think he's a brilliant scientist . __eou__ You're got a point there . But do you think he's a little absent-minded ? __eou__ I guess so . __eou__
It gives me great pleasure to introduce Mr ... eh Mr ... __eou__ Miss ! __eou__ Yeah ! May I introduce Mis ... eh ... Miss ... __eou__ My name is Jane Brown ! __eou__ Oh yeah ! Would you please welcome ... Miss Jan Brown . __eou__
I stayed online chatting with friends all night . It was great fun . __eou__ I don't understand . You don't even know the ' friends ' you are ' talking ' to ! __eou__ It is better I don't know them . So I can say anything I want . __eou__ Do you believe what they say ? __eou__ Who cares ? It's just online . It's not real . Do you want to join me tonight ? __eou__ Thanks , but I'm a lousy typist . __eou__
We scored six goals . __eou__ I don't believe it . __eou__ And I score three of them . __eou__ You are not serious ? __eou__ We had extra time of course . __eou__ I can believe that . __eou__
This is tough to say , Jordan , but I think we should break up . __eou__ Are you serious ? __eou__ Yes , I mean it . __eou__ But why ? Did I do anything wrong ? __eou__ No , we are just too different . This isn ’ t working . __eou__ Hey , come on . It ’ s too early to say that . We can fix things . __eou__ I have thought about it for a while . I think it ’ s time to move on for both of us . __eou__ But I still love you . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . __eou__ I knew this would happen some day ... __eou__ Then why didn ’ t you talk to me ? __eou__ Well . It ’ s not all my fault , Anna ... __eou__ I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough , but Let ’ s try and be friends . __eou__ I would like that Anna , but I think I ’ ll need a little space for a bit . __eou__ I think we ’ ll be better off if we are apart . __eou__ Shall we keep pur friendship ? __eou__ Sure , let ’ s just be friends . __eou__
Who's that ? __eou__ Saint Jude-he's the saint of lost causes . Like my cousin , Anna , who can't stop getting pregnant . She's a lost cause . __eou__ Is that your cousin in the back ? __eou__ Yep . She's always got a bun in the oven . She was pregnant before marriage-a real sin in the Catholic Church . __eou__ What about birth control pills ? Don't they work on Italians ? __eou__ Ha-ha . Birth control and abortion are four-letter words in my family . __eou__ And I heard that Italian men have very active libidos . __eou__
Hi , Lander . What's wrong ? __eou__ I can hardly make ends meet these days . __eou__ Same here .

The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities . __eou__ Definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month . __eou__
You look a bit dull today . What's up ? __eou__ Well , my mum lost her job yesterday . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . Well , I heard that registered urban unemployment rate reached 4 percent this year , with more than half being women . __eou__ The supply outstrips the demand in the job market and women are in a disadvantageous position as a whole . __eou__ Yeah , it's true . What is she going to do ? __eou__ Well , she is thinking of doing some household cleaning or baby sitting in the community . __eou__ That's not bad . It could be a short-term alternative . Your mum can look for another one when the market improves . Things will work out eventually . __eou__ Thank you . I just hope she won't feel pressed . __eou__
You don't look too well . What's going on ? __eou__ I just lost my job . I'm just worried about how I'm going to pay the bills . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . Have you been looking for another job ? __eou__ I just started , but the job market is very bad right now . I'm not optimistic about it . __eou__ That's tough . What does your wife think about this ? __eou__ She's trying to be supportive , but I can tell she is very worried about our financial situation as well . __eou__ I have some friends who might be able to help you find a job . I'll see what they can do . __eou__ I really appreciate your help . __eou__ No problem . In the meantime , don't try to worry so much . You'll get through this . __eou__
Let me tell you what happened to my homework . __eou__ OK , go ahead--what is the excuse THIS time ? __eou__ Actually , I did it , but then it got lost . __eou__ Could you have gotten it done at another time ? __eou__ Yes , I could . __eou__ You have never missed an assignment before--when will you be making this one up ? __eou__ I'll make it up early next week . __eou__ That would work , but don't let it happen again . __eou__ I'll try . __eou__ That will solve it then . Let's work hard to not let it happen again . __eou__
Do you want to try your hand at tennis ? __eou__ Certainly I do . __eou__ It seems you're very fond of it . __eou__ I'd be happy to do something new . __eou__
This is how a holiday should be . Relaxing on the beach with a nice cool drink . __eou__ Isn ’ t it wonderful here ? The kids are enjoying themselves in the swimming pool .

Could I have another drink pleas ? Thank you . So , what shall we do this evening ? __eou__ The kids said that they wanted to go to a party at the hotel . There ’ s a special one just for kids . __eou__ So , we could try that restaurant that was recommended in the guidebook . Then we could go to a club . We haven ’ t been to one for ages . __eou__ That ’ s a great idea . We can really enjoy ourselves without worrying about the kids . __eou__ Now , how about going for a swim in the sea ? We shouldn ’ t sunbathe all day . __eou__

They've got good ones now . __eou__ It's the same kind of deal though , you know , you never know what you're going to get . __eou__ Oh , hey , how about a new car ?

We seemingly need to gather money little by little . __eou__ What you said is absolutely right . I will pay you back as soon as I get back on my feet . __eou__ No rush . You can give it back whenever you have it . __eou__

I'm in the car business . __eou__ Salesman ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . And how about you ? __eou__ I work for American Airlines . __eou__ Oh , really ? What do you do there exactly ? __eou__ I'm in the Personnel Department . __eou__
It's terrible how things have changed . You remember there used to be trees on all these hills . __eou__ Really ? There aren't many left now . __eou__ No , they've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away . __eou__ Were there any animals in the forest ? __eou__ Yes , I can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . But nowadays you just don't see the birds that you used to see around here . __eou__
My son is alway complaining that I dump on him . He was very rude and told me to mind my own business . I cannot put up with that . __eou__ What does his dad say ? __eou__ John is a peacemaker . He simply doesn ’ t bother . He says he should give him a free hand . __eou__
You are married to a foreigner , huh ? So what ’ s it like ? __eou__ Well , the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulty getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts . __eou__ Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures . __eou__ And now we have a two-year-old boy . We ’ re very happy that he ’ s healthy and smart . __eou__ Oh , so he ’ s half Chinese and half American . That ’ s unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? __eou__ Right now he speaks mostly Chinese , and he can say a few English words . But he will learn . __eou__ What does he look like ? Can people tell ? __eou__ Yes , people surely can . He ’ s whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though . __eou__

Here ’ s your hot dog and beer . What happened ? Did I miss anything ? __eou__ Yeah , Cal Ripen just hit a home run . __eou__ What ’ s the score ? __eou__ Well it was 3 to 4 , but Ripen ’ s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base . __eou__ So Baltimore is winning ? __eou__ Right . __eou__ This is a really great place to watch a baseball game . __eou__ Yeah , there isn ’ t a bad seat in the place . __eou__ The fans are great here , too . Not like in Philadelphia . __eou__ It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game . __eou__ Yeah , it reminds you why they say baseball is America ’ s favorite pastime . __eou__
Well , it ’ s really too late . I have to go now . __eou__ Could you stay a little longer ? __eou__ Sorry , I can ’ t.My mother doesn ’ t want me to be late .

Our house is too small . We had better have a big one . __eou__ How could we ever manage to buy a big house when we are always living beyond our means ? __eou__ Shut up . You should think how to make fortunes , not look for a squabble . __eou__
Can we have dinner together sometime this weekend ? __eou__ Ok , you name the day . __eou__ How about the second of March ? __eou__ What day is that ? __eou__ It's Friday . __eou__ Good . Where shall we meet ? __eou__

Daniel , you can't spit the gum everywhere . __eou__ Come on , just a little piece . __eou__ Do you know how many people chew gum everyday ? __eou__ I have no idea . __eou__ Just in Beijing , people consume 300,000 pieces of gum every day . __eou__ That's amazing . __eou__ If all the people spit out the gum like you , the whole world would become a big trash can . __eou__ Come on , you are making too big deal out of this . __eou__ I just want to remind you to behave yourself . __eou__ OK , dear sister , I see . This kind of thing will not happen again . __eou__
Is my hair done yet ? __eou__ Yeah , I just need to make the final touches . __eou__ How long until you're finished ? __eou__ I'm finished .

Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet . __eou__ I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ? __eou__ My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ? __eou__ Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her . __eou__ You need a babysitter . __eou__ Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights . __eou__ I could have Suzy stay at my place . __eou__ I don't want to do that to you , Karen . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . __eou__ I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely . __eou__ I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight . __eou__ I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible . __eou__ I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older . __eou__ I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself . __eou__ Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free . __eou__
Did you hear what happened in the Scott case ? Some of the sensitive material were leaked to the press . Now every newspapers is all over it . __eou__ Oh ... I bet the firm is fuming . Do they know who spilled the beans ? __eou__ I'm sure they have their suspicions ; there were only a few of the senior level layers who were privy to the case details . __eou__ What kind of repercussions will there be for the people who are held responsible ? __eou__ I'm sure there'll be canned ! And there also might be some legal consequences . __eou__ Why would the person who told have problems with the law ? __eou__ Because whoever let the cat out of the bag was breaking client confidentiality . __eou__ I didn't think about that . That's pretty serious . Are there investigators working on finding out who it was ? __eou__ I'm sure management is on top of it . __eou__
You are not being a good sport about this . __eou__ That's because you cheated . __eou__ I never cheat . __eou__ Yes , you do . __eou__
Hi , I'm Lucas , I just moved in next door . __eou__ Oh , hi Lucas , come on in . I'm Barbara . Nice to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you too . __eou__ Would you like something to drink ? I've got tea and some grape juice . __eou__ Thanks . Some tea would be nice . Chinese tea is great . I really like your tea set . Where did you get it ? __eou__ Oh , there is a supermarket not far from here . But there is also a tea house around the corner , where you can get tea , taste tea and get a tea set as well . __eou__ Oh yeah , I saw the tea house the other day . I think I might go and have a look sometime . It's a nice neighborhood here . __eou__ You are right about that . It's quiet and very convenient . You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes ' walk . There's a grocery store , a book store , a gym , and many restaurants along the street . __eou__ There's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight . __eou__ Well , if you want we can go together sometime . Actually I was thinking of going this afternoon , if you like , you can join me and I can show you the neighborhood along the way . __eou__ That would be wonderful . Thanks ! __eou__
What ’ s your favourite ball sport ? __eou__ I like basketball . I really enjoy watching the NBA games on TV . __eou__ Who ’ s your favourite player ? __eou__ I don ’ t really have one but I support Huston . __eou__ Do they have a good team ? __eou__ I think they do , but I ’ m biased . They have a good manager and a great coach . __eou__ I can ’ t keep up with the game . The players play so quickly that I can hardly see what they are doing . __eou__ I have the same problem . The players are really very skilful . I wish I could play that well . __eou__ You play for an amateur team , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes , I do . We ’ re doing pretty well this season . We ’ Ve won most of our games , but we ’ re not top of the league table . __eou__ How many more games are there this season ? __eou__ We ’ Ve got four more games . I hope we can win all of them . __eou__
I'm sorry , but I can't go . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I have to see my daughter . __eou__ When poyou have to see her ? __eou__ I have an appointment at one fifteen . __eou__

Time flies ! __eou__ You're telling me . __eou__
How are you , Kim ? I haven ’ t seen you around for a few days . __eou__ Oh , I was out sick most of last week . I ’ m still not completely over it . You ’ d better not get too close ! __eou__ I ’ m sorry to hear about that . Why don ’ t you join me for a hot cup of tea ? It ’ ll be good for you ! __eou__ Sure , why not ? I could use a rest . __eou__
Hello , Mr . Brown , long time no see . Where have you been ? __eou__ Oh , I went on a holiday in the city of Chende . __eou__ Great . What do you think of it ? __eou__ The city is small , not very modern , but there are many mountains with lots of trees around the city , so the air there is pretty fresh . __eou__ Did you go to the Summer Mountain Resort ? __eou__ Certainly ! The most attractive place is that , it's very large ; it is 8 times the size of Forbidden City and 16 times the size of Summer Palace . The art of gardens is perfectly represented in it . __eou__ It sounds great , and is it really cool there ? __eou__ Yes , I think the reason is that there is a big lake , and many trees in the Resort . __eou__ What is the special local product ? __eou__ The main product of Chende is various kinds of ferine mushroom and the almond . The mushroom tastes really good , and it is very different from the common mushrooms , and the snack made of almond is delicious . __eou__ I hope to go there someday . __eou__
Gino , do you really need to go ? __eou__ Yeah , it's must for me . __eou__ But don't forget to give me a ring . __eou__ I won't , mom . __eou__ Take care of yourself . __eou__ I will . Bye , mom . __eou__ Bye , my boy . __eou__
John got a heart attack last night . __eou__ Oh really ? Is he all right ? __eou__ Not so good , though his nephew took him to hospital in time . __eou__ Poor old John ! I am ever so sorry . __eou__
Why are you always staring at Melissa ? Do you like her or something ? __eou__ Mind your own business . __eou__
Have you heard about the new iPhone ? __eou__ yes , I heard it's supposed to come out in June . Are you thinking about getting one ? __eou__ I'd like to . It's a cell phone , camera , PAD and mp3 player all in one . __eou__ if I had enough money , I'd buy one , but I don't even have enough to buy one of their shuffle spods . __eou__ how big is a shuffle iPod ? __eou__ the first generation iPod shuffle is about the size of a park of gum and the second generation iPod shuffle is about half the size of the first . __eou__ how many gigs of music can it hold ? __eou__ I think it's either one or two gigs . I can't remember . __eou__ how much do they cost ? __eou__ not much at all . I think it's about 100 dollars . __eou__ you're right , that's not bad at all . __eou__ do you have an iPod ? __eou__ I got one for my birthday when they first came out , but after the battery died out , I never brought another one . __eou__ why didn't you just buy another battery for it so you could use it ? __eou__ that's one of the problems with having an iPod . Though an iPod might have an above average battery life , once the battery is dead , so is your iPod . __eou__
You seem to like her very much , don't you ? __eou__ I can't deny that . She is so beautiful that I fell in love with her at the first sight . I wish I knew more about her . __eou__ But I heard that she had a three-year-old girl . __eou__ I can not belive that . It must be cooked up by someone . __eou__
Do you need help with something ? __eou__ I ’ m looking for this book . __eou__ Is there something wrong ? __eou__ I don ’ t see it on the shelf . __eou__ Did you check the computer ? __eou__ I already looked . __eou__ Did it say anything ? __eou__ It said that the book is on the shelf , but it isn ’ t . __eou__ I ’ m sure I can get it from another library . __eou__ Could you do that ? __eou__ I ’ ll let you know when I get the book in . __eou__ That ’ s great . Thank you so much . __eou__
Hello Bill , what's new ? __eou__ Bob and Mary are back together . __eou__ I'm glad to hear it . __eou__ Me too , they're such a nice couple . __eou__
Hey , Robert , what are you doing this weekend ? __eou__ I didn't have any big plans . __eou__ We are putting together a birthday party for Mary . __eou__ That sounds like fun . Where will it be ? __eou__ We thought it would be fun to have a pool party at Jay's house . __eou__ Oh good ! Can I bring anything ? __eou__ We will be providing hot dogs , hamburgers , and cake , but people can bring side dishes . __eou__ I am assuming that the dress is casual . __eou__ Dress casually and bring your bathing suit ! __eou__ Wonderful . Just e-mail me the time and date and I'll be there . __eou__
Jessica is going back to Holland next week . I've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift , but I still have no clue . __eou__ Is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with ? __eou__ Yeah , that's her . We had a lot of wonderful times together . She is really a special friend , and I want to get her something meaningful . __eou__ I am not good at picking gifts . Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ? __eou__ I don't think so . That way it would lose all the charm . I want it to be a surprise . I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last . __eou__ Yeah , that's nice . __eou__ Hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home . __eou__ A plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to get through the customs ? __eou__ I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border . __eou__ I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble . __eou__
Do you have any hobbies ? __eou__ Yes , I like collecting things . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s interesting , and but what kind of things ? __eou__ Several things , for example , Various coins , stamps , stones and so on . __eou__ Stones ? I know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ? __eou__ Yes , stones . __eou__ well , I can ’ t just image it . __eou__
We're going dancing tonight . __eou__ Count me out . __eou__
Good morning Mike ! __eou__ Morning Sally ! What's up ? you seem in a hurry ! __eou__ I am having an exam at nine , It's already eight thirty . __eou__ Don't worry , I'll drive you . __eou__ Thank you very much ! __eou__ How are your cases coming along ? __eou__ Very well , thanks , I will probably finish next week , but this is still a lot of work , I have been worked on in for six months , and i ' m so closed to end . I can feel it . __eou__ Wow , Good for you.It sounds like a lot of work . I'm proud of you ! Is this the right building ? __eou__ Yes , It's only eight forty . Thanks so much ! __eou__ You're welcome.Good luck , bye ! __eou__ Have a nice day , bye ! __eou__
Oh , Mary , come in , please . I'm so happy to see you . __eou__ Happy birthday , George . Many happy returns of the day . Here's a present for you . __eou__ Oh , thank you , Mary . You're so nice . __eou__ I hope you like it . Oh , have the other guys arrived ? __eou__ They're all waiting for you . Let's join them . I'm going to cut the cake soon . __eou__ Let's go . __eou__
When shooting a gun , accuracy is very important . __eou__ You only need to tell me that once . __eou__
John , why don ’ t you go and do some gardening ? The lawn needs weeding . __eou__ Because I ’ m not in the mood , that ’ s why . __eou__ Well , don ’ t just sit there , do something . Come and help me in the kitchen . __eou__ Help you in the kitchen , I don ’ t feel like it . __eou__ Would you like to clear the table then ? __eou__ Really ? Do I have to do it ? __eou__ Not , if you don ’ t want to . __eou__ Well , isn ’ t there anything you want ? __eou__ Yes , I want to go out . Would you like to come ? __eou__ No , why should I ? I don ’ t feel like it . Besides , I ’ m in such a bad mood . __eou__
I just heard that you won the long-distance race . Congratulations on your victory . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ So it is really worth your great effort . And hope you can keep the record you've made today . __eou__ I will try my best . __eou__
Oh , what a beautiful garden ! __eou__ These are my roses . The roses have been in flower for a week . __eou__ The garden looks lovely when the roses are in bloom . You must have a lot of pleasure in planting flowers . __eou__ Yes , you are right . I love flowers and hence have taken to growing them . I take care of my flowers every day as if they are my good friends . __eou__ You did a good job . But I got tired of working in the garden . __eou__ Oh , I see . People who don't understand the nature of flowers won't be able to grow them well . I can help you learn more if you want to plant flowers one day . In this way you need not be afraid of your own sweet flower-garden's being neglected . __eou__ Yes . Thanks . __eou__
Julia , why have you prepared a candlelight dinner ? Anything special to celebrate ? Did you get a promotion ? __eou__ Honey , don't tell me that you forgot our anniversary , did you ? __eou__ Oh , my dear , how can I forget such an important day ? I was just kidding . Look at this box . __eou__ What's in it ? __eou__ Have a guess . __eou__ A necklace ? __eou__ No . __eou__ I have no idea . __eou__ Open it now . __eou__ Oh , my god . A diamond brooch . It's so beautiful . You're so kind to me , A . Thank you ! __eou__ You're welcome , honey . I hope we will celebrate our golden wedding anniversary in future . __eou__
What do you say we stop in at that Burger King over there and grab a bite ? __eou__ Forget it ! If you think I ’ d ever set foot that inferior restaurant again , you gotta be nuts . Last time I ate that food , almost vomited . The service in there is terrible . It was the first time I ever stiffed a waiter __eou__ Yeah , not seeing a single person anywhere informed me . Hey ! How about that one over there ? __eou__ Oh , give me a break ! That place is too lavish for us . __eou__ Easy . It ’ s on me . __eou__ In that case , I ’ m right behind you . __eou__
what did you do over the weekend ? __eou__ I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . __eou__ do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? __eou__ it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . __eou__ like what ? __eou__ well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . __eou__ what else can we do to protect the environment ? __eou__ if you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . __eou__ how about recycling ? Does that actually help ? __eou__ yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . __eou__ what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ? __eou__ I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . __eou__ I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before ! __eou__ to be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . __eou__
Why are you going out with Andy ? __eou__ Because I like him . __eou__ Me , too . I think he ’ s really a shoulder to cry on . __eou__
Hi , Mikel . What's with you ? You look angry . __eou__ No , I just check my weight , I'm getting fatter . __eou__ True , you are getting a really pot belly , aren't you ? __eou__ I'll get you for that comments , George . __eou__ Just kidding , Mikel . Why don't you come work out with me ? __eou__ ah , I don't know a fit works . Last time , all I saw the gym were bunch of lidos , like me . __eou__ It works if you keep at it . Come on , let's go ! __eou__ All right . But so help me it's a better work . __eou__ This feels great . I'm all reed up . I can keep going all night . __eou__ Not me . I'm too hot and I'm too tired . __eou__ Exercise has no benefit unless you sweat like a pig . __eou__ Well , that's not for me . __eou__ Thanks for coming , it was a real blessed . __eou__ It wasn't as good as you think . __eou__ You'll get used to it , Mikel , trust me . __eou__
Good morning , Miss Wang . How beautiful you look today ! __eou__ Thank you . I'm wearing make-up . __eou__ Who taught you to put on make-up ? __eou__ It's me . I have studied make-up at a beauty shop . __eou__ Can you teach me how to do make-up ? __eou__ Of course . First , use eye shadow to heighten your eyes . __eou__ What eye shadow do you think is the most fit for me ? __eou__ I think pink eye shadow is popular among Chinese girls . __eou__ How do you protect yourself from chapped lips ? __eou__ I suggest you use lipstick , which also accentuates your lips . __eou__ How did you grow such long nails ? __eou__ You have to pay attention to trimming them from time to time . __eou__
Oh Gush ! The first day of my career is over . I can not breathe now after dealing with so many documents . But I heard the notice that our company will hold two-week staff training . __eou__ Stop fussing ! It is said that the training is important for our newcomers . And my company also informs me to attend the training next week . __eou__ But for me , the training is waste of my precious time . __eou__ I disagree with you . Companies usually make a workable and reasonable plan for the trainings , so as to improve new comers ' understanding of the company and its rules in short time . Through the training , we get to know many things , such as the corporate culture and spirit . Our newcomers can really grasp the essence of the company __eou__
You look like being on cloud nine . __eou__ I am . __eou__ What has made you so happy ? __eou__ I think I'm in love . __eou__ Are you ? Who's the lucky girl ? __eou__ Her name is Jenny . __eou__ How did you meet her ? __eou__ We are in the same math class . Our teacher sat us next to each other . __eou__ What do you like best about her ? __eou__ She's very funny . She makes me laugh all the time . __eou__ I guess it was fate working to bring you together . __eou__ Whatever brought us together , I'm happy . __eou__
How will you spend this lovely weekend ? __eou__ I have no idea , any suggestions ? __eou__ We haven't played chess for a long time . How about playing chess ? __eou__ It must be fun . But you know , I am not good at chess . I never won since I've learnt to play chess . __eou__ Don ’ t worry , I will teach you how to win . __eou__ OK , settled then . __eou__ See you tomorrow . __eou__ See you ! __eou__
Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ? __eou__ Cinct de mayo ? __eou__ No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day . __eou__ Do we get a day off from school then ? __eou__ No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is . __eou__ Www , man ! __eou__ In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect . __eou__ Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ? __eou__ Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality . __eou__ And then what happened ? __eou__ Well , as we say , the rest is history ... __eou__
What's that book you have under your arm ? __eou__ It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months . __eou__ How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn . __eou__ I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day . __eou__ Is it really worth paying for ? __eou__ I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter . __eou__ If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition . __eou__
Hey Lucas , how was your trip to Paris ? __eou__ It was wonderful , but I was so tired . __eou__ Did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower . __eou__ Yes , that was the first thing we did . We went all the way to the top . There were visitorsfrom all over the world taking photos there . __eou__ What else did you see ? __eou__ Art galleries , cathedrals , statues , fountains , palaces , bistros , there's really too much to say . __eou__ You must have had a great time . __eou__ Yes , at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However , on the third day of travelling in the city , I felt sick I think I had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening . __eou__ Yes . you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad.sometimes new food might disagree with you . __eou__ On the fourth day , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic . And no stomach problems . __eou__ That is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful . __eou__ You'll have to try for yourself some day . __eou__
You have your ducks in a row . __eou__ Thank you very much . I will devote all my efforts to my work . __eou__
Were you born in the U . S . , Melissa ? __eou__ No , I wasn't . I came here in 1992 . __eou__ How old were you ? __eou__ I was seventeen . __eou__ So , did you go to college right away ? __eou__ No , because my English wasn't very good . I studied English for two years first . __eou__ Wow , your English is really fluent now . __eou__ Thanks . Your English is pretty good , too . __eou__ Yeah , but I was born here ! ! __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , would you like to tell me what's playing for tonight ? __eou__ Sure . There is a folk concert tonight . __eou__ Are there any good seats left ? __eou__ Sorry . There are only some seats in the back . __eou__ Well , what time does it begin ? __eou__ It begins at 7 p . m .. __eou__ OK . I see . __eou__ How many tickets do you want ? __eou__ Just two . __eou__ OK . Fifty yuan for each . __eou__ Here is the money . __eou__
We have a live show of a football match this Friday night . __eou__ What're the teams ? __eou__ Brazilian against AC Millan . __eou__ I bet AC Milan will lose . __eou__
How time flies ! Why I always feel haven't enough time to work and study ? __eou__ Yes , I also felt that . I'm always busy , and have no time for rest . I don ’ t know how to make use of time . __eou__ Maybe we should make a plan and list what we should do next , and follow it . __eou__ That's a good idea . And in this way we will know how we spend our time and spare a lot of time to do other things . __eou__ You are right . Let ’ s stop idling around and do something . __eou__ Yeah , time is money . We really need to make good use of it . __eou__
Hi dude , you look upset , what's up ? __eou__ haven't been sleeping well recently . __eou__ what's the problem ? __eou__ every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night . I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings . __eou__ well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an arrangement for a time when the room should quiet down . __eou__ yeah , I know , but I find these sorts of things hard to say . They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV . Now I just hope the show will end soon . __eou__ I understand . I used to live in a dorm with four people . I was great in some aspects . We always went out and and had fun together . But on the other hand , when I wanted some quiet time , and people kept __eou__ yeah , I crave my own space . i just so tired of having people around me all time . __eou__
I'd better be going . __eou__ So soon ? Why don't you stay a little longer ? __eou__ I wish I could , but it's already late . __eou__ Oh , it's a pity that you have to leave . __eou__ Thank you for a wonderful meal . __eou__ I'm glad you enjoyed it . __eou__
Are you an American ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Why don't you speak English ? __eou__ Oh , my mother is a German , so I can speak German . __eou__ Oh , do you like Chinese ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm eager to learn Chinese , but it is too difficult for me . __eou__ I want to study German . Can we exchange lessons ? __eou__ Very Good . I'd like to do that . __eou__ When will we begin ? __eou__ How about tomorrow night ? __eou__ That's all right . __eou__
You seem depressed these days . What's the matter ? __eou__ I went bankrupt and I'm flat broke now . __eou__ If I can do anything for you , don't hesitate to let me know . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
You ’ re all set now ? __eou__ Oh , thank you so much . __eou__ Really , it was nothing . __eou__ I really appreciated it . __eou__ I was happy to help . __eou__ It was so kind of you . __eou__ Don ’ t mention it . __eou__ You ’ re a real friend in need . __eou__
Haven't seen you for a long time __eou__ I've been away on a vacation . __eou__ I bet you had a wonderful time __eou__ Yeah , beautiful sunshine , pleasant scenery and many new friends __eou__ Sounds great __eou__
I hear you have just shown your hand first to Lin Ping . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ If I were in your position , I wouldn't give up an inch . __eou__ I regret to say I can't accept your suggestion . __eou__
Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ? __eou__ Yes . I am going for a hike around the Qinghai Lake . __eou__ Oh , do you go hiking often ? __eou__ I go as much as I can . I love hiking , because you can really get in touch with nature . __eou__ It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ? __eou__ Sure . But it will be a long hike 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? __eou__ Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a lion on my last hike . __eou__ Wow . You must have been pretty far away from the city . __eou__ Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest . __eou__ Well , bring him along to . We will have a great time this weekend . __eou__ Thanks . I will ask him . __eou__
Has the game started yet ? __eou__ Yeah , about 5 minutes ago . __eou__ Who's winning ? __eou__ The Bulls , of course ! __eou__ What ! That wasn't a foul ! C ’ mon , ref ! __eou__ Don ’ t worry , Shan always screws up free throws . __eou__ You were right ! He didn ’ t make the shot ! __eou__ That was a great shot ! A three pointer , yeah ! __eou__ Did you see that ? He traveled and the ref didn ’ t call it ! __eou__ This ref needs glasses . Hey ref , open your eyes ! I can ’ t believe he didn ’ t see that ! __eou__ Okay ... end of the first quarter ... Alright , I ’ m gonna make a beer run . __eou__
I heard that Kevin got divorced . Is that true ? __eou__ Not so bad , but Kevin does have problems with his wife . __eou__ What ? __eou__ His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion . __eou__ Poor Kevin , we should do something for him . He is a nice guy and does his job well . __eou__ Yeah , I agree with you . But you know , it's just one of those things . __eou__
Honey , do you know what color the carrot is ? __eou__ Mom , it's orange ? __eou__ Wow , my son is so clever . __eou__ Mom , that's a stupid question . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ I am not a child at all . I know more . __eou__ Oh , my son looks like a grown-up . __eou__ Sure . Mom , I can take care of you . __eou__ No kidding . So tell me what's your favorite color ? __eou__ I like blue . You see , that's the color of the sky . I wanna be a superman . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I hope I can fly to any place like superman . So I can touch the sky . __eou__ OK , superman . Put on your cape , we are going to fly home . __eou__
Thanks for inviting me to work out with you , Joan . __eou__ Don't mention it , let's go in . __eou__ Yeah , this place looks great . Wow , look at her , she can certainly get down , can't she ? __eou__ She sure can . Are you jealous , Leslie ? __eou__ A little , I wish I could do that . __eou__ You can ! With a little practice . __eou__ Look at him , he's buff . __eou__ I think he's hot too . __eou__ How do they all get in such tiptop shape ? __eou__ Exercised over and over . Exercise is a key . __eou__ That's it . I decided to turn over a new leaf . I'm going to exercise every single day . __eou__ Good for you , Leslie ! __eou__
wow , it that your sports car ? __eou__ yes , do you like it ? __eou__ I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ? __eou__ it looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again . __eou__ what's wrong with it ? __eou__ well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive . __eou__ when's the last time you had it serviced ? __eou__ it must have been a few years ago now . __eou__ I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis . __eou__ they do . Once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater , you know ! __eou__ what else is wrong with it ? __eou__ the heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer ! __eou__ anything else ? __eou__ the brakes don't really work that well anymore either . __eou__ why don't you get it all fixed ? __eou__ it costs more than you think to run a car , especially when there are so many things wrong with it ! __eou__ well , let me know when you can get it fixed . I ’ d love to go for a ride in it ! __eou__
Hello , Kith , can you and Alice come around this evening ? We prefer your coming . __eou__ I think we would be able to make it . What time shall we come ? __eou__ About 7 o'clock . __eou__ Shall we bring any thing ? Some wine ? __eou__ No , not really . Just bring yourselves . We would like to your presence . __eou__
Hello . May I speak to Mary , please ? __eou__ Speaking . Who's calling , please ? __eou__ Hi , Mary . This is Tom . __eou__ Oh , hi , Tom . How've you been ? __eou__ Just fine . I say .

Uh-huh ... no , I guess I'll be free . __eou__ Well , uh ... why not dine out together and go to the movies ? __eou__ Sounds like a good idea . __eou__ Okay . I'll pick you up at 6:00 . __eou__ Thank you for inviting me . See you then . Bye , Tom . __eou__
Well , my particular interest is collecting stamps , especially the rare ones . What about you ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid that ’ s not my cup of tea . I just find skin-diving attracting . __eou__ So have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ? __eou__
There are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from ! __eou__ Yes , there must be about a hundred . Do you have a favorite ? __eou__ I love fruit flavored ices the best . __eou__ I know , fresh fruit flavored is the best ever . __eou__ What is your least favorite ice cream ? __eou__ I don't like peppermint ice cream . __eou__ Yeah , I know what you mean . __eou__ One time , I tried garlic ice cream . __eou__ That could be interesting . __eou__ That doesn't sound like a good choice for today though . Let's order ! __eou__
I don't want to do the damn dishes . __eou__ Watch your language or you'll be spending the weekend in your room . __eou__
Good morning , Paul ! __eou__ Hi , good morning , you are so early today . __eou__ Yes , traffic wasn't much today , so I made it to the office earlier . __eou__ I see . How long does it take you to reach the office every day ? __eou__ Well , about an hour or so . __eou__ Wow , that ’ s quite a long journey . Do you drive a car ? __eou__ No . I take public transportation . It's safer . __eou__ You are right ! But I get up a little late . That gives me no other option but to travel by motorcycle . __eou__ Well , both have advantages and disadvantages . __eou__
I usually get a lot of information on the computer and use E-mail to send messages to my friends . __eou__ Me too.Recently , I'm fascinated with net-chat . I've made many friends on the net.Every day I talk to them and share many interesting things with them . I really enjoy it . __eou__ Don't you think it ' s a sheer waste of both time and money ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . Every coin has two sides . I think using internet has a great deal to do with human interaction . __eou__
Do you believe in UFO's ? __eou__ Sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs . __eou__ I've never thought about it like that before . __eou__ I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up . __eou__ Do you think that there's life on other planets ? __eou__ I think there must be . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world . The world is just far too big for that . __eou__ Do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ? __eou__ No , but we're trying to contact them . __eou__ I suppose you're right . __eou__ I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet , humankind will not become extinct . __eou__ Do you really think that global warming Wil destroy Earth some day ? __eou__ There's a lot of evidence that suggest it will , but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon . __eou__
What do you think of shopping ? __eou__ I don't mind shopping for food and other daily needs . __eou__ What do you think of big department store ? __eou__ It's fun walking around them , but their displays are so good I'm tempted to buy things I don't really need . __eou__
Nice and warm again , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Oh , it ’ s lovely . Think of the nasty weather we had last week . __eou__ How are you these days ? __eou__ Fine , thank you . And you ? __eou__ Fine today , though a bit under the weather last week . __eou__
Martha . What's wrong ? Why are you crying ? __eou__ Jake just broke up with me . __eou__ I'm sorry . When did this happen ? __eou__ Yesterday . I didn't even know it was coming . He just told me he found someone else . __eou__ What a jerk . He doesn't deserve you . __eou__ But it still hurts . I thought I loved him . __eou__ He didn't treat you that well either . Maybe you don't want to hear this , but I think you can do better . __eou__ Better or worse , it doesn't matter . I had a lot of feelings for him . I really liked him __eou__ It must be really painful . I remember when Josh and I broke up . I was crying for a week . __eou__ I know . I'll get over him . My first break up was painful because I was naive . __eou__ Exactly . You'll find someone again . You should get your mind off of this . Let's go shopping . __eou__ Maybe tomorrow . I don't feel like it tonight . __eou__ How about coffee down the street ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__
I got a ninety-five on my test . __eou__ So what ? I got a ninety-nine . __eou__
How can you keep in touch with your aunt in America ? __eou__ Oh , I make a phone call once a month . __eou__ It's very expensive , right ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Why not send E-mail through the Internet ? __eou__ Is it convenient and cheap ? __eou__ Sure . You can send E-mail to each other every day through the internet . In addition , you can make a phone call through the internet , too . __eou__ Really ? I'm so glad to hear that.But I don't know how to get access to the Internet.Could you show me ? __eou__ No problem . I'll tell you . __eou__ I'll appreciate it very much . __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I need to apply for a parking permit . __eou__ Are you a professor ? __eou__ What ? Are you kidding ? I'm only 22 years old ! __eou__ Yes , I am kidding.But don't you know only professors and students with disabilitiescan apply for parking permits ? __eou__ Yes , I know . I have a disability.My hip was broken last year . And I can't walk well . __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't know . __eou__ It's alright . You didn't see me walk to the desk . __eou__ Here is the application form . I also need to see your student ID and your permission letter from the university . __eou__ My permission letter ? __eou__ Yes , the letter that certifies you have a disability.And it must certify your disability entitles you to a parking place . __eou__ I was told I should have the letter sent directly to your office . __eou__ Yes . Or you can bring it yourself . __eou__ But I asked them to send it to you directly . __eou__ Let me look in the file then . Maybe we received it . __eou__ My name is Derek Schneider , S - C - H - N - E - I - D - E - R . __eou__ Yes , here it is.Alright . Then I just need your completed application form , and I will be able to process your request . __eou__ Good . I will sit over there and fill out the form . I will give it to you in a few minutes.Oh , by the way , can I apply for any parking lot I want ? __eou__ The form has a map on the back . You may specify your top four choices.We will give a spot in the lot that has an opening . __eou__ I see . Thank you . __eou__ You're very welcome . __eou__
It's too hot to read . __eou__ We'd better go out for a walk . __eou__ Which season do you like best ? __eou__ Spring . __eou__ How about summer ? __eou__ I dislike it most . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because the hottest season is summer in a year . __eou__ But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons . __eou__
Will you be at the family reunion next year ? __eou__ Yes , we'll be there , come hell or high water ! __eou__
I watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . It was called “ unusual plants ” and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features . __eou__ Really ? Tell me about some of the plants they showed . __eou__ Well . There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them . __eou__ Is that type of plant found in this country ? __eou__ No , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because I ’ d like to see it in action . __eou__ So would I . what other unusual plants did they show ? __eou__ They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . Other insects cannot get it . Of course , when the insect collects the nectar , it also takes some pollen from one flower to another . __eou__ That ’ s very specialized . So , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . If one became extinct , the other would too . __eou__ That ’ s right . That ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species . __eou__ I see . The plants that fascinate me most are cacti . I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions . __eou__ According to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation . __eou__ That ’ s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves , to reduce water loss . __eou__
I have some good news for you . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Jenny is getting married . __eou__ Great ! Who's the bridegroom ? __eou__ Tom , that lucky guy . __eou__ The guy always hands the girls in a line . When did he propose ? __eou__ Last week , It said that he fell in love with Jenny at Mrs.Whit ' s party last Monday as soon as he saw her . __eou__ My gosh ! How romantic ! When's the big day ? __eou__ July 4 , the National Holiday . __eou__ Will it be a church wedding or a civil ceremony ? __eou__ Jenny plans to hold it in church . __eou__ Who is the best man ? __eou__ Guess ! __eou__ Nobody is OK , but you ! __eou__ You know , Tom is my best friend and he asked me to be his best man . __eou__ Did you promise him ? __eou__ Yes , I did . __eou__
Ben , what are you doing ? __eou__ Well , I would say that I ’ m just drifting - - here , in the pool . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Well , it ’ s very comfortable just to drift here . __eou__ Have you thought about graduate school ? __eou__ No . __eou__ Would you mind telling me then — what were those four years of college for ? What was the point of all that hard work ? __eou__ You got me . __eou__ Now listen , Ben . Look , I think it ’ s a very good thing that a young man — after he ’ s done some very good work — should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself , and lie around , and drink beer and so on . But after a few weeks I believe that person should want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass . __eou__
Peter , have you finished your English composition ? __eou__ No . But I ’ m working on it . __eou__ Class starts in twenty minutes . You have to turn it in at the beginning of class today . __eou__ I know . I know ! __eou__ Do you think you can finish it on time ? __eou__ Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll get it done very soon . I ’ m almost finished . __eou__ You ’ d better hurry ! __eou__ Well , it would be a lot easier to finish if you stopped talking to me . __eou__ Sorry ! __eou__
How many orders do we still need to pack , Gale ? We've been packing all day . __eou__ We still have to do about ten more . __eou__ Well . I am really tired from packing all of the stuff all day . And it's about time to clock out . __eou__ I know . Maybe we can finish it tomorrow . __eou__ Why not ! These orders are not urgent . We could do it first thing tomorrow morning __eou__ All right . Let's call it quits and go home . __eou__ See . Great minds think alike . __eou__
Tom , did you see the film last night ? __eou__ Yes , I did , I thought it was a failure . __eou__ Do you really think so ? I don't think so . It wasn't that bad film at all . Didn't you hear the applause of the audience ? __eou__ Well , maybe so . But I still think everyone has their rights of their own opinion . __eou__ Well , I don't see the point of arguing this . __eou__
Are you OK ? __eou__ Yeah . Why not ? __eou__ Because ... I heard John got married yesterday . __eou__ Oh , you went to the wedding ? __eou__ No , he didn't tell me about it . Don't feel bad . __eou__ I'm OK . I promise . Maybe you don't know that I have done with him for a long time . __eou__
How do I apply to an American university ? __eou__ You should go to the library to find some information about American universities , and write to the Admission Office . Then the Admission Office will send you application forms and other related materials . From experience , many applicants write to several universities instead of just one . __eou__ I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply . __eou__ That is true . I'll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It's usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars . __eou__ What's to come next ? __eou__ If they agree to enroll you , they will send you a TAP - 66 Form . With TAP - 66 , you can apply for a passport from our government , and then apply for a visa from the US Embassy in Beijing . __eou__ How long will it take to go over all the procedures ? __eou__ From 3 to 6 months if everything goes well . __eou__ Thank you . I appreciate all your help . __eou__ You are welcome . Please feel free to ask if you have any more questions . __eou__
Well , speak of the devil . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I was just thinking about you the other day . __eou__ You were ? __eou__
Mom , you know that Andrea and I sometimes worry about you . __eou__ Really ? Why would you worry about me ? I ’ m just fine . __eou__ You ’ re almost 70 years old , Mom ! Don ’ t you think it would be better for you if you moved in with us ? __eou__ No way ! I like my apartment , and I like to be independent . __eou__ Do you ever get lonely living alone ? __eou__ Not at all . I see you and your family twice a week , and I enjoy seeing my own friends . I ’ m too busy to feel lonely ! __eou__
Do you have any plans for Veteran ’ s Day ? __eou__ You mean Armistice Day . __eou__ Well , as you know , on November 11th the allies signed a peace treaty with the Germans , also known as the Armistice Treaty . This marked the end of WWI and many countries around the world commemorate this date under names such as Remembers ’ Day . In Poland it ’ s their independence day ! There ’ s a lot going on around the world on this day . __eou__ Wow , I didn ’ t know ! Probably because I flunked history in school . __eou__
Are you sure you heard right ? __eou__ Yes , he is running for class president . __eou__ I don't believe you . __eou__ Take my word for it . __eou__
These days my son has turned his computer into an electronic playground . He plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other things on the computer . The funny thing about it is that , no matter what he plays , he always wins first place . I wonder if he'll be able to cope with a defeat in real life . __eou__ Don't worry . He'll cross that bridge when he comes to it . My son reads a lot on his computer and uses e-mail to send messages to his friends almost every day . He's really absorbed by the discussions . __eou__ That's exactly like my wife . She spends at least two hours a day on the computers discussing things ranging from stock prices to soft-ware standards . __eou__ I guess using a computer has a great deal to do with human interaction . Getting in touch with each other must be more fun to your wife and my son than the coolest computer games or the hottest information . __eou__
I'll participate in a quiz about the 29th Olympic Games in Beijing . It will be held tonight . Will you come ? __eou__ Sure . What do you know about the Olympic Games on the past ? For example , do you know where and when the first Olympic Games were held in the ancient times ? __eou__ It was held in 776 B . C . at Olympia . It also has a long history of more than 2700 years . __eou__ Haven't the Olympics been stopped for a long time ? __eou__ Yes , there were no games in 1916 , 1940 and 1944 , because of World War I and World War II . __eou__ I see . Look , do you know what that emblem means ? I've seen it so many times , but I don't know what it stands for . __eou__ Oh , it's the Beijing 2008 Olympics ' Emblem . It's a Chinese seal , meaning that Chinese people warmly welcome the friends from all over the world . __eou__ I see . I believe there will be lots of foreigners coming to Beijing to watch the Games . __eou__ Sure . __eou__
I plan to buy a car this year . __eou__ How do you pay for it ? __eou__ I'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments . __eou__ Tell me if you need help . __eou__
What's your favorite season ? __eou__ I like the freedom of summer with no school . __eou__ Yeah , and all those fun summer sports and activities . __eou__ And I like the festivities of winter with Thanksgiving , Christmas and New Year . __eou__ Oh , me too ! All the family getting together ... __eou__ And I really like the smells and colors of spring . __eou__ I like the feeling then that school is almost over ! __eou__ But I must say , if it were only for the weather , I like autumn most ! __eou__
One of my students told me she was very depressed today . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Her father is dying . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s very sad . __eou__ Yeah , she ’ s broken up about it , poor kid . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I talked to her for a while , but she ’ s really depressed . So , I made an appointment with the school counselor for her . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . The counselor is a psychologist . He ’ s better trained to handle these sorts of things . __eou__ Yeah , that ’ s what I told her . I ’ m glad she ’ s reaching out for help , instead of trying to deal with this on her own . __eou__ Yeah , me too . __eou__
It ’ s rather cold . Isn ’ t it __eou__ Oh . Yes . It is __eou__ Shall I light the stove ? __eou__ That ’ s a good idea __eou__ Well . What ’ s the climate like in your country ? __eou__ It ’ s mild . but it ’ s not always pleasant . __eou__ Which season do you like best ? __eou__ I like spring . The days are long and the nights are short . The flowers in blew . We go on picnics __eou__
Good afternoon , Sam . __eou__ Good afternoon , Tina . __eou__ What are you going to do tomorrow ? __eou__ I'm not sure yet . And you ? __eou__ I would like to go skating . Feel like going with me ? __eou__ Is skating interesting ? __eou__ I think so . Fresh air , white snow . It's so comfortable . __eou__ But I can't skate well . __eou__ It doesn't matter , I can teach you . __eou__ It's very kind of you . __eou__
Can you play tennis ? __eou__ Yes , I can . __eou__ It is interesting , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it's very interesting . __eou__ Can you teach me ? __eou__ Sure . Take the tennis racket . Now , throw the ball up , and hit it with the racket . Like this . __eou__ Let me try . Oh , I missed ! __eou__ Throw the ball up high . __eou__ High ? __eou__ Yes , very high . Over your head . Then you will have time to hit the ball . __eou__ Oh ! I hit it . __eou__ Well done ! __eou__ Thank you . I think I like playing it . __eou__
What was the party like last night , Jean ? __eou__ Not bad at all , thanks . There were one or two interesting people there.Why couldn't you come ? __eou__ Well , I couldn't get away from work early . And when . I got home I had a headache , so I had to go straight to bed . But I was over-tired , because I wasn't able to get to sleep for hours . __eou__ What a shame . Why didn't you take a sleeping pill ? __eou__ I don't like them . I used to take them when I had to work overtime , you know . __eou__ How many did you use to take ? __eou__ Three every night . __eou__ Good heavens . Why did you take so many ? __eou__ Because I was under a terrible strain . The doctor saidthey weren't very strong . Anyway , I used to feel awful the next morning . __eou__ I'm sure you did . __eou__ The doctor said I had to be careful . __eou__ He was quite right . __eou__ So I stopped drinking coffee late at night instead . __eou__
What a beautiful view . __eou__ It sure is . The Grand Canyon is truly a masterpiece . No man could ever make anything like this . __eou__ What is that below ? __eou__ It is the Colorado River . You can go down the river in a boat if you wish . __eou__ No . Thank you . It looks a bit too dangerous for me . __eou__ There is a beautiful state park here . I can see why so many people come out here to camp . __eou__ Yes , there is beautiful view . You can go fishing , camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air . __eou__ It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city . __eou__ That's true . __eou__
I would like you to meet my family . Can you come to dinner next week at my parents ' place ? __eou__ Yeuks ! Do they know anything about me ? __eou__ Actually , I've told them a lot about you . They are excited to meet you . __eou__ I'm a little nervous ! __eou__ I think you'll like them . My family is pretty laid back . __eou__ How Ay people will be there at dinner ? __eou__ Let's see . there's my mom and dad and my two brothers and one of my sisters . __eou__ That's good , I'm usually more comfortable in bigger families . __eou__

I like the culture . __eou__ Right.It ' s important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well . __eou__ You're right . __eou__
Judy , your husband has a really nice car . __eou__ Thanks . It's a lot better than mine , and it's new . __eou__ Where are you going ? __eou__ We're going to visit my sister in the city . __eou__ I didn't know your sister lives in the city , when did she move there ? __eou__ About a year ago . She lives in an apartment on 3rd street , across from the public library . __eou__ I see . It's almost 5:00 PM now , don't you think there will be a lot of traffic ? __eou__ Oh , we're not driving . We're going to take the subway . The subway only takes about 20 minutes . __eou__ Yes , but it can be very crowded around this time . I always feel uncomfortable taking the subway . __eou__ I take the subway to work everyday , so I'm used to it now . __eou__ Doesn't your mother live in the city ? __eou__ Yes , she's lived there for about ten years . __eou__ I remember when she moved there . Apartments were a lot cheaper then . __eou__ I know what you mean . It's hard to find anything that's reasonable now . __eou__ Have a good time . Next time you're free , give me a call and we'll go play poker . __eou__ See you later . __eou__
The time has come to say goodbye . __eou__ So soon . It seems as if you just got here . __eou__ I feel that way , too . But all good things must come to an end , as they say . __eou__ It certainly has been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories . __eou__ I've had a great time and thank you for your spending so much time showing me around . __eou__ It was fun for me , too . It gave me a chance to get away from my routine . __eou__ You'll be out to see me next year , as you promised ? __eou__ Oh , yes .

I don't think the lecture is very interesting . __eou__ The lecturer is dull , too . __eou__ I feel he's like a talking machine . __eou__ I feel the same way . __eou__
And lightweight , too . It'll play for 20 hours on two AA batteries ! __eou__ Cool ! The sound is great . These earphones are awesome ! __eou__ And they're really safe . They'll protect your ear from sound damage . __eou__ You certainly need that . You always pump the volume up way too high . __eou__ I know . And you can also hear outside noises while you listen to music . __eou__ You're right ! So I can listen to music while riding my motorbike ! __eou__
You're spending a very long time on my hair . __eou__ I'm almost done . __eou__ I needed you to be done and finished an hour ago . __eou__ I'm all done now . __eou__ Are you sure you're finished ? __eou__ I don't understand . __eou__ You did a horrible job on my hair . __eou__ What's wrong with it ? __eou__ I don't like anything about it . __eou__ I apologize . __eou__ That's fine , but I'm not paying for it . __eou__ Excuse me ? Let's try to work this out , okay ? __eou__
Excuse me . Have you got the time ? __eou__ My watch says half past five . __eou__ Does your watch keep good time ? __eou__ Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__
Do you think discrimination against women in the work force is still prevalent even today ? __eou__ From my own experience as a career woman , I would have to say that while things are getting better now than they used to be , it is still a widespread problem . Society is changing , but there is still a glass ceiling for women in many career tracks . __eou__ do you think the glass ceiling phenomena is because of traditional social customs ? Or are there more issues coming into play ? __eou__ I think it's a very complicated issue . A part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers . Don't underestimate the good ole ' boy system . Men have power , so it's easier for them to stay in power . __eou__ What about affirmative action ? Hasn't legislation changed a lot of the make hierarchy ? __eou__ Affirmative action has given us management quotas and bans sexual discrimination , but it's still a man's world . __eou__
Emily , what kind of report is this ? __eou__ What do you mean , Mr . Smith ? You said to make it brief . __eou__ Don't get smart with me . Here , do it again , but do it right this time . __eou__
Would you like some more rice ? __eou__ No , thanks . I'm full . __eou__
He has to deliver letters every day . __eou__ Poor man , he must be terribly fed up with it . __eou__ Oh , no , he likes the job . __eou__ Oh , Really ? __eou__
Good morning golf aficionados ! My name is Rick Fields , and you guessed it , I am here with my main man , Bob Copeland . __eou__ Thank you , Rick ! As you can see , ladies and gentleman , we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars ! __eou__ Whoa , that ’ s a lot of cash ! Let ’ s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing . __eou__ All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ’ s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole ! __eou__ Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous . __eou__ Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot . __eou__ It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it . __eou__ Oh no ! A bear ! Run , Tiger , run ! Somebody call animal control ! __eou__
I haven't seen Bill lately . How is he ? __eou__ He's still pretty sick . __eou__ That's too bad . What does he have ? __eou__ We don't know , but he's going to the doctor tomorrow . __eou__ Let me know if there's anything I can do . __eou__ Thanks a lot . I'll tell him . __eou__
Professor , I'm concerned about my grades . Do you have a minute ? __eou__ Of course , how can I help you ? __eou__ I want to know if I am doing OK . __eou__ Let's pull out your scores so far . Do you think you are doing OK ? __eou__ I am afraid that I might not be doing all that well . __eou__ I'm seeing that you are doing OK in some areas , but not so well in others . __eou__ I think I could take better notes and read a little more . __eou__ You can greatly improve your grades by always reflecting on what you can improve on . __eou__ I'm working on it ! __eou__ Just do your best and I am sure that you will see improvement . __eou__
Lisa , I am told you did very well in your exam . __eou__ I was the only one who got a strait A in my class . __eou__ Congratulations on your success . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Good morning , madam . I'd like to apply for a library card . Can you help me ? __eou__ Yes . Please give me your ID card , a photo . __eou__ OK . Here you are . __eou__ Then you have to give me 15 dollars for the deposit . The library card is free . __eou__ OK . Here is the money . And If I return the card , can I get the refund ? __eou__ Of course , as long as the card is well kept . __eou__ OK . I see . Thank you . __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__
Mr . Clinton , it's nice to see you again . __eou__ Nice to see you again , too . Peter . How's your family ? __eou__ Very well . How's Mrs . Clinton ? __eou__ Not bad . But she's as busy as before . __eou__
how did your interview go ? __eou__ pretty well .

Who interviewed you ? __eou__ my boss . __eou__ what kinds of questions did she ask you ? __eou__ she asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be . __eou__ the second one sounds rather difficult to answer . What did you tell her ? __eou__ I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally . __eou__ those are good answers . How did she react ? __eou__ she told me that even when I become a senior engineer , I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team . __eou__ what do you think about her as a boss ? __eou__ she's pretty easy to get along with . She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally . __eou__ you're lucky . Not everyone has such a great boss ! __eou__ that's true . She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company . __eou__ when you find out you get the promotion or not , let me know . __eou__ I will do . __eou__

There are advertisements everywhere here in hong kong . The city is so bright at night , with all the neon signs . __eou__ I like it . It makes the city feel alive . I like all the different colors and I like the billboards with eye-catching pictures and slogans . __eou__ I think that there are too many of them . I think that companies spend far too much money on advertising . They should have lower prices instead . Then they would see more . __eou__ I see your point , but if companies didn ’ t spend money on advertising , no one would hear about their products . I agree that some form of advertising can be annoying . I don ’ t like it when people try to give you leaflets with information about products you have no intention of buying . __eou__ I really hate receiving spam . I also dislike having to listen to advertisements and jingles when they are broadcast in stores or on the subway . __eou__ Yes , that annoys me too . With billboards , you can look away , but with broadcasts , you can ’ t avoid them . I like the way that advertising agencies use comedy in their campaign . __eou__ I like that too . I don ’ t like the way that advertising campaign often tell you if you don ’ t buy a certain product , you ’ re not cool or modern or efficient or something . __eou__ That kind of advertising seems to be very common with brand name products . They are always trying to maintain brand loyalty . __eou__

She's very nice . __eou__ don't worry.You won't be sitting there by yourself . __eou__ what time is it going to start ? __eou__ most people are working Friday night , so it's going to start around 9 pm . __eou__ should I bring anything ? __eou__ we'll have beer and snacks , but if you want to bring a bottle of wine , that'd be great . __eou__ I could also bring some music if you want . I've got loads of songs on my new iPod . __eou__ that'd be great . I'll see you then ! __eou__
So , Jack , do you believe in ghosts ? __eou__ No , not really . Why do you ask ? __eou__ Because I want to tell you about the time that I saw a ghost . __eou__ You saw a ghost ? When ? __eou__ It was many years ago , when I was a little child . It was the middle of the night , and I went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs , when ... __eou__ So that's where you saw the ghost ? In your house ? What did it look like ? Was it hideous ? __eou__ It was a big , green thing that looked like a person . It was in the kitchen , and it slowly moved towards the stairs ... __eou__ So what did you do ? __eou__ I hid so that it couldn't see me . Slowly it got closer and closer , until ... __eou__ Until what ? What happened ? Did you see it clearly ? Did it attack you ? __eou__ It moved slowly up the stairs , step by step , and I could hear its approaching footsteps . When it finally got to the top of the stairs , I realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . He had gone to get a late night snack . __eou__

What kind of food are you in the mood for ? __eou__ I'd love something spicy . Maybe we could get some Sichuan hotpot . __eou__ You are a woman after my own heart . I don't know many people who can handle spicy food . Are you sure you are up for hot pot ? __eou__ Sure . If I could , I would eat hot pot every day ! __eou__ Ok , you are really all eyes when it comes to talking about food , aren't you ? __eou__ Well , let's stop dragging our feet and find a Sichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner ! __eou__ Let me think about it for a minute . Let's see ... oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue ! Give me a second and it'll come to me . __eou__ Well ... ? Have you thought of it yet ? __eou__ No ... __eou__ Never mind . There's an authentic tasting hot pot restaurant not far from the China World Trade Towers on Chang An Street . Have you been there ? __eou__ That's it ! That ’ s the one I was thinking of ! I told you I'd remember it ! __eou__ You really have a big head , don't you . __eou__
Excuse me . Where is Q-Duck ? I remember it was around the second intersection of this street . __eou__ Q-Duck ? Do you mean the famous roast-duck store ? __eou__ Yes , definitely . __eou__ They have moved to some other places long time ago . __eou__ Wow , this place is quite different from ten years ago when I first came to China . __eou__ Yeah , a lot of changes have happened here . __eou__ This street used to have few stores . But now , you can see supermarkets , shopping malls and department stores everywhere . __eou__ Yeah , they are my wife's heaven , but not mine . I always get lost in the supermarket . __eou__ Me too ! I was lost three times ten years ago . There were no English directions then . __eou__ Is that better now ? __eou__ Yeah , there are many English signs , and wrong spellings as many as them . __eou__
You ’ re new here , right ? __eou__ Yes , I am new . __eou__ Is this your first semester ? __eou__ I just transferred from another school . __eou__ What school did you transfer from ? __eou__ I came here from PCC . __eou__ Do you like it here so far ? __eou__ I am really enjoying it here so far . __eou__ Which is better , here or PCC ? __eou__ I think PCC is a lot better than here . __eou__ Why didn ’ t you just stay at PCC ? __eou__ I graduated and now want to get a BA . __eou__
My hair stood on end when I saw the bloody scene . __eou__ What scene ? __eou__ A kitten being run over by a truck . __eou__
Adam , I'm sorry ! __eou__ But where have you been , Alice ? You're over an hour late . __eou__ Yes , but I couldn't help it . I was late getting off work for a start , and then I missed the bus . The bus I did catch got caught in a traffic jam . It was one thing after another . __eou__ But why were you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn't it ? __eou__ Yes , but there's a rush on at the moment , and my boss asked me to do some urgent letters . __eou__ But didn't you tell him you had an appointment ? __eou__ Well , no . I thought I'd finish in about five minutes , and I didn't want to be difficult about just a few minutes . If it hadn't been for missing the bus and the traffic , I wouldn't have been so late . I'm sorry . __eou__ Well , you're here . And that's the main thing . __eou__
Remember that writing contest I entered ? Well , I won first prize . __eou__ Great ! This calls for a celebration . __eou__

David , what do you want to do after graduation ? __eou__ I suppose I should choose one from the ' Best Career List ' , to be a public officer , what do you think ? __eou__ That sounds like a hot job , right ? But in my opinion , you ought not to choose one career from that so-called list , and you need to take your interests , values , and skills into account . __eou__ It beats me ! I never thought about it before and maybe I thought finding a career is a simple thing . __eou__ You'd better ask for suggestions from a career counselor , and then make a decision . __eou__
The mosquitos are biting me ! __eou__ Me , too , I can ’ t stop scratching . They are everywhere ! Sneaky little jerks . __eou__ Do you have any bug spray ? __eou__ No , I forgot to buy some . __eou__ Then we ’ ll have to put up with it . __eou__ We can cover ourselves with beer ! That way if they bite us , they ’ ll get drunk and fall asleep . __eou__ That ’ s without a doubt , the best idea you ’ Ve had ! Let ’ s do it ! __eou__ Run ! They are thirsty for more ! __eou__

What you need to do is to relax . __eou__ You're probably right . I just wish it were that simple . How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time ? __eou__ Taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress . __eou__ I don't really have time to learn anything new . I need to spend my time studying ! __eou__ You need to take some breaks throughout the day . Studying all day isn ’ t very usually effective . __eou__ You ’ re right . I usually end up staring at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class . __eou__ Besides , it ’ s not difficult to learn yoga . In fact , I can teach you a move that ’ s supposed to help you fall asleep ! You just have to sit down like this , bend over and breath in deeply . __eou__ That ’ s fantastic . I ’ m going to go try that out in my room now . good night ! __eou__ Good night , sleep tight ; don ’ t let the bed bugs bite ! __eou__

I think things are worked out just fine . __eou__
Did you get your grades yet ? __eou__ Yeah . My whole GPA is screwed up now . __eou__ Why ? What happened ? __eou__ Well , I bombed my econ final and ended up with a 1.7 . __eou__ Ouch . You must be very disappointed . __eou__ Well , it's my fault because I didn't study as much as I should have . __eou__ Why don't you re-take the class next year ? __eou__ That's what I plan on doing unless I keep screwing up . How did you do this semester ? __eou__ I didn't do that well either . I ended up with a 3.2 this semester . That drops my total GPA to 3.45 . __eou__ My GPA is pretty similar to yours . I have a 3.1 now because of the stupid econ class . __eou__ What was your GPA before this semester ? __eou__ I was sitting happy with a 3.4 . __eou__ Why did it go down so much ? __eou__ Let's just say I screwed up more than my econ class . __eou__ What happened to you ? __eou__ I started playing starcraft and ended up wasting a lot of time . __eou__ You better stop slacking off . __eou__ You're right . I'm not going to play games during school anymore . __eou__

Do you think that climate change is responsible for the recent floods ? __eou__ It could be . There are floods in this country almost every year , but in recent years they have been more widespread and more frequent . __eou__ It seems that the climate in this country is changing . __eou__ The summers are hotter . The last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years . There have also been stronger winds . __eou__ I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment . __eou__ I think you ’ re right . Climate change naturally over time , but I think that human activities are speeding up the change . I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem . __eou__ Me too . If we don ’ t do something soon , It might be too late . __eou__
Are you almost finished with my hair ? __eou__ I'm almost finished . __eou__ How much longer is it going to be ? __eou__ I'm done now .

Do what you can do now instead of twiddling your thumbs . __eou__

What do you think of smoking ? __eou__ It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others . __eou__ What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? __eou__ Stop producing cigarettes . __eou__ But that ’ ll affect the national economy . __eou__ That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways . __eou__ How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet ? __eou__ Maybe it can take effect . __eou__

How is your new job ? __eou__ It's great . I really get to focus on what I like to do and everyone has been very nice and welcoming . However , I'm having a small problem with my new colleagues . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ Well , three people are celebrating their birthdays this month and the policy here is for everyone to contribute ten dollars to a card and cake for each person . __eou__ Wow , so you'll be out thirty dollars on your first week at work ! __eou__ I know . It is a lot of money and I haven't gotten to know any of the people celebrating their birthdays well enough yet . At our old department , it was only three dollars for each birthday and there were only ten of us . __eou__ Well , every department is different . You wouldn't want your new co-workers to think you're a Grinch , right ? __eou__ What is that ? __eou__ A Grinch is a person who spoils the mood at a happy occasion by being selfish or unenthusiastic . You know - a party proper . __eou__ I definitely don't want to be that ! But , I still think it's unreasonable for them to ask me for such a big sum of money when we don't know each other very well . What should I do ? __eou__
Then I must go-you have said it yourself . __eou__ No , you must stay ! I swear it , and the oath shall be kept . __eou__ I tell you I must go ! __eou__ Where ? __eou__ I have spoken my mind , and can go anywhere now . __eou__ I ask you to pass through life at my side-to be my second self and best earthly companion . __eou__ I'll never again come to your side ; I am turn away now and can't return . __eou__
Merry Christmas ! Mary ! __eou__ Merry Christmas ! Mr Bean . __eou__ Will you come to join us at dinner this evening ? My family will be happy to see you . And father misses you very much . __eou__ Well , I would be glad to , but I have promised Tom to see his Christmas tree , and play the piano for his song tonight . __eou__
Hello , Kate ! How are you doing ? __eou__ Fine , thanks . How are you ? __eou__ Fine . How are your term papers ? __eou__ Oh my lord . I haven't really started them . __eou__ How could it be ? They are due two weeks later . __eou__ I know but I was busy with my part-time job the last few days . __eou__ Kate , you know , I am thinking of getting a part-time job next year because I really need more money and I don't want to ask my parents for any more . But I'm so busy ! How am I going to work and study ? How do you do it ? Do you have some good tips on budgeting time ? __eou__ To be honest with you , Jason , I don't think I'm doing a very good job of balancing my schoolwork with my job . I'm always two steps behind . I've got to get back to the dorm and continue writing that paper . Say ! Why don ’ t you talk to your advisor ? And let me know ! __eou__ My advisor ? __eou__
Jack , I hear you got promoted.Is that true ? __eou__ Yes . I think I'm lucky . __eou__ Oh , Jack , you deserve it.You ' Ve been working so hard . __eou__ Thank you for saying that . __eou__
Why did she do that ? __eou__ I have no idea . It was completely out of the blue . __eou__
Hurry up ! Time is money ! __eou__ Don't build a fire under me . I know the importance of time . __eou__ But you are too slow to follow them . __eou__ Don't you see I'm trying my best ? __eou__
Why is little Billy crying ? __eou__ He got a scolding . __eou__
I'm going to work in a multi-national enterprise after graduation . __eou__ but you said your dream was to be an entrepreneur , to be your own boss . __eou__ I'll do it someday . But it's not the right time now . I have to learn a lot by working as an employee . __eou__ it sounds like you've got a perfect plan . __eou__ you could say so . I'll work hard in that company and try to understand as much as possible about how to run an enterprise . __eou__ it can save you lots of time and effort to simply copy a successful business model . __eou__ yeah , the success stories of that company might be useful for me . And their customers may become the potential ones for my own company . __eou__ that's right . You should establish good relationships with them . what else are you planning to do while working for that company ? __eou__ well , I'll come up with a detailed business plan to attract the investors . __eou__ sounds perfect . I think with all that you have in mind , you'll become a successful businessman . By then , perhaps , I'll join in as a partner of your company . __eou__
Rob lost his bike . __eou__ What an idiot ! __eou__
I heard Betty lost her tennis match this morning , so she's out of the tournament . __eou__ Really ? What a shame ! I thought she was going to win this one . __eou__ Me , too . I'm sure she'll do better in the next tournament . __eou__
Can you believe the headlines ? __eou__ What are you reading ? __eou__ I ’ m reading about Michael Milliken , the Bond King . __eou__ Didn ’ t he sell worthless stocks to people or something ? He got arrested for that , didn ’ t he ? __eou__ He got arrested all right . __eou__ If I remember , he got off with a light sentence . Something like three years in a minimum-security prison . __eou__ Yup , that ’ s him . He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless . __eou__ I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He ’ s still a millionaire . __eou__ That ’ s the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail . __eou__ I know . And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years . __eou__
do you believe in UFO's ? __eou__ sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs . __eou__ I've never thought about it like that before . __eou__ I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up . __eou__ do you think that there's life on other planets ? __eou__ I think there must be . __eou__ why is that ? __eou__ I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world . The world is just far too big for that . __eou__ do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ? __eou__ no , but we're trying to contact them . __eou__ I suppose you're right . __eou__ I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet , humankind will not become extinct . __eou__ do you really think that global warming Wil destroy Earth some day ? __eou__ there's a lot of evidence that suggest it will , but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon . __eou__
It's said you will go abroad to pursue your graduate studies . __eou__ Yes , I've been thinking about visiting you . I hope to get some advice from you . __eou__ Which country do you want to go to ? __eou__ My field is electronic engineering . Which country do you think I should go ? __eou__ Were I in your position , I'd go to America . __eou__ Which university should I apply to ? __eou__ There are many universities for you to choose from . Some famous universities such as Harvard , Yale , the University of Michigan , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are really wonderful places to study , but they are very competitive and expensive . Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper . __eou__ Oh , I see . Thank you very much . __eou__
It rumored that Jean is fooling around with another woman's husband . __eou__ You gossip ! What's the basis of your opinion ? __eou__ Someone declared that he saw it . __eou__ I don't believe it . Jean is such a kind lady . How could she do this ? __eou__ Who knows ? You can't judge a book by its cover . __eou__ Maybe ! __eou__
Do you have cold medicine ? __eou__ Yes , but do you have a prescription with you ? __eou__ No , I don't . __eou__ I'm afraid you can't buy any medicine without a prescription from a doctor . __eou__ I have a headache . Is there anything I can buy without a prescription ? __eou__ Then you can buy Aspirin . __eou__ I will take the Aspirin then . And have you a small first-aid kit ? __eou__ Yes , here this is . __eou__ I'll take it too . __eou__ Thank you and take care . __eou__
It's rather cold , isn't it ? __eou__ Oh , yes , it is . __eou__ Shall I light the stove ? __eou__ That's a good idea . __eou__ Well , what's the climate like in your country ? __eou__ It's mild , but it's not always pleasant . __eou__ Which season do you like best ? __eou__ I like spring . The days are long and the night are short . The flowers are in bloom.We go on picnics . __eou__
Where do you work , Andrea ? __eou__ I work for Thomas Cook Travel . __eou__ Oh , really ? What do you do there ? __eou__ I'm a guide . I take people on tours to countries in South America , like Peru . __eou__ That sounds interesting ! __eou__ Yes , it's a great job . I love it . And what do you do ? __eou__ I'm a student , and I have a part-time job , too . __eou__ Oh ? Where do you work ? __eou__ In a fast-food restaurant . __eou__ Which restaurant ? __eou__ Hamburger Heaven . __eou__
Yeah . Just pull on this strip . Then peel off the back . __eou__ You might make a few enemies this way . __eou__ If they don't think this is fun , they're not meant to be our friends . __eou__ You mean your friends . I think it's cruel . __eou__ Yeah . But it's fun . Look at those two ugly old ladies ... or are they men ? __eou__ Hurry ! Get a shot ! ... Hand it over ! __eou__ I knew you'd come around ... __eou__
When ’ re you getting married ? __eou__ We planned our wedding for next May . __eou__ Why so late ? Didn ’ t she want to get married this October ? __eou__ Yeah , I did .

I ’ m very excited about your ceremony . __eou__
Hey ! Fred , you are five minutes earlier than me today . Usually , you don't . __eou__ Hurry ! It is time for me to steal something . __eou__ What's your meaning ? __eou__ I am stealing vegetables at the Happy Farm . __eou__ You are a thief ? __eou__ No , no . I mean stealing vegetables on Internet is very popular now . Many white collars join in this game and have a lot of fun by stealing others ' vegetables . __eou__ You mean it is a still virtual game . Your friends steal your vegetables time and time again , and you take theirs as well , right ? __eou__ You got what I meant . Perhaps , what I steal are not vegetables , but loneliness . __eou__ Don't be addicted to the game . It's not good for your job . __eou__
Bill , your work is too messy . __eou__ I'll pay attention to my handwriting next time . __eou__ Is this a promise ? __eou__ Yes , I'm serious this time . __eou__
Our maths teacher is rather humorous . __eou__ On the contrary , I think he's very serious . __eou__ No , not at all.His examples are really interesting . __eou__ So they're easy to remember . __eou__ Yeah , how about your maths teacher ? __eou__ He's an old antique , very serious . __eou__ Bad luck , Anne . __eou__ Hey ! How about your history teacher ? __eou__ She's another antique . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . __eou__

Did you check the internet for next week's weather forecast ? __eou__ I sure did . You're in luck ! It's supposed to snow all week in the mountains ! __eou__ Yes ! Somebody up there loves me ! I knew it wasn't too late for snow . __eou__ It is kind of strange though , to have snow in April , and so much of it . __eou__ There have been so many dry winters lately that it's about time , don't you think ? __eou__ When you put it that way , I guess the skies can't hold out on us forever . __eou__ This will be the best ski trip I've ever taken .

Are you absolutely certain it was her ? __eou__ Yes . yes , I am sure . __eou__ Because I don't want any , er , do you understand ? But you are quite sure , are you ? __eou__ Quite sure . I mean that hair of hers and the voice of hers . __eou__
When I quarrel with my husband . He didn't even try to cool me out . __eou__ It takes two to make a quarrel and it takes two to mend fences . __eou__ I was so angry that I could not keep cool . What I need is just an apology . __eou__
Is that you , Dave ? Oh , my gosh ! The backstabber who left us to work for the evil WebTracker ! __eou__ Yeah , yeah , yeah . Hi , Mary . How are you ? __eou__ I'm filthy rich ! Haven't you heard about the MicroPower deal ? __eou__ Yeah , I guess I did . They're going to buy invoking ? __eou__ That's right . For seventy-five million . So how are you ? __eou__ I'm getting by OK . I heard MicroPower was going to make Zina president of their new invoking Internet division . __eou__
The summer vacation is coming . Have you any plans ? __eou__ I haven't made up my mind . Maybe I will go to the US . What about you ? __eou__ I am going on a hiking trip . It's good exercise as well as fun . __eou__ I think so . __eou__ So why not come and join us ? Lee will come as well . __eou__ That's great . I will go hiking with you . __eou__
It seems that something is praying heavy on you.What ’ s the matter ? __eou__ I got my father ’ s goat last night . __eou__ What did you do to get his goat ? __eou__ When I asked him to treat me like he does to my sisters , he jumped down my throat . So I took it out on him by telling him what I thought . __eou__
We need to elect club officials before the summer starts . __eou__ I guess we should start with nominees first . __eou__ Let's make it the first item of business in our next meeting . __eou__ We should probably let everyone know ahead of time so they will be prepared . __eou__ Can you take care of sending out a bulletin by e-mail to all the club members ? __eou__ Yes , I can do that this afternoon . __eou__ Let's schedule the actual election times the week after the nominations . Doesn't that seem logical ? __eou__ Yes , let me put it on the calendar . __eou__
How's business ? __eou__ Couldn't be better . __eou__
are you looking for a course ? __eou__ yes , but I'm not sure which one to sign up for . __eou__ what kind of program are you looking for ? Full-time or part-time ? __eou__ I have to work during the day , so I want to find a part-time course that I can do in the evenings . __eou__ what kind of course are you looking for ? __eou__ I need to improve my English . __eou__ do you want a one-to-one private tutor or a group class ? __eou__ I think a one-to-one course will be too expensive for me , so a group class would be fine . __eou__ have you ever considered taking one of our online courses ? __eou__ I think I prefer face-to-face instruction better . __eou__ that's fine . If you want , you can sign up for a pre-sessional interview . __eou__ what's that for ? __eou__ one of our qualified teachers will interview you so that they can find a class that suits you best . __eou__ do you have a brochure about the course that I can take home to read ? __eou__ sure .

Hi , Mr . Zhang . What ’ s wrong ? You don ’ t look so happy . How was your date ? __eou__ I was turned down again . It ’ s frustrating . I guess you ’ Ve got to teach me some skills . __eou__ Me ? I ’ m even less experienced than you are . __eou__ At least you know what American women generally like in a man . __eou__ Believe it or not , I guess American women like a man in good shape , which Chinese women may not care about so much . That ’ s my honest opinion . I know you have been trying very hard . __eou__ American men are naturally taller than Chinese men . So even if I exercise , there aren ’ t many chances . __eou__ No , that ’ s not true . I ’ Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese . But those Chinese look very strong and healthy . So if you exercise more often , I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls . How old is Jacky Chan ? He ’ s small and short . But I bet he can have any American woman he wants . __eou__ You know , that ’ s going to be a tremendous change for me . Because I never exercise . __eou__ Why don ’ t you try then ? Even if it doesn ’ t help you find an American girl , you could still have a stronger and healthier body . You won ’ t lose anything by doing that . __eou__
Who is it ? __eou__ Open the door . It's me . I can't find the key . __eou__ You're always so careless . __eou__ Oh , thank you . I am exhausted . Will you bring me a cup of tea ? __eou__ Okay , but I haven't prepare supper . __eou__ So let's eat out . __eou__ What do you want to eat ? __eou__ Noodles . How about you ? __eou__ Dumplings . __eou__
Recently , there prevails ' Net Love ' ! __eou__ What's Net Love ? __eou__ Two people chat on the Net and step by step fall into love ! It's Net Love . __eou__ Ridiculous ! They haven't met ! Maybe they're the same sex ! __eou__ Maybe yesterday you've received a man's woos . He's called ' Beast ' ? __eou__ How could you know ? __eou__ I watched the screen display ! __eou__ Do you know ' He ' is Ms . Rebecca ! __eou__ It's typical Net Love , and a typical lesbians ' homosex ! HA ! __eou__ Impossible ! __eou__
What shall we do tonight ? __eou__ How about the cinema ? __eou__ That's a good idea.We haven't been there for ages . __eou__ What would you suggest to see ? __eou__ Oh , I don't know.It depends . __eou__
I want to have Mexican food for dinner . __eou__ I'm tired of Mexican food . Besides , you picked the restaurant last week . __eou__ OK , you win . You pick the restaurant this time . __eou__
Tom's dating your sister . __eou__ Are you sure ? __eou__
It's almost 6:00 . I'd better be going . __eou__ Can you stay for dinner ? We'd love to have you join us . __eou__ It's really nice of you . Thanks ! __eou__
I'm calling about our appointment . I can't call on you this evening.My wife is terribly ill . __eou__ Sorry to hear that . __eou__ How about next week ? __eou__ Fine , we'll be expecting you then . __eou__
You honestly believe the world ’ s improving every year ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I think that science is making us wiser . What do you think ? __eou__ I don ’ t think you ’ re right there . __eou__ I believe industry is making us wealthier . __eou__ I don ’ t believe that . __eou__ And in my opinion , medicine is making us healthier . __eou__ I agree with you in the sense . But we ’ re all more miserable than ever , aren ’ t we ? __eou__ I don ’ t agree with you . I maintain that we ’ re healthier , wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago . __eou__ That ’ s your opinion not mine . __eou__
How was your date recently ? __eou__ Not too bad . It is seemingly too hard for me to find a place for our date . __eou__ I guess so . Going to watch a movie and having dinner at a restaurant are usual . __eou__ She said she wanted to go Dutch in dating . __eou__ Yes , now many girls want to be independent , so it is a little popular , especially among white collars . __eou__ But I am still traditional , so I felt weird when she paid for herself . __eou__ Forget about it ! __eou__ Are you satisfied with your girlfriend ? __eou__ It will be a long story . We have many differences , for example , she usually puts all her clothes into washing machine . That is the sort of thing I can not bear . __eou__
You ’ re going to set up your own law office , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . After so many years of hard work , I ’ d rather I had an office of my own . __eou__ If you need help , don ’ t hesitate to ask me . __eou__ I ’ ll be very glad if you would help . __eou__ I ’ d like to wish you every success in your new venture . __eou__ Thank you . I wish I would . __eou__ Good luck to you . __eou__

And he started out studying alembics , singing , dancing and martial arts at the age of nine , and has tarred in 140 kung fu films . He has also become an independent producer and director . __eou__ You know only one aspect of him . Do you know what he would do in the kitchen ? __eou__ I have no idea . Tell me . __eou__ In the kitchen , with his wife by his side he still puts on quite a dinner time show . __eou__ What does he do there ? __eou__ Imagine a chef chopping vegetables on fast forward . Picture a man making a stir-fry , tossing the mixture up in the air , and then catching it , every last bit , in his work . And his culinary motto is ' Enjoy the moment . ' If you want to know hey theycook , visit www.StudioClassroom.com.tw for the recipe . __eou__
Wasn't that a great flick ? I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie . __eou__ I would say it was a typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood thriller . __eou__ Well , I'm no movie expert , but those special effects were impressive by any standards . __eou__ Special effects ? Baloney ! That movie was made on a shoestring budget . They've been using trick photography like that for years __eou__ Okay . But you have to admit that it was an exciting story , especially with that surprise ending . __eou__ You should read the book . The original story is much better and has a different twist at the end . __eou__ Oh , really ? How does the book end ? __eou__ Read it yourself and find out ! __eou__
Do you know the highest mountain in the world ? __eou__ Yes . It is Everest , also called Zhumulangma in China . It is 8,844 . 43 meters above the sea level . __eou__ Wow ! That must be really awesome to stand on the top of the mountain to overlook the earth . __eou__ Actually , it is impossible because the mountain is covered with snow all year around . And is has heavy fog for most of the time . __eou__ Have people set foot on its peak ? __eou__ Yes , it has been conquered by many people in history . __eou__
I have been feeling sick for three days . __eou__ I'm most upset to hear that.Are you better now ? __eou__ Not much better.Thank you . __eou__

Alice , I never knew you had such a lovely voice . You really can sing , can't you ? __eou__ Thanks , Mark . I used to be a member of the school choir . __eou__ No wonder you can control your voice so well . You are a professional singer . __eou__ Well , you are flattering me . I wouldn't say I am a professional , but I did receive some training at school . My music teacher used to be a professional singer . __eou__ Well , a good teacher makes good students . __eou__ You are quite right . __eou__
Mr.Keller , may I call at your home sometime the week ? __eou__ Oh , certainly.When would you like to come ? __eou__ Well , when will it be convenient for you ? __eou__ This weekend would be OK with me . __eou__
I Don't know how they do it ! Our competitors have undercut us by 10 % percent on the price of our latest model . There is no way will be able to compete against that . We're barely breaking even with the present prices . __eou__ These price wars are disastrous for our bottom line . If they're charging 10 % less than we are , we've got to find a way to lower our price while keeping our profit . __eou__ Profits are almost nonexistent now , we can't beat their price . How do they keep their price so low ? __eou__ We can try to lower our cost of production then . We need a price that we can compete with , something comparable with the competition . __eou__ You really think we can make it ? I don't have much faith in our ability to lower the price again . We're no match for them , the competition will beat us hands down . __eou__
Did you know Carl is almost fifty ? __eou__ Are you sure ? He doesn't look that old . __eou__ He told me so himself . __eou__

Well , you seem to enjoy speaking English . __eou__ You can't help learning when you're using it all day.You ' ll see . A few weeks ' study in the school will have a similar effect on you . __eou__ I hope so.You see , at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent . I'm awfully worried , I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect . __eou__ Oh , she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class.She doesn't mind your making mistakes , though . __eou__ You know , speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use . __eou__
What ? You want to leave early ? __eou__ Yes . Can I ? __eou__ Do you really need to ? __eou__ Yes . Is it OK with you ? __eou__ Is it important ? __eou__ Yes . Do you mind ? __eou__ You really have to ? __eou__ Yes . Will you let me ? __eou__ I guess so . __eou__
What sort of things do you grow in your garden ? __eou__ I grow a variety of things , so that something is in bloom all year round . __eou__ When is your garden at its best ? __eou__ It looks best in spring , when the plum and cherry blossoms are out . __eou__

Did you say that Ted was at your mercy ? __eou__ Sort of yes . __eou__ But he is not someone who can be led by the nose . __eou__ But I am not that someone . I can easily talk him into doing whatever I want him to do . __eou__
I failed the exam because I didn't study . __eou__ Serves you right . __eou__
Good morning . Sanyu Restaurant . May I help you ? __eou__ What time do you open this evening ? __eou__ We open at 6:30 , sir . __eou__ I see . I'd like to reserve a table for two . __eou__ Yes , sir . What time would you like your table , sir ? __eou__ I'm not sure , perhaps around 8 pm . __eou__ Fine ! I'll reserve a table for two at 8 pm , sir . May I have your name , please ? __eou__ Davis . __eou__ Thank you , Mr . Davis . __eou__ Oh , any chance of a table by the window ? My wife loves the bird's eye view . As it's her birthday , I want it to be a celebration . __eou__ I see . We have already received many bookings and though I can't guarantee anything , please be assured that we'll try our best , Mr . Davis . I hope you'll understand . __eou__ I do , but I would appreciate you , if it could be arranged . __eou__ We'll try our best . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Wow , this is drop-dead gorgeous . __eou__ So no more regret now ? __eou__ Don't remind me of that . This would be the last time I cut any classes for a basketball game . __eou__ Come on . Don't be so hard on yourself . Enjoy your life . __eou__ I just can't help it . Oh , look at Clive , he is really a big hit . They are definitely gonna win . __eou__ It's only seven minutes into the game , too early to cheer up . __eou__ Come on , 18 points already , they are never gonna catch up . __eou__ Who knows ! It's a long game . Look ! That was a really nice shot ! __eou__ Thay are coming back to narrow the gap . __eou__ Wait , that guy , I know him . He is just a bench warmer . __eou__ A secret weapon . They'd better set up the defense now . __eou__ Clive is ready to explode . Keep your eyes open . __eou__ Oh , man ! I can't believe it . A slam dunk ! __eou__ Good that he resembled his old , quick self . __eou__
Look at that pretty girl . __eou__ Wow ! She's gorgeous . __eou__
What are the seasons like in your city ? __eou__ Summers are hot and usually lasts a long time . Winters are short , but cold , wet , and windy . I love the summers in my city , but I hate the wintertime . __eou__ Does it ever rain in summer ? __eou__ We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks , but apart from that , summers are dry . Thunderstorms make the air fresh again , so most people don ’ t mind then . __eou__ What are spring and autumn like ? __eou__ I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again . In spring , the weather is very changeable-sometimes cold , sometimes warm . It ’ s usually windy with some rain . Autumn is usually sunny and dry , but it ’ s gradually gets colder as winter arrives . What are the seasons like in you city ? __eou__ Well , I live in the southern hemisphere , so our summertime is your wintertime , and vice versa . We get some rain in every season , but most is in winter . In winter , it sometimes gets cold , but our winters are usually quite mild . Summers are warm , but not hot . Spring and autumn are both very short-sometimes just a few weeks each . The weather is very changeable then-just like spring in your city . __eou__ Do you usually go on a summer holiday ? __eou__ No , I don ’ t . I go on a winter holiday instead . I go somewhere warm . __eou__ I usually go on holiday during the spring or the autumn . I try to go somewhere where the weather is more reliable than in my city . __eou__
How do you think people get their personalities ? __eou__ I think it ’ s mainly from the environment a person lives in . __eou__ Don ’ t you think people get their personalities from their parents ? __eou__ No , but parents control a lot of the environment that kids grow up in , so they certainly influence their kids ' personalities a lot . __eou__ So why do you think many kids have personalities that are so different from their parents . __eou__ Maybe when they become teenagers , they want to be completely different to their parents . __eou__ You might be right . I guess most parents want their kids to be like them , but kids today grow up in a different environment . You know , they know much more about the world from the internet , newspapers , and tv . __eou__ Do you think that teenagers get a lot of their bad behaviour from tv and movies ? __eou__ Maybe some of it . I think a lot of people blame TV and movies when the real problem is that the parents aren ’ t bringing their child up correctly . __eou__ Parents have a difficult job . They have to bring up their children and usually have to work too . __eou__ Yes , that ’ s true . Your son is doing well at school , isn ’ t he ? __eou__ Yes , he is . He ’ s very hardworking when he ’ s at school . Then he comes home from school and does homework before dinner . After dinner , he goes out with his friends . __eou__ So , he ’ s not a bookworm ? It ’ s good that he has an outgoing personality . Some kids are very quiet and introverted . You wonder they ’ ll survive in the real world without their parents to support them . __eou__
Are you an art aficionado ? __eou__ Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art . __eou__ I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ’ t pay much attention in art class at school . __eou__ Art isn ’ t for everyone . I ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture . __eou__ I like sculpture , especially that form ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I ’ d love to go with you . __eou__ I thought I ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there . __eou__ That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ? __eou__ Let ’ s meet at 12:30 . it will probably take us there or four hours to see all of the exhibits . __eou__
your daughter will be back soon . I'm going to start making dinner . You can just watch some TV in TV room if you like . We just bought a new TV with a LCD screen . The remote control is on the coffee ta __eou__ would you mind if I helped out in the kitchen instead ? I do enjoy cooking . __eou__ this is supposed to be your vacation ; we'd like you to just relax . __eou__ cooking makes me feel relaxed . So , what are we cooking ? __eou__ ok , well , we're going to make a pan of lasagne , a salad , and some garlic bread . Here's the recipe . Do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ? __eou__ sure . We should probably pre-heat the oven right away , too . __eou__ that's a good idea . Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ? __eou__ that's a bit high for lasagne . I'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there . __eou__ fine . I'll just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet . __eou__ you know , I could do this myself . Why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ? __eou__ I don't think it's broken . __eou__ well , if it's not broken , then you need to learn how to vacuum better , because it doesn't look like you've vacuumed for ages ! __eou__ fine . I'll go vacuum . Let me know if you need any other help . __eou__
It's very kind of you to come and see us off . __eou__ My pleasure.What a pity you have to leave so soon ! __eou__ We would stay longer . but I've got to attend a meeting tomorrow morning . Thank you for your warm hospitality . __eou__ You're welcome . Maybe next time we'll come to see you . __eou__ My wife and I will look forward to it . __eou__ I promise the next holiday I have we're coming to visit . Oh , what's your flight number ? __eou__ lt's Flight No . 302 , Northwest Orient Airlines . __eou__ They just announced the boarding call . __eou__ Then we've got to get going . __eou__ OK . Bon voyage and a safe landing . __eou__ Thank you again for all your help . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
Labor is an abundant resource here . __eou__ One of many abundant resources , I'd like to point out . __eou__
I'm afraid I've had a terrible row with my boss . What shall I do ? __eou__ I think you'd better apologize . __eou__ Oh , but I can't . It wasn't my fault . __eou__ Maybe not , but I advice you to say it was your fault . __eou__
What's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired . __eou__ My father failed in business . __eou__ Oh , that's really tough . __eou__ Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced . __eou__ I can understand . By the way , is there anyway I can help ? __eou__ No , not now . I have found a part-time job.So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties . __eou__ Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Come in . It's nice to see you again . __eou__ It's nice to be here . __eou__ Would you care for a drink ? __eou__ Just a club soda for me , please . __eou__
What can I do for you ? __eou__ I want to check out these books . __eou__ I need your library card . __eou__ I have it right here . __eou__ It seems you have late fees . __eou__ Are you sure ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m sure . __eou__ How much ? __eou__ Your late fees come to $ 24.50 . __eou__ I don ’ t have that right now . __eou__ You have to pay it off before you can check out more books . __eou__ I ’ ll do that soon . __eou__
Hi Sarah , how are you ? __eou__ Fine , how are you doing ? __eou__ OK . __eou__ What do you want to do ? __eou__ I'm hungry . I'd like to eat something . __eou__ Where do you want to go ? __eou__ I'd like to go to an Italian restaurant . __eou__ What kind of Italian food do you like ? __eou__ I like spaghetti . Do you like spaghetti ? __eou__ No , I don't , but I like pizza . __eou__
How was your date with Betty ? __eou__ Let's change the subject . __eou__
The Johnson are on their way back . You remember them , don't you ? __eou__ Johnson ? I can't place them . __eou__ We met them in Bermuda last May . __eou__ They've completely slipped my mind . __eou__ The couple with the dogs-think back . __eou__ No , I don't recall a thing about them . __eou__ Well , I've invited them for brunch . __eou__ Hmm , I must be getting absent-minded . __eou__
Good to see you . Come on in . __eou__ Thank you . Here's a present for you . __eou__ Oh , you shouldn't . But thank you very much . __eou__
I have never experienced a roller coaster . I want you to sit beside me . __eou__ Wait a moment , I want to go to the toilet . __eou__ You try to put on a brave face . __eou__
It seems that you are an optimistic man who doesn't dismay easily . That is what a good salesman needs . Good luck . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ I guess we have covered all the stuff that we need to discuss and it's time to say goodbye . __eou__ Yes , goodbye and keep in touch . __eou__
What are you going to do for your year abroad , Tim ? __eou__ Study study study ! I want to learn a lot . __eou__ You ’ re going to take courses ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m going to take some university courses there . __eou__ Sounds hard . __eou__ Yes , but I think it ’ s probably for the best . __eou__ Won ’ t you get lonely ? __eou__ Hey , I ’ m a pretty cool guy ; I ’ ll make friends . And I ’ ll have a lot of extra-curricular activities too . You know , like fencing or theater or something . __eou__
You're from New York , aren't you ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . __eou__ What do you suggest I should see in New York ? __eou__ Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ? __eou__ No , I don't like museums.They ' re boring . __eou__ Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ? __eou__ Ah ! That sounds interesting . __eou__
I ’ ll sing you a song . __eou__ Yes , sing a song . But don ’ t sing a sad song . __eou__ Most of my songs are sad , sorry . __eou__ Well , please sing one that ’ s not sad . __eou__ OK , I ’ ll sing San Francisco then . __eou__
Is this Zhang Lin's home ? __eou__ Yes.Oh , it's you , Linda . I haven't seen you for a long time.Well , come in and sit down.How about something to drink ? __eou__ Yes , please . I'm a little thirsty , actually . __eou__ Would you like tea or coffee ? __eou__ Coffee , please . __eou__ Here you are . __eou__ Would you like to talk over a drink ? __eou__ That sounds good . How are you doing , Linda ? __eou__ Just fine.Are you busy now ? __eou__ No . I'm just killing time . __eou__ Shall we visit our math teacher tomorrow ? __eou__ Yes . I haven't been in his house for several weeks.When shall we start ? __eou__ How about eight o'clock tomorrow morning ? __eou__ All right . See you tomorrow . __eou__
I am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year , what do you say ? __eou__ Fantastic ! I enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette . __eou__ How did that happen ? __eou__ A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face . __eou__ Sounds cool ! But that is not what a lady should do . People are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk . __eou__
How's your mother doing ? __eou__ She is so pretty sick . __eou__ That's too bad . I wish your mother can recover soon . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
The trouble is not that . It is that he may suddenly remember something I promised him a couple of weeks ago , out of a clear blue sky . Then he complains that I have gone back on my words . __eou__ Does he do that with his Dad ? I mean , does he complain things to his father ? __eou__ He never does , and in fact , he seldom communicates with him . __eou__ But didn ’ t you say that his Dad takes him under his wings ? __eou__ Yes , I did . He only takes side with him . He seldom asks what Dick is doing . __eou__
Do you know where you want to transfer to ? __eou__ I don ’ t have the slightest clue . __eou__ What school would you like to go to ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure . __eou__ You honestly have no idea ? __eou__ PCC is perfectly fine for me . __eou__ You might as well stay here . __eou__ That ’ s not a bad idea . __eou__ PCC is a wonderful institution . __eou__ You have a point . __eou__ So , what are you going to do ? __eou__ I ’ m just going to keep going to PCC . __eou__
Hi , Walter ! __eou__ Hi , Sterling ! __eou__ What do you think of our new teacher ? __eou__ Professor Wood ? I think he's a brilliant scientist . __eou__ You're got a point there.But do you think he's a little absent-minded ? __eou__ I guess so . __eou__
Hello , Bob , this is Frank . __eou__ I know , we've met . __eou__ I didn't know you knew Frank . __eou__ Yes , we met last year at a conference . __eou__
Aren't you staying for the party ? __eou__ No . I'm tired and I've got to work tomorrow . __eou__ I don't blame you for getting some rest . __eou__ Yeah . I need to . __eou__
What ? __eou__ What happened with that guy at the cafe ? __eou__ nothing __eou__ But you ’ re crazy about him ? __eou__ Yes , I am . __eou__ Why don ’ t you run off with him ? What are you waiting for ? __eou__ I don ’ t actually know him . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ I only know him through the ... you are not gonna believe this . __eou__ Oh , let me guess . Through the internet ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Hmm . You ’ Ve got mail . __eou__
How do you like Tom ? __eou__ I like him very much . He ’ s a gay dog . __eou__ Are you ready to welcome him ? __eou__ I am all set . He can come anytime . __eou__
What kind of job have you ever had ? __eou__ I used to work as a teacher . __eou__ How did you like your job ? __eou__ Oh , if I hadn't moved here I would never thought of changing it . __eou__
It ’ s a wonderful party , Joan , The food , the drink , the atmosphere ... Everyone is enjoying himself . __eou__ Thanks to your help.To our friendship . __eou__ Bottoms up !

Every girl on the campus has a crush on those handsome guys . __eou__ I'll surely make introductions for them . __eou__
This is the first time for me to have a Chinese guest . I hope you like western cooking . __eou__ Yes . I like it very much . __eou__ Cooking is a hobby with me . I'm always trying to think up new recipes . I hope you like the soup . It's kind of a specialty of mine , so I hope you enjoy it . __eou__ It's excellent . __eou__ Thank you for your compliment . Won't you try this fish with white sauce ? I'm rather round of it . __eou__ It's delicious . __eou__ What sort of western food do you like best ? __eou__ I like beefsteak very much . Have you tried Chinese dishes ? __eou__ I find the Chinese dishes wonderful . __eou__ Well , it's getting late . I have to get up early tomorrow . So I must say good night . __eou__ It's still early . __eou__
To be a revolutionary needs great courage ! __eou__ He must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities . __eou__ Galileo is one of them . __eou__ So are Copernicus and many others . __eou__
I think Andy's party will be fun . __eou__ Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ? __eou__ Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ? __eou__ My boots ? Er ... Sure , ok . __eou__
Hot in here , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah , really . __eou__ Is it Ok if I sit here ? __eou__ Of course . Suit yourself . __eou__ Thanks . My name's Bill Peters , by the way . __eou__ Hi , I'm Susan Jackson . __eou__ Nice to meet you . And what do you do , Susan ? __eou__ I'm a student at UCLA . __eou__ Oh , are you ? And what are you studying ? __eou__ Medicine . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , I want to be a doctor one of these days . What about you ? __eou__ I'm an engineer , I work for Boeing . Say , would you like a drink ? __eou__ Sure . Thanks . __eou__
So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ? __eou__ Well , I've already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown . __eou__ That's cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ? __eou__ I ’ m planning on living with my parents . Won't you ? __eou__ I couldn't even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then I'd have to find my own place . __eou__ You mean they're kicking you out ? __eou__ Not really , they just don't want me living at home . My older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out . __eou__ Well , it's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it's ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so . __eou__ My parents just didn't handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . They think that it's important that I should learn how to live on my own . __eou__ I know I need to learn that myself , but I just don't have the money for it at the moment . Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place . __eou__
I'd love to continue this conversation , but I really need to go now . I have to get back to the office . __eou__ Well , let's get together soon . __eou__ Okay . Would you like to have lunch some day next week ? __eou__ Sure . How about Monday ? __eou__ Hmm . I'm afraid I can't make it on Monday . I've got to fly to Chicago on business . __eou__ Well unfortunately , I'm tied up on Tuesday . I'm supposed to have lunch with an important visitor from out of town , and I don't think there's any way I can get out of it.Are you free on Wednesday ? __eou__ Wednesday ? Let me see . Hmm . Somehow I think I've already got something scheduled for Wednesday . Oh , yes ! I've got an appointment with my dentist to have my teeth cleaned , and it's essential that I keep it . __eou__ Well , I'm afraid Thursday is out for me . I'm expected to attend a meeting of our personnel committee , and it's very important for me to be there . __eou__ So that leaves Friday . I don't have any obligations or commitments on Friday.How about you ? __eou__ Friday sounds good . Where should we meet ? __eou__ You know , I really must be going now or I'll be very late . Can you give me a call tomorrow an we'll decide ? __eou__
Where are you going ? __eou__ It ’ s Tuesday today . I always go to my class on Tuesday night . __eou__ I didn ’ t know you were taking any kind of class . Tell me about it . __eou__ Well , I ’ m learning how to use math in the business environment . __eou__ What for ? __eou__ The job market is so competitive nowadays . I want to develop some useful skills . __eou__ I really admire you for that . How is it going ? __eou__ It ’ s going all right . I ’ m learning some things for the first time , but I ’ m also brushing up on some things that I already know . __eou__
May I ask what the name is the girl ? __eou__ Which one ? __eou__ The tallest one . __eou__ She is Miao Li . She's come here to see her brother . __eou__ Oh , it's so . She looks very lovely .

She is a nice girl . __eou__ I'm wondering if she has boyfriend . __eou__ No , she hasn't . __eou__ Great ! Thank you very much . __eou__
How may I help you ? __eou__ I want to get a passport . __eou__ You need to apply for a passport . __eou__ When can I apply for it ? __eou__ You can apply right now . __eou__ I ’ d like to do that . __eou__ Fill this out , please . __eou__ What ’ s next ? __eou__ I will need to take your passport picture . __eou__ When will my passport be ready ? __eou__ It will take about three weeks . __eou__ That ’ s great . Thank you . __eou__
What are you thinking about ? __eou__ About my boyfriend . __eou__ Again ! __eou__ You are really a wet blanket . __eou__
Mr . : For tomorrow , read pages 12 to 20 . Then do exercises one through ten on page 21 . __eou__ Do we have to type out our homework ? __eou__ Mr . : No .

By the way , review today's notes this evening . We may have a small quiz tomorrow . __eou__
Lucy , come here ! I can see the lake which is in the center of park . __eou__ It is beautiful ! Look , there are so many birds around it . __eou__ It is a great place for a relaxing vacation . __eou__ Listen to the sound of nature ! It's like music . __eou__ Yeah , I agree . It makes you feel really good . __eou__ What are those ? __eou__ Do you mean the red things ? They are roses . __eou__ I'm going to take more pictures today . __eou__ Me , too . __eou__
So , is L . A . all it's cracked up to be ? __eou__ Well , the stereotype in the movies is that L . A . is a frivolous town with a lot of flaky people . I guess , in the back of my mind , that's what I expected . __eou__ And , is it what you found ? __eou__ Well , it is and it's not . The city of L . A . is much bigger and more diverse than I had expected . There are people here from all over the country and all over world , like New York . I've heard people say that in L . A . , everyone is from somewhere else . Tha's partly true . So , I've met all kinds of people here . What I'm realizing is that the picture of L . A . that's in movies only represents a small segment of the city . __eou__ You're right . Life isn't always like the movies . __eou__
Good morning , Miss . __eou__ Morning . Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I'd like to know how to use the library . You know , I'm a new student here . __eou__ All you need is your student identification card to check out books . __eou__ Yes . Here's my identification . __eou__ That's all you need . __eou__ Thank you very much . By the way , how many books am I allowed to check out ? __eou__ You can check out two books at a time . But you can't check out newspapers , magazines and periodicals , they have to be read within library . __eou__ How long can I keep the books ? __eou__ For two weeks . After that you must renew the book if you wish to keep them longer . __eou__ I want a book on physics . Could you show me where I can find it ? __eou__ Yes , over there to your left . __eou__
What a wonderful game ! __eou__ Yes , the weather is wonderful , the game is wonderful and the players are wonderful . __eou__ I think John is the best player on the field . __eou__ He certainly is . He is the Peckham in our collage . __eou__ Maybe he shouldn ’ t come to collage , he should become a football star . __eou__
Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me ! I ’ Ve always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me !

By the way , how many books am I allowed to check out ? __eou__ You can check out two books at a time . __eou__ How long can I keep the books ? __eou__ For two weeks . After that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer . __eou__
Susan ? What brings you here today ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve got some papers due . __eou__ Really ? So what ’ s the news ? __eou__ Not too good yet . Better than I was though . __eou__
I'm going on a guided tour in the mountain . __eou__ You'll see the world-famous magnificent waterfall . __eou__ I like the sight and the sound . It worked on me like a magic when I was a child __eou__ Your dream will come true . It's really breathtaking __eou__
I work so hard that I do not have the energy to exercise . __eou__ That is just an excuse.You can always find some time to exercise . __eou__ But I work hard all the time for long hours . Often I have no time for lunch . Yet , I am still getting fatter . __eou__ Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing.And skipping meals will not help you lose weight.In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals . __eou__ I know you're right , but what can I do ? __eou__ How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ? __eou__ But I'll miss the news.It ' s important in my business to keep up with events in China . __eou__ I know , I know.Have you got a portable radio ? You can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time . __eou__ That's a good idea ! __eou__
Excuse me , how can I fill in this blank ? What does marital status mean ? __eou__ Are you married ? __eou__ No , I'm still single . __eou__ Then , you put S in this blank . __eou__
Good morning , you look very tired . __eou__ Yes , I nearly didn't sleep last night . __eou__ Did you hold a party or something else yesterday ? __eou__ No , I just watched Supergirl , and it began too late in the night . I was too excited to get asleep after one o'clock . __eou__ I don't like this program , because there are too many constant arguments between the judges . __eou__ The contestants are different . These girls perform in free styles . __eou__ Do you have much time watching TV ? __eou__ I think less than 3 hours . This year I didn't watch any entertainment programs . Too many ads between the programs . I prefer listening to the radio . __eou__ I don't like ads , either . But ads could bring big profits to the TV station . __eou__ If they could make beautiful ads , I could bear . __eou__

My book says it's 102 stories tall . __eou__ it's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ? __eou__ you're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering . __eou__ what other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ? __eou__ quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center .

New York is one of the financial centers of the words so there are lots of very expensive places . __eou__

Hello Mike ! Would you like a drink ? __eou__ No , thank you . I had too much to drink yesterday evening . I had a bad hangover this morning . My head felt terrible . __eou__ Were you celebrating something ? __eou__ Yes . It was a friend ’ s birthday party . We drank all kinds of things-beer , wine and spirits . After midnight , we were even drinking cocktails ! __eou__ It ’ s a bad idea to drink a combination of alcoholic drinks . You should stick with one for the whole evening . __eou__ I know , but it was a celebration , you Kwon ? I don ’ t think I ’ Ve see you drunk . __eou__ I usually only drink beer and I rarely drink more than a few pints . __eou__ You are a sensible drinker .

He's only interested in harassing you . How can he expect us to have so much time to waste ? __eou__ I almost want to send him a virus to shut his stupid computer down . __eou__ As obnoxious as Bean is , we should still try to finish this case . __eou__ True-well , do you have any forwards for me to send him ? __eou__ Yeah !

It ’ s not you , it ’ s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guythat any woman would kill for ! __eou__ So , what are you saying ? You ’ re breaking up with me because I ’ m perfect ? __eou__ Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ’ d only hurt you , I know I ’ d only make you cry . __eou__ Baby , come on . Don ’ t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ’ t leave me . __eou__ I can ’ t , Tim .

Did you hear what happened to Mike in Accounts ? __eou__ No . What ? __eou__ He got arrested on Friday night and spent the night in jail . __eou__ No . Really , what happened ? __eou__ Well , it was all a big mistake , actually . He got home on Friday night really late , and apparently he'd been out drinking with some clients , so he was really drunk . __eou__ Was he out with the guys from the bank ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . __eou__ Oh , yeah , they always get really drunk . __eou__ Well , anyway , he'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys , so he couldn't get in . He lives alone , you know . __eou__ Oh , really . I thought he lived with his wife . __eou__ No , she left him last year . __eou__ Oh , really ? Do you know why ? __eou__ Hang on , let me finish telling you what happened . Where was I ? __eou__ He lost his wallet and keys . __eou__ Oh yes , well , he tried to climb in through the bathroom window , but apparently he slipped and broke the glass with his foot . The neighbors heard him and thought a robbery was in progress , so they called the police . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ Yes . So when the cops arrived , they didn't believe his story __eou__ So then what happened ? __eou__ Well , when he sobered up , he called someone from work to come and bail him out . __eou__ Well , that's a bit of a tricky situation . __eou__ Yes , I know . __eou__
What's your opinion about childless couples ? Will you choose to have no kids ? __eou__ To be honest , I wouldn't . __eou__ Why ? Do you have to make a choice now ? __eou__ Not really . But it has puzzled me for a long time . __eou__ What's the puzzle ? __eou__ My husband and I prefer to have no kids , but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids . __eou__ Oh , I see . I think the older generation tend to think in a different way . __eou__ Yes . It seems she can never accept a childless marriage . We had a fight last night . __eou__ Oh , really ? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren . __eou__ But it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not . __eou__ Definitely . __eou__ You know , I often overhear our neighbor , the young couple , fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness . __eou__ Don't worry . I think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together . __eou__ I guess you're right . But I still prefer to have no child . __eou__ Sure . You can fully enjoy your time together . __eou__
Hi , Jim and Wendy . Where're you going ? __eou__ We're going to that new restaurant for lunch . Would you like to join us ? __eou__

He ’ s my idol . __eou__ How come you don ’ t have all of his films on DVD ? __eou__ Some of his early films are hard to find nowadays , especially the ones where he only played a bit part . __eou__ I see . I ’ m sure you ’ ll find them one day . I see you also have several poster of him . __eou__ Yes . These posters are new . I bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday . __eou__ Are you a member of his fan club ? __eou__ I was , but then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet , so I ’ m not a member now . __eou__ Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ? __eou__ Of course ! I bought two copies . __eou__ Two copies ? One to keep and one to cut the pictures out of , right ? __eou__
How did you enjoy your family party at “ ginger ’ s ” ? I hear that they have a lovely menu and buffet . __eou__ Oh , it was great . We had seafood buffet . They do one every Friday . The waiters and waitresses are very good . They are very attentive , but don ’ t hang around the table . __eou__ I like the buffets they have , but if often order a la carte , because I don ’ t feel extremely hungry . I like the wine list there too . __eou__ Yes , so do I . they have wines from all over the world . There is a good range of prices to suit every pocket . We ordered some Australian red wine , which tasted delicious and wasn ’ t expensive . __eou__ Some restaurants allow you to take your own wine and just charge you corkage , but the don ’ t do that at “ ginger ’ s ” . what was included in the seafood buffet ? __eou__ They had almost every kind of seafood . There were oyster , shrimp , prawns , crabs , and fish . I ate a lot of smoked salmon . __eou__ Did they have lobster ? __eou__ No , they didn ’ t . you could order it from the menu . I think that lobster is too expensive to be included in the buffet . __eou__ Yes , it probably is . I don ’ t like ordering oysters in restaurants . You never know whether they are fresh . __eou__ I know . I didn ’ t eat any , but a few people in our group did and no one got sick . __eou__ When you eat out , do you usually eat from the buffet ? __eou__ Not usually . I usually just order a main course and have a dessert if I ’ m still hungry afterwards . __eou__ Oh , you don ’ t usually have a starter ? __eou__ No , I might have a soup if it ’ s a cold winter day . __eou__
Harry , do you like the opera ? __eou__ No , not really . __eou__ Why is that ? It is called real art . __eou__ Well , it's very expensive and they're usually singing in another language . That kind of gets on my nerves . __eou__ Yeah , that makes sense . __eou__

The only problem is that it ’ s extremely expensive . __eou__ don ’ t worry . I ’ Ve decided that for your birthday I ’ m going to take you shopping for a new dress . __eou__ really ? I thought you hated shopping ? __eou__ I do , that ’ s why you should appreciate this gift ! __eou__ sure . That ’ s really nice of you .

Do they have it in a size 8 ? __eou__ here you go.On any other day , it would cost me a fortune , but it ’ s on special offer today . __eou__ I think this color isn ’ t quite right for me . Do they have the same dress in white ? __eou__ let me look . Let ’ s see ... they ’ Ve got one in blue , green , pink , black ... and white . Here you are . __eou__ this is perfect !

Do you think that climate change is responsible for the recent floods ? __eou__ It could be . There are floods in this country almost every year , but in recent years they have been more widespread and more frequent . __eou__ It seems that the climate in this country is changing . __eou__ The summers are hotter . The last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years . There have also been stronger winds . __eou__ I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment . __eou__ I think you ’ re right . Climate change naturally over time , but I think that human activities are speeding up the change . I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem . __eou__ Me too . If we don ’ t do something soon , It might be too late . __eou__
I remember you said that you like China because it has cheap beers . __eou__ Yes , unbelievably cheap . Carlsborg is less than $ 1 . __eou__ Why do you drink ? I mean , where does drinking get you ? __eou__ It's fashionable . __eou__ Come on , you don't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity . __eou__ Mary , it's not about the blind following . What matter is I enjoy in drinking . It's like when you get off of work . You're so tired . You need to get relaxed . You can't just turn on the TV and keep watch the programs until you fall asleep . You need to make your after work time more fun . __eou__ How ? By drinking ? __eou__ Drinking is just part of it . I mean , you have a bunch of friends coming by and having fun . You drink and talk . And the more you drink , the more you talk . It makes me so relaxed . __eou__ When did you begin to drink ? __eou__ It's a long time ago . When I first went to a bar to pick up girls there , I saw the most beautiful girl sitting and sipping a coke . Then I went up to her and said ' can I buy you a drink ? ' __eou__ And then ? __eou__ Then I talked to her and got her number . You know what ? When you don't know what to say ? Just drink . __eou__ So you get drunk every day ? __eou__
What is your favorite pastime ? __eou__ Fishing . It's great fun . __eou__ Is it ? Mine is climbing mountains on Sunday mornings . __eou__ No wonder you always look so active . __eou__

They used to be joined at the hip . __eou__ I heard they were just married for 5 months . __eou__ yes , she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things . __eou__ yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden . __eou__ you said it . You know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage . __eou__ maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married . __eou__ yeah . We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners . __eou__ definitely . That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce . __eou__ we've heard so much about Chinese film stars divorcing foreigners . __eou__ that's true.Just hope Wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon . __eou__
Here's Copellini's , my cousin's store . __eou__ Sounds like an Italian name with an “ i ” at the end . __eou__ Admit it .

The Italians do love the sensual forms of the human body . __eou__ Don't we all ... hey ! Your cousin sells gift items ? __eou__ Yeah-all from Italy . See all the saints ? They're important to Roman Catholics . __eou__

But you are such a genius . __eou__ Maybe I've got a higher EQ . I'm not sure . __eou__ Well , perhaps you're right . Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ . __eou__ You can say that again , Jerry . And I'm sure you're high in both of them . With a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks . __eou__ OK , thank you . I'm going to the library , are you coming ? __eou__ Let's go ! __eou__

Maybe she likes you . __eou__ Well , I don't have the guts to ask her out . __eou__ What're you so afraid of ? Just tell her what you're feeling about her . __eou__ I'd totally die if she turned me down . __eou__ But that's better than keeping everything to yourself . You've got to let her know . Come on ! You've got to take a chance ! Even though you are rejected , it's not the end of the world ! There's nothing to lose , is there ? __eou__ I don't know ... Well , maybe , you're right , but how am I going to tell her ? __eou__

Would you mind if I use your tape-recorder ? __eou__ I don't mind . Go ahead . __eou__ I'll give it back to you in a couple of days . __eou__ OK . You can keep it as long as you need . __eou__
What are you doing this weekend ? __eou__ I am not sure . What are you doing ? __eou__ I was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach . __eou__ That sounds like a great idea ! __eou__ Would you be interested in joining me ? __eou__ Sure , I would love to go with you . When would you be leaving ? __eou__ I thought that we could leave around 8 __eou__ That would give us plenty of time to explore . Did you know that there is a music festival on the beach in Santa Barbara ? __eou__ That was part of my plan . __eou__ Well then , I'll see you on Saturday . Thanks for asking me to go with you . __eou__
Congratulations on your success in the competition . That is quite something . __eou__ Thank you . I was lucky this time . __eou__ I think luck played a very small part in your victory . It is solely due to your hard work and efforts . That brings honor to you and joy to us . __eou__ I am flattered . __eou__ It is real word . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
Oh ! You're engaged ! What a beautiful engagement ring ! Who to ? __eou__ Of course Mike . Who else ? We fell in love at first sight . __eou__ When's the wedding going to be ? __eou__ We haven't decided yet . There are a lot of things to sort out , you know . __eou__ Are you having a big wedding ? __eou__ Yes , I've always dream of having a big wedding . __eou__ But what do you say about that ? __eou__ I don't really enjoy big occasions , but I think I ’ ll come round to the idea in the end , It only happens once in a lifetime . __eou__ Perhaps I'll agree with Mike . I couldn't stand a big wedding with many relatives and friends of my parents or my wife whom I'd never met before . __eou__
Who ’ s this ? your girl-friend ? __eou__ No , it ’ s my sister . __eou__ How old is she ? __eou__ She ’ s 18 . __eou__ She is tall ? __eou__ Yes , she is . __eou__ And she is thin , isn ’ t she ? __eou__ Well , just a little thin . __eou__

Hi , Walter ! __eou__ Hi , Sterling ! __eou__ What do you think of our new teacher ? __eou__ Professor Wood ? I think he's a brilliant scientist . __eou__ You're got a point there.But do you think he's a little absent-minded ? __eou__ I guess so . __eou__
I don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit . __eou__ Yeah . Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian . She's almost driving Li Na crazy . __eou__ If I were Li Na , I would ask her if she had done that . __eou__ She a as meek as a lamb . She never goes against anyone or anything . She's as good as gold , you know ? __eou__
Those are today ’ s top stories . Now let ’ s go to John for the weather . John , what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid we ’ re in for a rough weekend , Mary . There is a storm system moving through the East Coast . It will be drizzling all day today , and there ’ s a 60 percent chance of thunderstorms this eve __eou__ That ’ s pretty chilly for the summer ! Will it rain on Saturday ? __eou__ Unfortunately , yes . It will be clear early Saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day . There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Sout __eou__ That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday . __eou__ It gets better on Sunday , though . The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night . It will still be rather cool , with highs in the low 50s . The West Coast will be experiencing some __eou__

What was the last movie you saw ? __eou__ A Korean film called Friends , starring Sang Dong-gun . __eou__ Really ? I've seen that movie , too . __eou__ How did you like the movie ? __eou__ I thought it was pretty good . __eou__ Really ? I can't say I agree . __eou__ You're kidding . The story and acting were outstanding . __eou__ I guess I expected too much from the movie , so I was a bit disappointed . __eou__ I guess it could happen . __eou__
Now the coals are just right . I can start grilling . __eou__ Here you go . I made up the burger patties for you . __eou__ Thanks . Smell the hickory chips ? They give the meat a nice , smoky flavor . __eou__ I'll take over for a while to give you a break . __eou__ Sorry . This is a one-man job . I've got the grill just how I like it , and I've made up my own special sauce . __eou__ Then I'll tell folks the food's ready . Come and get it ! I've always wanted to say that ! __eou__
Jimmy , I ’ d like to wear this robe for tonight cocktail party . What do you think of it ? __eou__ Don ’ t dress like that . You ’ ll make fool yourself . You look stupid in that robe . __eou__ What ? But it is my favorite piece of clothing . __eou__ Maybe it is . But it ’ s out of fashion . __eou__ What am I going to do ? __eou__ Let ’ s go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you . __eou__
Would you mind if I make a suggestion ? __eou__ Of course not , go ahead . __eou__ Maybe you should try to quit smoking . You know it is very bad for your health . __eou__ Well , sure it is . Actually , I have been cutting down the amount since two months ago . I used to smoke a pack of cigarettes for a single day . Now I limit it to 6 cigarettes a day . __eou__ You have made a big progress . Quitting smoking is not an easy job . But it will be rewarding in the long run . __eou__ Thank you for your suggestion . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
What's your favorite sport ? __eou__ Swimming . What about you ? __eou__ Indoors activities , such as chess and gymnastics . __eou__
The Blacks got divorced . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ Mr . Black has been getting a little on the side . __eou__ Really ? I am surprised . He doesn't look like a guy who'd ever cheat on his wife , does he ? __eou__ No , he doesn't . Anyway , his wife found out that he has been two-timing for a long time . __eou__ Well , I am really surprised . By the way , have you done anything behind my back ? __eou__ No . The only thing I've ever done behind your back is zipping you up . __eou__ I like that joke , but I hope it's true . __eou__
You are freaking me out . __eou__ You don ’ t like the dog ? I promise I will never bring it with me ! __eou__
I heard that janet has got a new job . She ’ s working for the united investment group . I hear that they pay very well . __eou__ I heard that too . She must be making a pocket . Well , good for her . __eou__ now , she ’ ll be able to save up for that holiday in the united states . __eou__ yes , she will . At the moment , the exchange rate is very favorable , so she should try to go as soon as possible , while it ’ s cheaper . __eou__ you ’ re right . By the way , did you hear that tom inherited some money recently ? __eou__ really ? I thought his parents had died several years ago . __eou__ they did . He inherited the money form an uncle . I hope he doesn ’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government . __eou__ dying can be very expensive nowadays ! What ’ s he going to do with it ? __eou__ he said that he would probably invest most of it . He ’ s got a well-paid job , so he doesn ’ t need the money to cover day-to day expenses . He just wants some extra money available for when he retires . __eou__ I had some good financial news yesterday too . __eou__ really ? Have you won a fortune in the lottery ? __eou__ no , but I got a pay rise of 5 % and a hours for all the hard work I ’ Ve put in recently . I think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way . __eou__ It certainly was ! So , what are you going to do with your windfall ? __eou__
You haven't spent much time with Sophia lately . Are you speaking to each other at the moment ? __eou__ No , we're not . We've been drifting apart for a while . __eou__ But you two used to do everything together . I thought you really enjoyed each other's company . __eou__ We did , but since she started her new job , all she does is hang out with her new friends from work . __eou__ Can't you hang out with them , too ? __eou__ I could , but all they ever talk about is work , so I always end up feeling left out . __eou__ Maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you . __eou__ I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her . __eou__ It can't be that bad . She was always a really good friend to you . __eou__ You're right . She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore . __eou__ She's probably just excited about her new job . You should give her some time . It would be a shame to lose such a good friend . __eou__ I've given her enough time . I'm over it now . __eou__ I still think you two should try to patch things up . __eou__ I think I just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways . __eou__
Do you love me ? __eou__ I ’ m very fond of you . __eou__ Yes , but do you love me ? __eou__ Why ? You mean a lot to me . __eou__ Why didn ’ t you answer my question ? __eou__ What question ? __eou__ Do you love me ? come on , I ’ m eager to hear . __eou__ You know that I care for you . I .. I ’ m proud of you . __eou__ Don ’ t cherish your words , dear . __eou__ I .. I don ’ t feel like saying it . __eou__
Thanks for inviting me . And happy birthday , Julia . __eou__ Many thanks for your present . I'm so glad you are able to come . __eou__
How may I help you today ? __eou__ I need to make some copies . __eou__ The copier is right over there . __eou__ Does it cost to use it ? __eou__ We do charge to use the machine . __eou__ How much does it cost ? __eou__ We charge ten cents a copy . __eou__ How many copies am I allowed to make ? __eou__ There is no limit to how many copies you can make . __eou__ Would you mind showing me how to use it ? __eou__ Please read the instructions on the copier . __eou__ Oh , okay . Thanks . __eou__
Hello , Mary . What ’ s the matter with you ? You look upset . __eou__ My friend and I was argued with each other . For this , I ’ m very sad . Because I don ’ t want to lose this friend . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry to hear that . I know how you feel . Please don ’ t be sad . __eou__ Thank you , but I really want to relax myself . I ’ m very sorry . __eou__ OK . Don ’ t let it get to you . Goodbye . __eou__
Hi , I haven't seen you in a while . __eou__ Yes , it has been a long time ! __eou__ How long has it been since we last saw each other ? __eou__ I think that we last saw each other two years ago . __eou__ What have you been doing for the past two years ? __eou__ I have been going to graduate school at USC . __eou__ What are you majoring in ? __eou__ I am studying international communications . __eou__ You should easily be able to find a job with that major . __eou__ I am counting on being able to get a good job . __eou__
Here you are at last ! You're half an hour late , you know . __eou__ I'm awfully sorry to have kept you waiting for so long . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ My watch stopped and I didn't know . I certainly need to buy a better one . __eou__
I'm sorry for spilling my drink on your rug . __eou__ There's no need to apologize . __eou__ But I ruined your rug . __eou__ Forget it . It was an accident . __eou__
Hey ! How was your first day of class ? I ’ m in level two and I ’ m loving my class this semester ! It ’ s great being in a class of international students ! __eou__ Mine was ok , except that no one in my class speaks English . I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester . __eou__ That ’ s both fortunate and unfortunate . It ’ s the United Nations in my class ! We have people from all over the world ! There are three Germans , a Pole , a Scottish , two French , an American , a Brazilian , a Chilean , a New Zealander , though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi . Who else do we have ? Oh , we also have a Moroccan , a Togolese , a Pakistani , and two Indonesians ! __eou__ That ’ s quite the array of nationalities . Everyone in my class is from Asia , except me . There are a few South Koreans , several Japanese , Malaysian , Thai , Singaporean , Filipino , Kazakhstan , and one Russian . __eou__ Well , I think you ’ re pretty lucky actually . You ’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture . __eou__ I guess so , but I think it ’ s going to be hard to relate to my classmates , especially with the language barrier . I think I might change classes . __eou__ Don ’ t ! Stay the course ! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful . I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice . __eou__ I highly doubt it . Your girlfriend is Chinese . __eou__ Well , there is that , yes . __eou__
Currently we are looking for business opportunities in northeast China . __eou__ What kind of business do you do ? __eou__ We send analysts to companies that run into financial difficulties . __eou__ What kind of clients do you prefer ? __eou__ Smaller local companies . We specialize in trade & shipping industry . __eou__ I used to work for a shipping company for six years , and I am quite familiar with some managers . Would your like to meet them ? __eou__
Bob ! __eou__ Anne ! I haven't seen you for ages . How've you been ? __eou__ Fine , just fine . And you ? __eou__ Not bad . It really is great to see you again . W here have you been ? __eou__ Guangzhou . I've got a cousin there . __eou__
I didn't like my brother's batting around without doing anything useful . __eou__ Maybe he is trying to find a job . When he finds one , everything will be settled . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__
May I have your attention please ? __eou__ Would you please be quiet , Ladies and Gentlemen ? __eou__ Well , my speech isn't very long . Would you please ... __eou__ Quiet everybody ! __eou__
Excuse me , are you Miss Green ? __eou__ Yes . May I help you ? __eou__ May I introduce myself ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I ’ m a new student in the school . My name ’ s John . __eou__ Nice to meet you , John . __eou__ It ’ s a pleasure to meet you , Miss Green . __eou__
So , have you seen all three The Lord of the Rings movies ? __eou__ Yes , but I didn't really like the third one at all . __eou__ That's the Return of the King , right ? __eou__ Yeah . Even though the customs were brilliant , I didn't think it was as good as the first two . What did you think ? __eou__ I thought the special effects were amazing , but I got a bit confused . The plot was too complicated for me . __eou__ Did you read the books before you watched the movies ? __eou__ No . did you ? __eou__ Yes , I've read them many times . I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters . __eou__ Yes , trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me . __eou__ I also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home . __eou__ Most movies are . Another problem for me was the film was dubbed in German with English subtitles . __eou__ That happens a lot in non-English speaking countries . __eou__ I heard that The Return of the King was nominated for 11 Oscars . __eou__ Actually , they not only had 11 nominations , but they won 11 Oscars , too ! __eou__
Jill , how do you like your new job ? __eou__ I like it . But how did you know about my new job ? I wanted to surprise you . __eou__ I just heard through the grapevine something about you landing a job with some travel agency down town . You can still fill me in on tile details . __eou__ Well , two weeks ago I got a tip about a possible job opening at Ace Travel Agency over on Franklin Avenue . __eou__ Sure , I think I know the place . __eou__ Well , anyway , I made a beeline over to their office , had an interview with the manager , and was told to start work the next day . __eou__ That ’ s really great , jill . So , what do you do there exactly ? __eou__ Right now I ’ m basically just a secretary , but if I ’ m given the chance , I want to become a travel agent there . __eou__ Don ’ t tell me your ’ re already bucking for a promotion . __eou__ No , of course not . I ’ Ve got a lot to learn yet . In the meantime , I just want to be a good secretary and not step on anyone ’ s toes . __eou__ Well I wish you luck . __eou__
Hey , Jack , where's your car ? __eou__ I got rid of that clunker . This is my new one . __eou__ Is that right ? This sure beats the old one ? __eou__ Hop in , I'll give you a ride . __eou__ Ok . Boy , this looks expensive . __eou__ Yeah , it costed a bundle , alright ? __eou__ Wow , this thing can haul . __eou__ Yeah , this sucker is the fastest thing I've ever owned . __eou__ I believe it . Hoo , this car corners like it's on rails . __eou__ We are on the high way . Find the pound shade .. __eou__ Wow , this car can really burn rubber . __eou__ It's a great feeling . __eou__ You made a perfect choice , Jack . __eou__ Thanks , Daisy . __eou__
Woo hoo ! This just might be the start of the rest of my life ! __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I ’ m in the market for a job ! I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for . I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write . I ’ Ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally . And you know I can be charming in interviews . Goodbye my penniless days ! Hello salary and a career ! __eou__ Ben , we ’ re fifteen . What kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__ Oh , just for a position as a gas station attendant . You know , starting at a simple lowly job , just like all the greats before they made it big in the world . __eou__ Uh-huh . __eou__ But I ’ m just in it for the money , right ? How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies ? Besides , I love the smell of gasoline , don ’ t you ? __eou__
Hello , Ellen . __eou__ Hello , Helen , have you heard the news ? There ’ s been a horrible accident . __eou__ Oh , no ! What happened ? __eou__ Hilda Harris husband , Henry had an accident on his way home from work . __eou__ How awful ! Was he hurt ? __eou__ Yes . He was taken to the hospital in an ambulance . __eou__ How did it happen ? __eou__ His car was hit by an express train . It happened at the crossing just behind his house . __eou__ How horrible ! __eou__ He ’ s having an operation in the hospital now . Poor Hilda ! You can imagine how unhappy she is . __eou__ I hope he ’ ll be all right . __eou__ I hope so , too . __eou__
My son has really taken it out of me . He never keeps out of mischief . __eou__ After all , he is a baby . __eou__ Yeah . Anyway he is driving me mad . __eou__
Alright , we need to have a plan here . First of all , which bed do you want ? __eou__ Well , everybody wants the bottom bunk . Why don't we flip a coin for it ? __eou__ Alright . Do you have a coin ? __eou__ Yes . Here's a quarter . I flip it , you call it in the air . __eou__ Heads . __eou__ Sorry , it's tails . You lose . __eou__ Oh , well . So you get the bottom bunk . What about our stereos ? It looks like we both brought our stereos . Probably we only have room for one . __eou__ Your stereo is better than mine . Do you mind if we use yours ? __eou__ No , I don't mind . I just don't know where we can put the speakers in this tiny room . __eou__ Probably we can put one on that counter . And we can put one on the floor by the bed . Over there . __eou__ Alright . That's a good plan . What about the desks ? We have two desks , one by the window and one by the door ? Which one do you want ? __eou__ Well , the desk by the window is nicer , of course . Don't you think ? __eou__ Yes , I agree . __eou__ So since I got the bottom bunk , why don't you get the desk by the window ? That would be more fair . __eou__ Alright . __eou__ I mean , we could flip a coin for it , but I would probably win again . I'm incredibly lucky you know . Especially with girls . __eou__ Is that right ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . __eou__ Well , I hope you let me hang out with you then . Maybe I can learn from you . __eou__ Oh , certainly . Certainly . I'm always willing to help beginners.Just call me Big Brother Dave . __eou__ Are all lucky people so stuck up ? __eou__ C'mon , don't take it seriously ! I'm just kidding . __eou__ Anyway , I get the desk by the window , you get the bottom bunk . That's it . __eou__ Why don't we start unpacking these boxes ? __eou__ I will go get something to eat . You unpack first.Then , when I come back , I'll unpack . __eou__ Alright . See you later . __eou__
let's go swimming . __eou__ But , we just finished eating lunch . __eou__ I know , but I'm really hot . __eou__ I'd strongly recommend that you wait for a while before going swimming . __eou__
Why are you so late ? __eou__ I've been through a lot today . I forgot to set my alarm clock last night , so I woke up late this morning . And what is worse , I missed the school bus . __eou__ That's enough . Sit down . __eou__
I think we should accept his plan . __eou__ I'm afraid I can't agree with you . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Simply because it's not practical at all . __eou__
Not a single email until now ? it's already twelve o'clock . I can't believe it ! __eou__ Can't bear it , right ? I've been there before . I'll feel uncomfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages , like there is something missing . __eou__ Yeah , that's right . If no one sends me text messages , I'll go crazy . __eou__ Actually , this is a kind of addiction called ' infomania ' or ' information overload ' . __eou__ Addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way ! __eou__ Yes , it is . Do you consider a frequent check of your in-coming emails to be an integral part of your working day ? __eou__ Absolutely . __eou__ Do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time ? __eou__ Yeah , it's a must . Otherwise , I may miss important phone calls and text messages . __eou__ Do you open all your IM tools whenever you're using a computer ? __eou__ Yes . MSN , QQ , Skype , Google Talk , Ali wangwang , everything , so that I'll be in touch with all friends and relatives . __eou__ Now I can tell you're definitely addicted to the overflow of information __eou__
Do you like chocolates ? __eou__ It depends . __eou__ Do you like coffee ? __eou__ Um . It ’ s delicious . __eou__ And do you like English food ? __eou__ Not all of it . __eou__
It's getting late . __eou__ Yeah , I'd better head for home . __eou__
There must be something weighing on your mind . What is it ? __eou__ Dad , I lost mum's necklace . I'm afraid she will scold me . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . I'll buy a new necklace as same as the old one . __eou__ It is so kind of you , Dad . __eou__
Could you tell me the time ? __eou__ Pardon ? __eou__ What time is it , please ? __eou__ It's 9:30 . __eou__
Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick . __eou__ Well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything . __eou__ Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous , and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back . __eou__ I ’ m thinking of taking you back home . I thought we could have a nice evening , but you ’ re always so negative . __eou__ I ’ m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage . __eou__ You see , that ’ s what I ’ m talking about , I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore . __eou__ Next time , go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings . __eou__ Well he ’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories . __eou__ Love stories ? More like one-night-stands . __eou__ Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours , they ’ re no saints . __eou__ My friends ? Fat ? What about those whales you call friends ? __eou__ You ’ re unbearable , you can walk home , I ’ m leaving . __eou__
How about going swimming ? __eou__ Ok . Where should we go ? __eou__ Why don ’ t we down to the pool ? It ’ s not too far from here . __eou__ Fine . I ’ ll be ready in a minute . __eou__
I want to go to china for sight-seeing.What do you think of it , Mum ? __eou__ Why not ? China is a wonderful country . __eou__ Will you go with me , too ? __eou__ No , I'm afraid not now . I'm too busy . __eou__
Mr . : Are you Mary Lin ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Mr . : I'm Mr . Rogers , your homeroom teacher . __eou__ Where should I sit ? __eou__ Mr . : Why don't you sit behind Brad ? __eou__ Who's Brad ? __eou__ Mr . : He's that guy in the blue shirt . __eou__ When does the first period begin , by the way ? __eou__ Mr . : As soon as the bell rings after the morning announcement . __eou__

It's lucky that I have got a good partner . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
I ’ m going to the beauty parlor . Do you want to come too ? __eou__ Sure . Let ’ s go . What are you going to have done ? __eou__ I want to have a foot massage and haircut . __eou__ A foot massage sounds like a great idea . They are very relaxing . I ’ d also like to have a mudpack on my face . It ’ s supposed to help with your complexion . __eou__ Good idea . We should also pedicures and manicures . __eou__ This could become a very expensive trip to be beauty parlour ! __eou__ I think it ’ s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . Don ’ t you agree ? __eou__ Oh , I agree . We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress . __eou__ Maybe we should try a thai massage too . __eou__ What ’ s special about a thai massage ? __eou__ That ’ s when the masseuse walk on your back and massage you with her feet . __eou__ Sounds painful ! __eou__

I have twenty four credits this time around . That might be a bit much . __eou__ I'll say . The regular eighteen is just about all I can handle myself . __eou__
I went bungee jumping yesterday . It was so exciting . __eou__ Do you really enjoy such dangerous sports ? __eou__ Yes , They are great fun and very challenging , too .

Ok ... I ’ ll talk to you later . Bye __eou__ Carrie , are you ok ? You seem a bit down . __eou__ I just got off the phone with my boyfriend . He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing . It ’ s so hard to talk to him at times . __eou__ Maybe it ’ s just that he is stressed out from work or something . He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know . __eou__ Yeah but , he is always in a really foul mood . I try to find out what ’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but , he always shuts down and brushes me off . __eou__ Men are like that you know.They can feel nervous , anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness . __eou__ I guess you are right . What do you think I should do ? He wasn ’ t always this grouchy you know ... __eou__ Talk to him , try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn ’ t work , I say get rid of him and get a new one ! __eou__ You are something else you know that ? __eou__

I really hate my job ! __eou__ Are you available on Sunday ? __eou__ Yes , that's my only day off until Thursday . __eou__ Ok , well , my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ? __eou__ That'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ? __eou__ It's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city . __eou__ What should I bring with me ? __eou__ We've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger . __eou__ I can just use my beach towel . I love lazing around in the sun . __eou__ Do you like surfing ? __eou__ I've actually never tried . Do you have a surfboard ? __eou__ We've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun ! __eou__ I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ? __eou__ You'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money . __eou__ Ok , where and when should I meet you ? __eou__ We'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square ! __eou__

Could you help me prepare for my presentation on Friday ? __eou__ I would love to help you prepare for your presentation . __eou__ I hate to ask you to do something like that . __eou__ This will not interfere with my work . I promise you that . __eou__ When could we get together ? __eou__ I could easily give you some time tomorrow night . __eou__ Would you like to meet me at the coffee house next door ? __eou__ Yes , and could you write down anything you might be having trouble with ? __eou__ I'll come prepared . __eou__ Goodbye until then . I promise you that you'll do well after we meet . __eou__
But his wife has wide relations . You may ask her for advice . __eou__ Stop talking about her . She gives me goose bumps . I never wish to be in her sight . __eou__ She is pretty . Many men praise her highly . __eou__ Many people , many tastes . She looks pretty , but the way she speaks gives you goose bumps . I feel sick of it . __eou__
I heard you were teaching English over there.Tell me about it . Did you like it ? __eou__ Oh , yes , it was very interesting . __eou__ What were the schools like ? __eou__ Oh , I didn't actually teach in the schools . I taught after school . I taught in English institutes . __eou__ But you taught children , yes ? __eou__ Yes . That's right.But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America.At least as far as studying is concerned.Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school . __eou__ They actually study after school ? __eou__ That's right.After their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or English.They are very serious about learning over there . __eou__ Hmm . That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . Don't they ever relax ? __eou__ Of course they do.You know , Eliza , before I went over there I thought the same thing . I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much.But now that I've worked there , and taught them , I feel it is a good thing.Their parents are very concerned about their education . More than American parents are . And that is good . American kids don't study enough . __eou__ Asian cultures value learning very much . I know that . __eou__ So it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education.They would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing . I don't think that's a bad thing . I think it's a good thing.In America , too many parents don't pay attention . __eou__ But aren't the kids tired out ? I mean , they go to school all day , and then they go to school in the evening too . __eou__ As an English teacher , I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible . I tried to have a good time with my classes . The students often enjoyed it.And if the students enjoyed it , they learned more . So it was a good experience . __eou__ Are the kids in Taiwan very obedient ? __eou__ That's a stereotype we Americans have.We think that Asian kids are very obedient and quiet.But it's not true . There are plenty of naughty kids too . __eou__ Hmm . I know you taught in Costa Rica also.Which did you like better--Costa Rica or Taiwan ? __eou__ I don't know . In Costa Rica , I taught adults.So it was a very different thing . So I really can't compare . __eou__
the dinner was really good . It knocked my socks off . __eou__ that's very kind of you to say so . Let's try some after-dinner wines . __eou__ great . Sweet wines are my favorite . They always make a great finish to a decisions meal . __eou__ do you prefer brandy or ports . __eou__ port , please . __eou__ excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor . __eou__ the port is exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ? __eou__ yes . You always have a good nose for wines . __eou__ next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine . __eou__ oh , what's that ? __eou__ it's made from naturally frozen grapes . __eou__ why not ? It sounds great . __eou__ oh , here's to your health . __eou__ thanks . Cheers . __eou__ cheers . __eou__
Hey Mike . What are you doing tonight ? __eou__ Nothing planned . How about you ? __eou__ Work is kicking my ass . I'm so stressed . Let's go grab a drink . __eou__ I'm always up for a drink . To tell you the truth , it's been quite stressful here too . __eou__ I say we get drunk tonight . I don't want to think about all this stuff . __eou__ But we have to work tomorrow . __eou__ We won't stay out too late . I just need to forget about work . __eou__ I hear ya . Let's do it . __eou__
My wife and I didn't used to spend this much money . __eou__ What's changed ? __eou__ My wife has been pregnant for 7 months . __eou__ I see . I guess diapers and baby food are expensive.Bringing up children is not easy . __eou__ My wife will be going back to work soon . __eou__ You should have more money then . __eou__ Yes.We will need milk powder and bassinet . __eou__
We came too early . There're still three hours before the performance starts . __eou__ I know . Sorry , I shouldn't have rushed you , but I just couldn't stay at home and wait . __eou__ Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ? __eou__ Why not ? I'd love to do that . __eou__ Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art . ( They come to the museum of the Beijing Opera art . ) __eou__ Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ? __eou__ Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ? __eou__ I surely do . They must have had advanced machines in ancient China to do that . __eou__ No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework . __eou__ Unbelievable ! I could never do that . __eou__ Very few can . That's why these clothes only appear in the museum . __eou__ Listen ! Some people are singing outside . Is it the opera ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I heard there was an opera fans club . They are probably practicing now . Wanna have a look ? __eou__ Yes , let's do it . __eou__ Follow me . Make sure not to interrupt them . __eou__ Of course not . We don't do that . __eou__
I'm worried sick that she might leave me one day . __eou__ I'll teach you how to keep her . __eou__ Tell me , please . __eou__ After you've solved this problem for me . __eou__
Anna , that outfit looks wonderful on you ! The color goes with your trousers perfectly . __eou__ Thanks , Carla . That's quite a compliment coming from you . You always dress so tastefully . __eou__ Well , that dress certainly shows your good taste . It must have cost a lot . __eou__ No , not much . I got it on sale at the mall - 60 % off . __eou__ Really ? You're an amazing bargain hunter ! Next time there's a sale , promise you'll let me tag along with you . __eou__ It's a promise . __eou__
Well , how did you enjoy your seaside trip ? __eou__ It was fun , I tell you . __eou__ Tell me about it , will you ? __eou__ Well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . It was a magnificent sight ! __eou__ Did you stop at the Fall for some pictures ? __eou__ Sure , we wouldn't miss that for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour . __eou__ You were lucky then . __eou__ Yeah , we spent the whole morning under the tall trees . We had our picnic there , too . __eou__ What did you do after that ? __eou__ We went for a swim in the sea . That was the biggest part of the day . Just look at my nice tan ! __eou__ So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday . __eou__ Yes , you are right . And I was so tired out that I fell asleep on the way back . My muscles are still stiff from the swim yesterday . __eou__
Where can I buy textbooks ? __eou__ First , you need to have the list of books for your class . Do you have that ? __eou__ Yes , I have that . __eou__ Well , when you have that , you can take it over to the bookstore . Can you find it ? __eou__ No , I don't know where the bookstore is . __eou__ Just pass the gym and it's the first door on your left . Were you aware that you can also turn in your old textbooks for money ? __eou__ Really ? How can I do that ? __eou__ Take your used textbooks with you and give them to the representative near the entrance . He will pay you for them . Are you going today ? __eou__ No , I can't make it today . __eou__ I could help you with buying your books if you meet me there at 1 __eou__ No , thanks . I'm good . __eou__ I'll see you later then . Have a great day ! __eou__
I don't like the merry-go-round . __eou__ But , I want to ride it , Daddy . __eou__ Ok , I guess it's worthy of two yuan . __eou__ Great . Let's go . __eou__
Hey Lydia , what are you reading ? __eou__ I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ? __eou__ It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ? __eou__ January 5th . __eou__ Let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers ! __eou__ That ’ s bogus . I don ’ t feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense . __eou__ No , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize . __eou__ Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ? __eou__ A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you ! __eou__
Oh , my god . How can you stand living in such a messy dorm ? __eou__ Our place is spotlessly clean , compared with others . __eou__ Have you even tried to clean it once since you moved in at the beginning of the semester ? __eou__ In fact , I just swept the floor three days ago . __eou__ I think we need to restart the dormitory sanitation inspection system . __eou__ I bet nobody will care about it . __eou__
Then I'll take them . How much ? __eou__ $ 120.The small gift box is complementary . __eou__ Here is $ 150.Keep the change . __eou__ Thank you ! Have a nice day ! __eou__ You too.Bye . __eou__

Are you alright , Ethan ? You don't seem to be as cheerful as you normally are . __eou__ To be honest , Ava , I've just had a really bad day . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ First , I slept through my alarm and ended up two hours late to work . __eou__ What did your boss say ? __eou__ He told me that if I showed up late one more time , he'd fire me . He's so mean ! __eou__ That's horrible . Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work ? __eou__ That was my second time . The first time , I was in a car accident . __eou__ Is your boss Chinese ? __eou__ No , he's from Australia . Before I met him , I thought Australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going . I had no idea he'd be so fussy about things . __eou__ What are you going to do ? __eou__ I think I'm going to look for another job . I need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss . __eou__ That sounds like a sensible plan . Do you want me to help you with your job search ? __eou__ That's very generous of you . Thanks for the offer . __eou__ Don't mention it . That's what friends are for ! __eou__
Victoria , you are back from vacation ! How was it ? __eou__ To tell the truth , I feel tired . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ I had to visit all my relatives . __eou__

I just feel very lonely in this city . I miss my family . __eou__ Oh , I know . Sometimes I have the same feeling with you . But you'd better not be so emotional . __eou__ Can you stay and accompany me for a while ? __eou__ Sure , no problem . You can call me any time you are alone from now on . __eou__ Thank you so much . You are so sweet . __eou__ Not at all . We are friends . __eou__

There are so many different people here . I expected mostly athletes and rappers . __eou__ You'll find some of those here , too . But not if you don't shake it up ! There's an African saying , “ If you can talk , you can sing ! If you can walk , you can dance ! ” __eou__ Then I'll just shut up and sit down ! __eou__
What book is that ? __eou__ I just bought a new atlas . I ’ m looking this map of the world . Look at Russia ! That ’ s a vast country . __eou__ Canada , china , and the use are huge too . __eou__ There are several tiny countries in the world too . Countries like Monaco are smaller than many cities . __eou__ Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia . European countries are relatively small . France looks quite big in Europe , but compared to many countries in other continents , it ’ s not very l __eou__ Britain is half the size of france , but great Britain is still one of the largest islands in the world . __eou__ The thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . Russia and Canada have enormous areas of ice and forest . __eou__
It ’ s going to a volleyball match between the economic department and foreign language department this afternoon . Are any of you keen on volleyball ? __eou__ Sorry , I ’ m not a volleyball-fun . I ’ d rather play football . How about you , Mr . Wang . ? Are you interested in volleyball ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid not . My favorite is boots-running . I don ’ t care about games . __eou__
Tonight is a party night ! What drinks do you think we need ? __eou__ Well , not everyone wants to drink beer . Make sure there are some soft drinks and juice . Nothing's as refreshing as iced drinks on a hot day . __eou__ I don't think we need too much in the way of soft drinks , Two super bottles of Cola should cover everyone . What about wine ? __eou__ Just buy a cask of wine . Have you bought ice yet ? __eou__ No , once I fill the tub with beer , I'll get the ice . The beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice . The cooler , the better . __eou__ I think a bottle of champagne would be a good idea . It's appetizing and tasty . __eou__ Well , if you say so . Personally speaking , I'd rather die of thirst than drink champagne . __eou__
Hi , John ! I haven ’ t seen you for ages . __eou__ Hi ! Yes , it ’ s been a long time . I ’ m really glad to see you . __eou__ I ’ m glad to see you , too . How ’ Ve you been ? __eou__ Just fine . How is everything with you ? __eou__ Not bad . I finally bought a house . It ’ s an old one , but built really solid . It is close to here . Do you want to come over for lunch ? __eou__ I ’ d like that , but I ’ m flying home this afternoon , and I told my parents I ’ d meet them at the airport for lunch . __eou__ OK , next time you ’ re here . __eou__ That ’ s a deal . __eou__ I heard that you moved to Florida . __eou__ Yes , I ’ m in Titusville . The space shuttle is launched from near there . I ’ Ve seen a lot of space shuttle launches . __eou__ Tell me more . __eou__ The shuttle launches are beautiful . I saw one that took off at midnight . The whole sky got bright . __eou__ Sounds great ! __eou__ I ’ m pretty happy living there . __eou__ I want to see Disney World , Sea World , Universal Studios , and Weeki-Watchee Springs . __eou__ I ’ Ve been to all of them . __eou__ I ’ m jealous . I ’ Ve never been to Florida . __eou__ The Sunshine State certainly is worth visiting . Come down for a vacation sometime . I ’ ll take you to Disney World . __eou__ That sounds great ! I ’ ll take you up on that invitation . __eou__ I hope you do . And keep in touch , OK ? __eou__ I sure will . __eou__ Here ’ s my business card . Send me an email once in a while . __eou__ Count on it . And here ’ s my card . Don ’ t hesitate to call me anytime . __eou__ Thank you . I ’ d better get going . I don ’ t want to be late for lunch . Mom would worry . __eou__ Well , I ’ m really glad we bumped into each other . Have a good trip . __eou__ Take good care of yourself , Mary . __eou__ I will . Good-bye . __eou__ Bye-bye ! __eou__
I can't decide what I should do . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ Should I date Tom or should I date Harry ? __eou__ That's easy . If I were you , I'd date me ! __eou__
I'll tell you something that's good about action movies . The special effects are great ! __eou__ But they are so silly ! They're not art ! __eou__ That's just your personal prejudice . Do you know who was the director of the movie Titanic ? __eou__ James Cameron , of course . __eou__ Well , did you know he was also the director of The Terminator ? __eou__ Well , nobody's perfect ! __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I am interested in applying for graduate school in America . __eou__ We have some catalogues from U . S . universities . You may check in the reference stacks over there . __eou__ Can you recommend some universities with good graduate schools ? __eou__ Well , generally in the U . S . each university has its own outstanding fields . But the graduate school accepts no applications after January 29th . __eou__ Oh , no . It's already February 5th . __eou__ So you have to apply to begin the first semester next year . __eou__ I will think about it . __eou__
Can you be serious for a moment , we've been dating for 6 months now , I really like you . I'd like to take a relationship to the next level . __eou__ So what are you trying to say to me ? __eou__ It feels like you are not dedicate to our relationship . It seems like you treat it as a just casual dating . __eou__ How should I say it ? __eou__ I don't want to be like this . I think we should get step further . __eou__ It has only been 6 months , our relationship hasn't had a chance to maturate . We are still have some hurdle we have to jump over . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Last week I saw Brain kissing you on the cheek . __eou__ It was only the cheek . __eou__ That is ok , then ? Starts on the cheek ? pretty soon you french kiss in the back on his car . __eou__ Oh , that is ridiculous . __eou__ So is it ok if I kiss other women on the cheek ? __eou__ Definitely not . __eou__ You see , we still have hurdle . __eou__
How did you get around over there ? Did you rent cars ? __eou__ No , that would be too expensive . We used the train system.We bought a special pass called a Enrail pass . It lets people use the train wherever they want , as often as they want . __eou__ I've heard about Enrail passes.So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot . __eou__ Yes , they do . I wish we Americans had a better train system . __eou__ I know . Our train system is lousy.And besides , Americans love their cars too much . __eou__ I agree . And probably the automobile companies are too powerful.They never allowed the government to develop trains . __eou__ It's too bad for the environment . So much pollution from cars . __eou__ Americans love cars for different reasons , I think.One reason is that we are very individualistic.And cars are a very individual way of getting around.Americans like the freedom of driving around by themselves.They don't want to ride in a train or bus with a group of people . __eou__ Yes , I agree . I think it is a cultural characteristic.It would be very hard to get us Americans to change this.But you know what ? Probably , in the future , Americans will have to change . __eou__ Why do you say " have to " ? __eou__ Because the earth's environment can't tolerate cars forever . I think cars are already causing global warming.When the problem gets more serious , world governments will have to start limiting car use . __eou__ Maybe you're right . They will have to develop alternative transportation.But it will be hard in America . Too many people are used to cars.Even in our movies cars are very important . __eou__ Wow ! I didn't notice the time.It ' s almost noon . I have to get home . __eou__ Do you want me to give you a ride ? __eou__ No , no problem . I have my car in the parking ramp around the corner . __eou__ Alright.Well , I'll stay here and have another coffee . Nice running into you . __eou__ See you around . __eou__
It's raining outside , Catherine , it's too bad.What ' s the weather like in your hometown ? __eou__ It's very hot , the temperature is often over 40C . __eou__ Do you like the weather in Seattle ? __eou__ Not really.But I like it in spring and fall . I don't like it in winter . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ The winter is very rainy , I don't like the rainy day . __eou__ What about the weather in Boston ? __eou__ I lived there for three years . I like summer but I don't like winter . __eou__ Is it very cold in winter ? __eou__ Yes , it is.But it's nice in spring and fall . __eou__
I'll help you with your homework . __eou__ I appreciate that . __eou__
That's a cool jacket . Where did you get it ? __eou__ I bought it when I was on vacation in Nepal . __eou__
I want to say goodbye to everyone . __eou__ You ’ re leaving so soon . When are you off ? __eou__ I ’ m catching the nine fifteen train tomorrow morning . __eou__ how about I come and see you off ? __eou__ You really don ’ t need to . __eou__ Ok . I ’ ll miss you . I hope we can see each other again soon . __eou__ I hope so , too . Thank you , Lily . Thank you for everything . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__ Please say goodbye to the rest of the family for me . __eou__ Ok . Take care . I hope you have a good journey . __eou__ Thank you . Remember to look me up if you ’ re ever in Washington . __eou__ Of course . I will . __eou__ Goodbye , then . Thanks again for everything . __eou__
Herman , why are you so excited ? __eou__ I have met a beautiful girl . __eou__ Have you fallen in love ? __eou__ Yes . At first sight . __eou__ Can you describe the situation at that time ? __eou__ At that time her back was ramrod straight as she sailed by , her tone is best , neither over-passionate , nor too cold . __eou__ What's her outlook ? __eou__ She was pretty , her hair was the color of rich dark chocolate , waving gently to her shoulders . Her complexion was clear and golden . __eou__
Where is Tom ? __eou__ He is in the bedroom and fallen asleep . __eou__ What ? It ’ s only 9 p . m . Now . Why today he went to bed so early ? __eou__ He ran four miles and came back dead beat . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__
What an attractive blouse , You look so pretty in this blue dress ! __eou__ Really ? Thank you . I bought it in Spring Street yesterday . __eou__ It's very nice.It goes well with your skirt . __eou__ Thank you.It ' s very nice of you to say so . __eou__ Not at all.This dress certainly shows your good taste . __eou__ That's quite a compliment coming from you . __eou__
What college are you attending ? __eou__ I am in Nanjing University . I am a junior . __eou__ Why did you choose to attend that college ? __eou__ Because it enjoys great reputation and it is located in my favorite city Nanjing . __eou__ What kind of college is it ? __eou__ Ii is distinguished for the strength of law and foreign languages studies .. __eou__
How do you like the play ? __eou__ It is very dull , and the production isn't very satisfactory , either . __eou__ You're absolutely right . I think the acting could be better . __eou__ To be fair , both the costumes and scenery are marvelous . __eou__ Maybe you're right . But I really don't like it . __eou__ Well , we'd better go to a musical comedy next time . I think the one we saw last month was very good . __eou__ Yes , they had constant changes of scene , and I love variety . __eou__ Me , too . I hate to sit there and look at the same stage scenery one scene after another . __eou__
Which team has won ? __eou__ Neither . The game ended in two all . __eou__ But I still think AC milan's defence seems better organized . __eou__ But the Brazilian is tougher . __eou__
I am really tired of Terry . __eou__ Oh , but I suppose he has lots of talents . __eou__ He is a bootlicker . I suppose that is because he is quick on the uptake . __eou__
What are you studying all day long for ? It ’ s summer vacation ! __eou__ I know ! I hate it ! But I ’ m taking this crash course in math . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I have to take my exams for getting into the university , so I need to prepare . __eou__ Do you think it will help ? __eou__ It has to ! I ’ Ve been studying every day , eight hours a day ! I don ’ t know , but the school has a great success record . __eou__ Hmm ... Maybe I should sign up too . __eou__ I ’ ll pick up an application form for you at school tomorrow . __eou__
Have you seen the new Hannibal Letter movie ? __eou__ Oh , yes . You ? __eou__ Yes . What did you think of it ? __eou__ I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it.What did you think of it ? __eou__ I liked it , too . It was scary , but not disgusting . I always enjoy watching Anthony Hopkins . He's brilliant . __eou__ Mmm . That's what I thought , too . And I always enjoy watching Anthony Hopkins . __eou__ Oh , yes , he is brilliant . What's the name of the young actor ? __eou__ Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . __eou__ Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together . __eou__
Mary seems depressed . What ’ s the matter ? __eou__ She didn ’ t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day ’ s hard work . __eou__ Poor girl ! __eou__
Hi charles , I want you know that i finally found an apartment in haitian . __eou__ You did ? that is great ! __eou__ Yeah , I am having a party this saturday night , a sort of house warming , and i want to invite you . are you busy ? __eou__ No i am free , i will be there , what time the thing starting ? __eou__ Around seven . __eou__ Ok , great , should i bring anything ? __eou__ No , but thanks for offering , actually could you bring some fold-up chairs for people if you have any ? I am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat , do you have any ? __eou__ sure , I will be happy to bring a few , what is the address ? __eou__ Don't worry , I will come to pick you up at about six thirty . __eou__ Got it . __eou__
Did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ? __eou__ No , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend . __eou__ Yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go . __eou__ They must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood . __eou__ They're also one of the richest couples . They have so much money and they can buy almost anything they want . __eou__ I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars . __eou__ Did either one of them win an Oscar this year ? __eou__ I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything . __eou__ Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ? __eou__ Yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous . __eou__ I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves . __eou__ People in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated . __eou__ I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you . __eou__ That's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go . __eou__ Thank goodness we're not rich and famous ! __eou__ Being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich . __eou__
Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! __eou__ What ? What did you buy ? __eou__ It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! __eou__ What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? __eou__ There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . __eou__ And ? __eou__ So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . __eou__ And it's a brick ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? __eou__ I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . __eou__ So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . __eou__ Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . __eou__ But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? __eou__ He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . __eou__ Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! __eou__ C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . __eou__ That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . __eou__ You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? __eou__
What do you like to do in your spare time ? __eou__ I am a girl of many interests . I like dance , chess , collecting stamps , travelling and taking photos . __eou__ What kind of dance do you like ? __eou__ I like rumba and tango . __eou__ Great . I am not interested in Chinese chess . It is too difficult for me . __eou__ You can learn Chinese checkers or military chess . Both of them are much easier . __eou__ OK , I will try . As for stamp , don't you think it is an expensive hobby ? __eou__ Yes , it is . But it is full of fun and knowledge . What about you , what do you like to do as hobby ? __eou__ I like gardening . I take care of them everyday . I like those flowers and the swing in my garden . If the weather is nice , I would like to lie on the lawn . __eou__ Sounds pleasant . __eou__
I've heard of ground-level ozone but can you explain what it is exactly ? __eou__ Yes , it's one of the main air pollutants . Factories don't emit it directly into the air . It's actually formed when nitrogen oxides and VOC emissions come into contact with heat and sunlight . __eou__ Sorry ? What does VOC stand for ? __eou__ Oh , Vous are ' volatile organic compounds ' . That's a technical term for solvents or other chemicals found in things like paint . __eou__ So , what damage does ozone do to the environment ? __eou__ Well , it can cause smog , which can affect people's health - especially people with breathing difficulties . __eou__
I heard Tom was caught stealing something again in the supermarket . __eou__ Really ? He deserves it ! They should teach him a good lesson . __eou__ But the word is his brother would go bail for him . Last time it ’ s his father who went bail for him . __eou__ Then he is really lucky . __eou__
Do you have the day off today ? How come you're not at work now ? __eou__ I don't have the day off . Our labor union is staging a nationwide strike today , all of the workers in our department are supporting the labor union by participating and not going in to work this week . __eou__ Are you serious ? Why would they have to go to such extreme measures like a strike ? Doesn't your company have a pretty good corporate image ? I'll bet the folks at headquarters are going nuts over something as serious as a strike ... __eou__ It happens quite often , actually.Whenever there arises a dispute between the union and the executive group , the first thing they do is to call a strike . Usually it only lasts a day or two before both sides can come to an agreement and we start work again . Anyhow , it's a nice , unanticipated holiday ... __eou__
Are you going to take the job ? __eou__ I'll have to sleep on it . __eou__
We ’ re going to the movies . Will you join us ? __eou__ I ’ m very sorry I can ’ t . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid I have some business to attend to . __eou__ Then would you like to have lunch with us ? __eou__ I ’ d love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now . __eou__ Would you like me to give you a lift ? __eou__ No , thanks . His home is not far and I can walk there . __eou__ Come on . It ’ s no trouble at all . __eou__ Ok , thank you . __eou__
What sports do you think women excel at most ? __eou__ I think women excel in every sport except the ones that are taboo for us to join in , like football . __eou__ I mean which ones are they better at than men ? __eou__ Why do you care ? Women and men are different all around . I don't think they can be compared . __eou__ That's a good point . Let me change my question . What sports do women like best ? __eou__ Well , I know some women who love golf and I know others who love contact sports . __eou__ Are you saying that women can't be generally categorized ? __eou__ Are you suggesting that anyone can be ? __eou__
I am going on my first date tonight . Can you give me some suggestions about what to wear ? __eou__ Well , I think you look very pretty in your polka dot purple dress with your hair piled at the rear . That makes you very graceful and mysterious . __eou__ Yeah , that's a good idea . Let me try it . __eou__ Remember to match it with your glittering star-shaped necklace . Very attractive on formal occasions . __eou__ Do I look more mature in the highheel shoes ? __eou__ Sure , more elegant and taller . __eou__ I shall wear light make-up instead of heavy . The face powder will lighten my skin color . __eou__ If I were your date , I would be so charmed by you . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
How's your new car ? __eou__ Perfect ! Couldn't be better . __eou__ You made a good choice , then ? __eou__ It's just what I want . __eou__ No regrets . __eou__ I am really pleased with it . __eou__ I am glad you are happy . __eou__ It's super . __eou__
Hey , let's eat out tonight . __eou__ What's the occasion ? You won the lottery ? __eou__ No . Just want to relax a little bit . You don't have to win the lottery to relax , do you ? __eou__ Well , I am kind of broke . __eou__ Come on . It's on me . __eou__ Really ? It's very nice of you . __eou__ Don't be silly . I'll take you anywhere you wanna go . __eou__ Wonderful ! You know what ? I wish you wanted to relax everyday . __eou__ Dream on ! __eou__
Do you mind retiring earlier ? __eou__ No , I don't mind in the least . I want to do something of my own . What about you ? __eou__ I do . I don't know what to do after I retire . I'd like to work till I drop . __eou__
who is your favorite NBA star ? __eou__ Kobe Bryant , of course . __eou__ Kobe ? I know him , the key guy of the Lakers , a heck of a NBA player . He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense . __eou__ He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand . __eou__ Maybe he is not good ay rebounding ? __eou__ indeed , no man can be perfect . He is just so-so in crashing the boards . Usually he plays shooting guard . Rebounding might not be his strong suit . __eou__ Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics . Did you go to the match between China and USA ? __eou__ who wouldn't ! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him . __eou__ well then , what are your spoils ? __eou__ well , nothing more than a jumble of photographs . __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ Have you got the latest ONXIU magazine ? __eou__ Yes , but it's checked out . __eou__ What a pity ! I missed it again . __eou__ It's popular you know . You want to reserve it ? __eou__ Yes , please . __eou__ Fill out this form and we will send you a note when we get the book . __eou__ Thank you . What shall I do when I check out these books ? __eou__ Take the card , and fill in your name and library card number . __eou__ Thank you so much . __eou__
What do you like to do with your free time ? __eou__ Study English . __eou__ You mean you like to study English ? Why ? __eou__ It gives me great satisfaction . __eou__ Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction.It ' s hard work . __eou__ I don't mind the work . I think it's worthwhile . __eou__
Good news ! __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ The state of economy is starting to go up in our country . __eou__ That ’ s just the short in the arm we need . __eou__
Mary ? Are you still there ? __eou__ Yes . What do you want ? __eou__ Did your bid win ? __eou__ What do you care , dork ? __eou__ Hey ! I'm trying to be nice , and you still want to fight ! Did you get the statue or not ? __eou__ You mean fat boy ? __eou__ Sorry . I take that back . I mean the copper Buddha you wanted . __eou__
Do you mind if I sit here ? __eou__ Of course not , help yourself . __eou__ What are you studying ? __eou__ I have a test tomorrow . __eou__
The final examination will be held at the end of this month . Have you made good preparation ? __eou__ Sure . I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year . __eou__ Are you sure you can do well this year ? __eou__ I am 100 % certain . __eou__ According to what you did last time , I have my doubts . __eou__ I am sure I can get a 95 this time . __eou__
He always likes to say something as if all his geese are swans . __eou__ I know this characteristic of him . So I never think seriously of his words . __eou__ Yeah . This is a clever way to be in contact with such a person . __eou__ It seems that you don't like him . __eou__ You like to communicate with him ? __eou__

What is your favorite ? __eou__ I love anything with chocolate the best . __eou__ I like chocolate myself . __eou__ Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like ? __eou__ I really don't like any ice cream with nuts in it . __eou__ I haven't ever cared for that myself . __eou__ Have you ever had garlic ice cream ? __eou__ That sounds absolutely disgusting ! __eou__ It was . Let's stick with the regular choices today , though . __eou__
Hi Colin . How are you feeling today ? __eou__ Oh , I feel ok but I ’ m still very tired . __eou__ It's probably jet lag . __eou__ I think so . One minute I feel quite awake , and the next I feel very tired . __eou__ Do you want to visit any tourist spots in the city ? __eou__ Oh yes , I'm very interested in Chinese history so I ’ d like to visit the Summer Palace . __eou__ Good idea . I ’ d be very happy to go there . __eou__
Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long __eou__ It ’ s a skill . What can I say ? I don ’ t know why , I just have a long routine . __eou__ Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . __eou__ Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , butoften times I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . __eou__ True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ? __eou__ Not funny . __eou__
Did it take you a long time to quit smoking ? __eou__ No . I just went cold turkey , and I never smoked again . __eou__

I ’ d love it if come . I can get you a couple of tickets.So you can bring a friend if you like . __eou__ Sure.That would be great.Good luck . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
You like Titanic ? That movie is so cheesy . __eou__ It's not cheesy ! It's romantic . When it first came out , I saw it in the theaters five times in one week . __eou__ Really ? Well the special effects might have been good in 1997 , but when you watch it today they make the film seem really cheesy . __eou__ Alright , maybe it's a little bit cheesy . But come on , isn't it fun to go to a cheap flick once in a while ? __eou__ Actually , I have to admit that you're right . I like some pretty cheesy movies too . I love Arnold Schwarzenegger action flicks , especially " Terminator . " __eou__ Haha , that's definitely a cheesy movie too . Did you watch it over and over again ? __eou__ Well ... I saw it only once , but for the next two months when I talked to people , I pretended I was the Terminator . __eou__
I see that there are Olympic mascots in your car . __eou__ Yes . I am very interested in the Olympic Games , and I'm especially excited about 2008 Beijing Olympics . __eou__ Me , too . I want to be a volunteer for 2008 Beijing Olympics . __eou__ That's cool . Care for a little quiz on that ? __eou__ No problem . I'm an ' Olympic expert ' . __eou__ Wow , you've talked the talk . Now it's time to walk the walk . Here we go . First , can you tell me something about the ancient Olympics ? __eou__ The ancient Olympics originated in ancient Greece . __eou__ Good . Why do people name it Olympics ? __eou__ They name it after the place where it was first held . __eou__ Who started the modern Olympics ? __eou__ This question is a piece of cake . A Frenchman named Baron de Coubertin . __eou__ What did people call him ? __eou__ Of course he was called ' the father of the Olympics ' . __eou__ What did he do for restoring the Olympics ? __eou__ He once made a speech on the ‘ Renaissance of the Olympics ' . __eou__ Well , that's for all . Excellent ! __eou__ I've told you I'm an expert . __eou__
Can we go to the beach on foot ? __eou__ Oh , it's too far to walk there.We can take a bus . __eou__ Is the bus station close by ? __eou__ Yeah , it's a block away down the street . __eou__
I really should be on my way . __eou__ Oh , don ’ t go yet . Let ’ s at least have one more . __eou__ No , thank you . I can ’ t . __eou__ It ’ s too bad that you have to leave so early . __eou__ Thank you very much . I had a really good time . __eou__ Thanks for coming ! We should meet again sometime soon . __eou__ That would be great ! Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That ’ s assuming you don ’ t mind if I call you sometime . __eou__ Anytime . You can reach me 5558929 . __eou__ ok , got it . I ’ ll call you sometime next week . __eou__ Fine . __eou__ It ’ s time to go and I hope we can get together again soon . __eou__ I hope so , too . Bye ! Ben . __eou__
May , could you bring this note to Professor Li for me today ? __eou__ Sure , no problem . Asking for leave again ? You have been absent from class five times this semester . __eou__ I know . But attending Miss Li's class is just waste of time . No more than one third of her students will go to her class . __eou__ I agree that Miss Li doesn't teach so well . Most students either sleep or do other things in her class . __eou__ Yeah , my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me . Or I chat with my friends through text messages . __eou__ Fortunately her class is just an elective course , not as important as compulsory courses . __eou__ Right , so we must spare some time to attend selective courses . __eou__ But isn't it too impolite to be absent ? __eou__ What can I do ? I have things to do in Students ' Government . __eou__ Oh , I thought you just gave an excuse on this note . __eou__ Sometimes I will try various excuses . But this is my last time asking for leave . Or I will have a bad record . __eou__ Yeah , besides , your credit will be deducted . That is kind of serious . __eou__ I have been absented from many classes this semester just because of my work in the Students ' Government . __eou__ You can't write with one hand and draw with the other . __eou__ I am thinking about quitting my job in the student government . But before that , I must do my job . Bye . Don't forget about that note . __eou__ You can count on me . __eou__
Do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ? __eou__ How regular ? __eou__ An average ten hours or more a day according to a survey , the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that . __eou__ You are kidding me ? It is against the labor law . They should be aware of their rights . __eou__ But these people say nothing about that . They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days . __eou__ That ’ s not right , somebody should do something . __eou__
Can we have two tickets for the 7:30 showing of ' Beautiful Mind ' . __eou__ Sorry , we have sold out the tickets . __eou__ What's on tomorrow at that time ? __eou__ ' Beautiful Mind ' will be playing again . And there's also ' Titanic ' . __eou__ Terrific , that's a wonderful movie , I like it very much . Can I get tickets now for tomorrow ? __eou__ Yes , 20 yuan for each . __eou__ Two tickets , please . __eou__ OK . Here you are . __eou__
What would you like to be in the future ? __eou__ A teacher . __eou__ But if I were you , I would be a singer . You've got such a beautiful voice . __eou__ I wouldn't like to be a singer , but I'd like to become a music teacher to teach children to sing , That dream developed in my mind when I was a child . __eou__ Are you sure about that ? __eou__ I'm quite sure . I've always loved working with children . __eou__
Didn't Joe feel it a shame to live on his parents since he has graduated from college ? __eou__ He has no sense . __eou__ If I were him , I wouldn't brazen it out by asking my parents for money . __eou__ But Joe won't you . __eou__
My goodness ! She is thirty seconds faster than the world record in 5000 metres race . __eou__ Excuse me , what did you say ? __eou__ A Chinese girl has broken the world record in the Olympic Games . __eou__ That's incredible . I can't believe it . __eou__ You have to . It is sure . __eou__ How amazing ! __eou__
I like small towns . __eou__ But many roads are very narrow . __eou__ Not always , and there're also few cars ! __eou__ Yes , because of fewer people . __eou__
Veronica ! Veronica ! Veronica ! Are you OK ? __eou__ Steven ! What ’ s going on ! Who were those guys ? I didn ’ t know you have a gun ! What ’ s going on ! __eou__ I will come clean as soon as we get to safety , OK ? For now , you have to trust me , please ! I would never do anything to hurt you . __eou__ Steven , I ... __eou__ I haven ’ t been completely honest with you Veronica , I ’ m sorry . I ’ m not a fireman . I ’ m not even from the United States . I ’ m a spy for the Indian government . __eou__ What ? Why didn ’ t you tell me before ? What are you doing here ? __eou__ When I was a young boy , I used to play cricket my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad . It was a peaceful town , and my father was a renowned chemist . One day , he was approached by members of the CIA , claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where he taught bio-chemistry . I never saw him again . I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau . __eou__ What does that have to do with those men shooting at us ? Most importantly , why did you lie to me ! __eou__ I ’ m sorry , I wasn ’ t supposed to meet you . I wasn ’ t supposed to fall in love with you , but you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real . __eou__ I can ’ t believe this ! Why are all these things happening to me ! I can ’ t take it anymore ! Let me out of the car ! __eou__ Veronica , wait ! __eou__
Hey , May . How about getting together for a movie tonight ? __eou__ Sure . What's playing ? __eou__ Well , Let me check the newspaper . What about The Terminal ? __eou__ Wow , it stars Catherine Zeta-Jones , my favorite actress . __eou__ Well , birds of a feather flock together . I like her too . She was in a lot of dramas . __eou__ She is so beautiful and elegant . And she is famous for her fine acting . __eou__ What's more , she doesn't have scandals . And she likes to take part in the charitable activities . __eou__ Who is the director ? __eou__ Steven Spielberg . Another superstar . __eou__ Yes , a legend , also . I still remember , his movies , Jurassic Park and Schindler's List got him nine Oscar awards in 1994 . __eou__ Can you introduce the story of The Terminal briefly ? __eou__ It tells a romantic and humorous love story . __eou__ This is really exciting movie . Lets go to this one . __eou__
He's too young for the job . __eou__ Give him a chance . __eou__
Happy New Year ! __eou__ Thank you ! The same to you . __eou__ Have you got any plans ? __eou__ I've been invited over to a friend's . And you ? __eou__ My roommate's having a party . __eou__
What musical instrument do you play ? __eou__ I can play the piano a bit . __eou__ Then we can have one more program at our party ? __eou__ No , no . My playing isn't good enough for me to perform in public . __eou__
Just make yourself at home . __eou__ Thank you . You are cooking up a storm . __eou__ Wouldn't you like some more chicken ? __eou__ No , thank you . I'm afraid I can't take in anymore . __eou__
Oh you look awful ! What ’ s the matter ? __eou__ Oh ! I feel really under the weather . I ’ Ve got a sore throat and a bad cough . __eou__ Oh dear . Maybe you ’ Ve caught a cold . __eou__ Yes , I ’ Ve had lots of overtime to do recently and I haven ’ t slept much at all . __eou__ Well then , you should get some rest this weekend and don ’ t go out drinking . __eou__ Yes , I think you ’ re right ! __eou__
Hi , Fanny . __eou__ Hi , Andy . __eou__ Are you feeling OK ? You sound a little tired this morning . __eou__ I did not sleep much last night . I really feel bad . It was a crazy night . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I had a bad dream . I was walking alone in the graveyard , and suddenly all the ghosts jumped out of their graves . They began to chase me through the graveyard and shouted that they wanted my blood . __eou__ Oh , what a nightmare ! Then what happened ? __eou__ My mother woke me up . She had heard me crying out for help . __eou__ You have got a great mother . __eou__ I felt embarrased . After all , I am 18 years old . Mom gave me some chocolate cookies and a glass of milk . __eou__ That sounds good ! __eou__ Yeah , but i was afraid to fall back asleep . I am worrying about getting into the University of Michigan . __eou__ Me too . But I tell myself that if they don ’ t accept me , another school will . __eou__
Hey ! That food was terrific . I can't eat another bite . Are you sure you don't want another dish ? __eou__ No , I'm full . My stomach isn't growling at me any more . __eou__ I know what you mean . I'm so full that I can burst . Shall we go then ? __eou__ I'm all set . Thank you for the dinner , Jack . __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__
Hey , Maris , are you a part-timer ? __eou__ Part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ? __eou__ Oh , it ’ s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ? __eou__ Sure , I have a part-time job as a bartender . __eou__ Cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar ! __eou__ Yeah , but I ’ m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset . __eou__ That ’ s true . I ’ m wondering did you learn anything from the job ? __eou__ Of course . There ’ s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world . __eou__ You mean you got working experience , right ? __eou__ Not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life . __eou__ It must be very demanding . __eou__ Sometimes it is . But after working for a few weeks , it ’ s easy to figure out . __eou__ Really ? It sounds interesting . __eou__ Maybe you can come to the bar one day and I ’ ll show you around . __eou__ Great . I ’ m looking forward to it . __eou__
Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? __eou__ What ? Why do we have to do that ? __eou__ Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . __eou__ I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! __eou__ That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ’ s eight time zones east of Greenwich ! __eou__ That ’ s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ’ s like we went back in time ! __eou__
You wouldn't believe what happened to me today . __eou__ What ? __eou__ The teacher asked me to make a speech in English class and I wasn't prepared . He punished me by making me stand in front of the whole class . It was so embarrassing . __eou__
Does your girl friend like swimming ? __eou__ Yes , she does . She is good at backstroke and free style . __eou__ Then you can help her with the breaststroke and sidestroke . __eou__ But she wants to learn the butterfly stroke __eou__ Really ? Then just ask her to follow me . __eou__ I heard you are now practicing underwater swimming , aren't you ? __eou__ Yes . But I still have some difficulties it breathing . __eou__ Say , kid , keep on practicing , you're sure to be a first-class swimmer . __eou__ To tell you the truth , I have never thought of being a swimmer . I swim just for fun . __eou__ That's good . __eou__
He was once a poor man but now he is a man of means . __eou__ How did he make a fortune ? __eou__ He didn't make any effort . His aunt died and left him a fortune . __eou__
what do you think of studying abroad ? __eou__ I think it's a great idea . Studying abroad will offer you plenty of new opportunities . Are you planning on going abroad ? __eou__ yes , I hope so . I am studying for my BELTS right now . __eou__ which country do you want to go to ? __eou__ I'd like to study in the UK , but it's really expensive . __eou__ have you applied to any schools there ? __eou__ yes , I received a conditional offer from Oxford University a few days ago . __eou__ congratulations ! That's excellent news ? What do you have to do to get an unconditional offer ? __eou__ I have to get an BELTS score of 7.5 overall . Do you think I can do that ? __eou__ if you study hard , I don't see why you wouldn't . Have you received any other offers ? __eou__ I was also accepted into Yale University , and Sydney University . __eou__ if you're worried about money , the cost of living is lowest in America . However , if you go to Oxford University , you'll probably be able to get any job you want in the future . __eou__ I just can't decide where to go . It's not an easy decision to make . __eou__ if I were you , I'd apply for some scholarships and grants before you decide . Whatever you do , I know you'll succeed . __eou__
You have drank dozens of cups . You are bound to get a bay window . __eou__ Thank you , but I am in a terrible mood indeed . __eou__
Mr . Lin , what are you interested in ? __eou__ I enjoy camping . __eou__ Really ? I'm not much of an outdoor person . What do you like about it ? __eou__ I love the fresh air , the scenery the exercise , and the time to think . __eou__ Do you hike or fish on your trips ? __eou__ Yes , both . Last trip I fished a little and hiked five miles . __eou__ Did you catch anything ? __eou__ Yes , but I threw them back . __eou__ How about Joining our summer camp next week ? __eou__ Great ! I can't wait . __eou__
Hey , Jim . I didn ’ t know you biked to work . __eou__ Yeah , it helps keep me fit and helps the environment , too . __eou__ One less car on the road means less pollution . __eou__ Right . Since my work is near a park , it ’ s a really nice ride , too . __eou__ How far is it ? __eou__ Oh , about 10 miles . It takes me about an hour . __eou__ That doesn ’ t sound too bad . I wish I could do it , but I work in the city . So I take the train . __eou__ You ’ re doing your part for the environment by using public transportation , too . __eou__ True . Well , see you tomorrow . __eou__ See you . __eou__
Did you hear about Neil ? __eou__ No , what ? __eou__ I hear that he's quitting . __eou__ You're kidding ! __eou__ I'm afraid not ! Now this is just between you and me . __eou__
I wonder if I could possibly borrow two bikes from the shop tomorrow ? I ’ ll take actual care of them . I promise you . __eou__ Well . All right , Mark . Just this once . But you have to pick them up yourself . I ’ m a very busy man . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s all right . It ’ s very kind of you . Can I come around now ? __eou__ I ’ d rather you didn ’ t come immediately as I said I ’ m very busy at the moment . Come after lunch , Mark . __eou__
Yeah . You don't need to rub it in . __eou__ And then she made the deal with MicroPower . Vince wanted to sell for fifteen million ... __eou__ Fifteen ? And Zina pushed them up to seventy-five ? __eou__ That's right . Vince still stops by her office every day to thank her . __eou__ Anyway , I'm still happy I left . I'm working as a freelancer now . __eou__ You really should have stayed with us , Dave . __eou__
I feel I work harder when I am under pressure . __eou__ Me too . I get much more done when I am under the gun . __eou__
You spoken English is pretty good . Please tell me your experience in learning English . __eou__ Uh , I don't know what to say . What do you want to know ? __eou__ What's your method of learning ? __eou__ Let me think a minute . I think I always try to take every chance to practice . __eou__ What if there is no chance ? I mean what if you don't have a partner , what will you do ? __eou__ Well , I talk to myself . That is , I play one role first , then the other . __eou__ That's a good idea . You are really creative . __eou__
I am not convinced by your explanation . Could you explain it ? __eou__ Sorry , I really can't do that . There's little time left for us . __eou__ I can't accept your excuse . It's five o'clock . __eou__ Yeah . But I have an appointment with Ann . __eou__ Ok , sounds good . But I think it's your trick . __eou__
Hello , Tom ! __eou__ Hello , Steven ! __eou__ How are you doing ? __eou__ Not bad . What about you ? __eou__ I'm just a little tired . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I have a lot of work to do in the company recently . __eou__ How is your family ? __eou__ Pretty fine , thanks . __eou__ Where are you going now ? __eou__ I am going to buy a new air conditioner for my parents . Oh , it ’ s two o ’ clock . I must go now . __eou__ OK , see you next time . __eou__ See you . __eou__
Hi , John . What brings you to town ? __eou__ Hi , Mary . Lily wanted me to buy her some things for the party . __eou__ What do you think of the traffic today ? __eou__ It ’ s pretty bad . __eou__ Yeah . You can say that again . It ’ s noisy too . __eou__ I am glad I did not drive a car . __eou__
Which season do you like best ? __eou__ I like spring . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Oh , everything comes back to life in spring and the weather gets warmer . __eou__ I like spring , too.We can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air . __eou__
Bill , how can you hear so happy today ? __eou__ Aha . I've read of my roommate . I made a move today . __eou__ Really ? What was the matter ? __eou__ You knew Brain Locker ? __eou__ Brain Locker ? No , I don't think so . What does he look like ? __eou__ Well , he's thin and tall . He has brown hair , a holt nose , green eyes and wearing glasses . __eou__ Mm . I've seen him a couple of times , I think . __eou__
How are you doing today ? __eou__ Good . Thanks for asking . __eou__ What may I do for you ? __eou__ I need help with something . __eou__ What do you need help with ? __eou__ I am looking for a newspaper article . __eou__ Have you looked in the periodicals ? __eou__ I didn ’ t even think about that . __eou__ I can show you where they are . __eou__ That would be a lot of help . __eou__ Follow me , please . __eou__ Thank you so much . __eou__
What do you usually do in your work time ? __eou__ Some routine job . Files , documents , faxes and so on . __eou__ Are you usually busy ? __eou__ It depends . Sometimes I am very busy . __eou__ What depends ? __eou__ Oh , that means I can't make sure for my own . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__
Thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . Is that common ? __eou__ Well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows . __eou__ Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn't look like real rice to me . __eou__ It wasn't . It was birdseed . We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it . __eou__ Oh , I didn't think of that . Well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China . Plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions . __eou__ Wait until you see what happens next ! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . Let's go over and watch . __eou__ She ’ s got quite a crowd around her . Oh , look ! That little girl caught it ! __eou__ She ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece . I guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time . __eou__
You look run down , Brian . __eou__ I've been feeling under the weather recently . I caught a bad cold last week , and I still haven't got over it . __eou__ Well , you wanna take a sick leave ? All you need now is a good , long rest . __eou__ I guess so . Even though I seem to be over the worst of it . I don't want to give the bug to anyone in the office . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__
You seem to be in the seventh heaven . What's put you on ? __eou__ Sarah and I could see eye to eye with each other . __eou__ Did she give up her decision to marry Dick ? __eou__ No , I encourage her to go her own way , but she's now having a change of heart . __eou__
Excuse me . Can you tell me how to find some books on social science ? __eou__ Sure . You see all these little drawers here and all the way around the walls ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ These drawers contain cards describing every book in our library . Together they constitute the library's " card catalog " . You can see that each drawer runs from one part of the alphabet to another . Fox example , this drawer goes from SCA to SCM . __eou__ So if I'm looking for a look called A History of Western Society , I'd just look under ' A ' . __eou__ No . You'd look under ' W ' . The articles ' a ' and ' the ' don't count in our alphabetization , and cards are generally omitted for extremely common words and phrases such as ' history of ' , ' introduction to ' , ' story of ' and so forth . __eou__ What if I don't know the title of the book ? __eou__ Well , you can look under the author's name . __eou__ Could you give me an example ? __eou__ Suppose you want to find a book by your professor , William Smith . You'd look under SMITH and then WILLIAM . Since that's very common name , you may have to go through several ' William Smith ' until you come to the one who wrote book on the subject you are interested in . __eou__
Julia , are you free tonight ? __eou__ What's up ? __eou__ I want to invite you to go to the movies . __eou__ Are you asking me for a date ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I don ’ t like to go to the movies on a date . It's noisy there . __eou__ Where do you want to meet ? __eou__ Let's go to the coffee shop then . It's quiet there . __eou__ What time should we meet ? __eou__ How about seven ? __eou__ All right . __eou__
Hello , Catherine . Would you like to go out tomorrow ? __eou__ Tomorrow ? __eou__ Yeah , I was thinking we could get a bite to eat and catch a movie . __eou__ That sounds great . __eou__ Yes . We can do something else if you like . __eou__ OK . Dinner and a movie will be perfect . __eou__ Well . What time would you like me to pick you up ? __eou__ How about 7 o'clock ? __eou__ Good . I will see you then . __eou__ OK . Bye . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
Hey , there ’ s Leo . I wonder why he ’ s walking arm in arm with that young woman . __eou__ It ’ s as plain as the nose on your face . They ’ re dating each other . __eou__ You ’ re pulling my leg ! She must be thirty years younger than Leo . Talk about robbing the cradle ! __eou__ Well , you can bet this relationship ’ s going to be a flash in the pan . __eou__ It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn ’ t have a girlfriend last week . __eou__ I think you are absolutely right . Actually , my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . They got married a month later . __eou__
Do you think maybe it would be better to just talk to Vince ? Explain the situation ? __eou__ No way . I want the satisfaction of squishing this bug myself . Plus , what if it's Vince ? __eou__ I don't think so . Your admirer seems kind of sweet . Aren't you even a little curious about him ? __eou__ He's just a distraction , like a mosquito buzzing in my ear . I want no distractions . __eou__ A little distraction might do you some good , Zina . __eou__
You didn't ring me last night . You said you would . __eou__ I'm sorry to have made you disappointed . __eou__ That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . __eou__ Was I ? Sorry , I didn't mean to be . I do apologize . __eou__ And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? __eou__ Forgive me darling . I'm very tired . __eou__
Hi , how is it going ? __eou__ Pretty good , Sam . Only the awful weather , you know . __eou__ That ’ s right . I ’ Ve never really liked it since I got here . __eou__ Me either , but I ’ m dealing with it anyway . __eou__
Would you like to go skiing with me ? I heard the new ski area is great . They have safe tracks , especially for the beginners and provide free training . I think it suits you best . __eou__ Sounds not bad ! You know , the only thing I worried about is the safety .

not a single email until now ? it's already twelve o'clock . I can't believe it ! __eou__ can't bear it , right ? I've been there before . I'll feel comfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages , like there is something missing . __eou__ yeah , that's right . If no one sends me test messages , I'll go crazy . __eou__ actually , this is a kind of addiction called " infomania " or " information overload " . __eou__ addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way ! __eou__ yes , it is . Do you consider a frequent check of your income emails to be an integral part of your working day ? __eou__ absolutely . __eou__ do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time ? __eou__ yeah , it's a must .

Nice dress . How do I look ? Be honest . __eou__ Hmm ... you look too dressed up . How about this purple top and these jeans ? __eou__ Well , that top is a little too tight , and those jeans aren ’ t dressy enough . And I don ’ t feel comfortable with that .

How often do you use the internet ? __eou__ I use it almost every day , but I usually only use it to check my email . I don ’ t often surf the net . You use the internet a lot , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . I use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . It can be frustrating when the connection is poor . __eou__ So , you ’ re online eight hours a day . __eou__ Yes , I like the job though . Sometimes , I help other people in the office if they ’ re having trouble online . __eou__ How useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ? __eou__ I think it ’ s fairly useful , but there are two big problems . First , a lot of the information you find online is false . Second , when you buy something online , you don ’ t see it until you actually get it . __eou__ How do you solve the website problems when you ’ re buying something online ? __eou__ What I do is find the website of shops . Then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they ’ re seen that the products are genuine and suitable . __eou__
Today more and more families have personal computers . People have wider range of choice to communicate with the outside world . __eou__ Right . With the establishment of Internet and a lot of web companies , people are getting more and more dependent on the web . __eou__ One of the common uses of PC is that people can buy goods through it without going out to the physical stores . __eou__ Can you tell me how it is done ? __eou__ If a customer is interested in some certain goods , he can ask the web company to have the specimen of the goods shown on the color screen , and then the customer can place an order online to the sales company . And then the goods you want will be delivered to your home . The service is perfect and the delivery is free of charge . __eou__ I see . So great . __eou__

The city life has made us tired and out of energy , while the natural world can bring us quite new feelings . __eou__
My mother and my wife are always holding different ideas . __eou__ If you are really in love with your wife , you should be in support of her .

I don't have to worry about what I'm going to wear every day . __eou__ so are you enjoying your new job ? __eou__ it's much better than my old one . My new boss is great . __eou__ how do you like working in sales ? __eou__ I like the fact that I get to work with people . It makes the day go by much faster . __eou__ that's good . Have you met Jane yet ? She's the intern in the international travel department . __eou__ yeah , I've met her . She's a genius saleswoman ! __eou__ I know ! She could sell fridges to Eskimos ! __eou__ how do you know her ? __eou__ she's my cousin . __eou__ why didn't you tell me about that before ? __eou__ I don't know . I didn't think it was that interesting . __eou__ well , now that I know that , maybe we should all go out for dinner sometime . __eou__ that's a good idea . Let's discuss after work . __eou__
Isn ’ t this great ? I always wanted to own a farm , live out in the country , grow my own food ! __eou__ This is very beautiful . Though I have to confess , I don ’ t know the first thing about farming ! __eou__ That ’ s fine ! Don ’ t worry about it ! __eou__ What was that ? __eou__ Relax , it was just a goat ! __eou__ And that ? __eou__ It ’ s just the cows that are grazing over there . We can milk them later . __eou__ What was that ? __eou__ Honey , seriously , It ’ s just a sheep . Relax ! __eou__ Relax , that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable . __eou__ You know what ? I don ’ t think I can hack it here out in the countryside . I ’ m going back to the city ! __eou__

I watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . It was called unusual plants and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features . __eou__ Really ? Tell me about some of the plants they showed . __eou__ Well . There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them . __eou__ Is that type of plant found in this country ? __eou__ No , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because I ’ d like to see it in action . __eou__ So would i . what other unusual plants did they show ? __eou__ They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . Other insects cannot get it . Of course , when the insect molle __eou__ That ’ s very specialized . So , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . If one became extinct , the other would too . __eou__ That ’ s right . That ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species . __eou__ I see . The plants that fascinate me most are cacti . I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions . __eou__ According to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation . __eou__ That ’ s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves , to reduce water loss . __eou__
I got the job you recommended me for last week . __eou__ That's great ! Congratulations . __eou__ I really don't know how I can thank you enough . __eou__ Oh , it's my pleasure .

The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors . __eou__ It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it . __eou__ Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon . __eou__ That's true . __eou__
I can ’ t believe it ! __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? That was a great goal . __eou__ Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars ! __eou__ Looks like you ’ re going to lose out on this game then . __eou__ I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure . __eou__ What were the odds ? __eou__ 20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars ! __eou__ Too bad . __eou__

Ernie , I'm really excited about starting this band together . We're going to be the two coolest students on campus . __eou__ I know ! It's gonna be great .

You are in love with someone else . You are in love with my friend , Janet . You appreciate her very much . You think she is beautiful and fun to be with and you think I ’ m dumb and uninteresting . __eou__ Susan , just one last week I went out to have a lunch with her . There is nothing for you to be jealous about . I like your company much better than Janet ’ s . __eou__ I envy her and also I hate her at the same time . __eou__ Honey , you should know that I love you so deeply . __eou__ Oh , shut up , Roy . __eou__ But honey , I think you ’ re terrific . There is nothing ... __eou__ Oh , SHUT UP ! __eou__
what kinds of tv programmes do you enjoy watching ? __eou__ I like current affairs programmes and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ? __eou__ I like those kinds of programmes too . They ’ re very informative . I think that many people underrate the education value of tv . __eou__ I agree . People often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence . __eou__ yeah . And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational ! __eou__ right . You can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programmes . They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programmes . __eou__ in my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . I think it ’ s about six minutes per hour . __eou__ that ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? __eou__ no . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ? __eou__ not as far as I know . We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! That ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv , where you pay a fixed amount each mo __eou__ some people have satellite and cable tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their tv programmes . Besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programmes . __eou__ well , there ’ s a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes . Shall we ? __eou__
Bon voyage ! __eou__ Goodbye . __eou__
Can you believe me ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Please count on my love . __eou__ I will . __eou__ I'll be yours through endless time . __eou__ I see . And I'll always be devoted to you . __eou__ Thank you . I know I've nothing to offer you , but I'll never give you reason to cry . __eou__ I'll never hurt you ; I'll never lie . __eou__ My love will grow , like a river to flow . __eou__ It can't be dry , and can't die . __eou__ I don't know whether we are in a dream . __eou__ Aha , Aha ... __eou__
Hi , Sara , what are you reading ? __eou__ Hi , John , I am trying to find a carpenter . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Well , I want to build a deck in my back yard . __eou__ What for ? __eou__ So I can have a special place to hang out with friends , and also do some barbecuing on weekends . __eou__ That sounds cool . Do you mind if I recommend myself for the job ? __eou__ You ? Do you have a carpenter's license ? __eou__ Yes , of course . But I only freelance on weekends with my uncle . __eou__ Wow ! That's cool . So , let me give you some details about the deck I want . __eou__ Please go ahead , I am listening . __eou__ I'd like my deck to be at the same level as the back door . __eou__ Is your back door higher than the ground level ? __eou__ Yes , the back door is about four or five steps higher than the ground . __eou__ Okay , then you need a deck with a guardrail . __eou__ I don't like things to be fancy . __eou__ Don't worry . I will build your deck with a simple but classic look . __eou__ Hmm , that's good . Can you use cedar or redwood to build it ? __eou__ Cedar is a good choice . __eou__ Well , let's take the measurements right now . __eou__
Are you tired ? __eou__ Not really . __eou__
It's late.It ' s high time I left.Thank you for a most wonderful evening . __eou__ Don't mention it . __eou__ Good night then ! __eou__ Good night ! __eou__

The results of the poll show Bill Clinton's approval rating has gone up in his second term . Do you find that interesting ? __eou__ Well , I think Clinton deserves high marks for doing his job generally , but he may get low marks for his honesty and personal image . __eou__ That is exactly what the poll shows . Although the stating of Clinton as a person has gone down in the last two years of his term , his approval rating is as high as 66 percent . __eou__ I don't find this surprising . The poll data sound quite right . He is a good president . __eou__ But the poll says only 15 percent say he will be remembered as an outstanding president . __eou__
What courses are you taking ? __eou__ Chinese , maths , English , chemistry , physics , biology and so on . __eou__ What do you think about the teachers ? __eou__ To be honest , I like most of them , except for my Chinese teacher . She is quite young , but her class is too boring ! __eou__ That's too bad . Do you have any foreign teachers ? __eou__ Yes , my oral English teacher is an American . He is from a small town in California . __eou__ What is he like ? __eou__ He is great . He always tells us not to study for exams , and to pay more attention to communication rather than just memorizing . __eou__ Are you able to follow him ? __eou__ Not everything , but nearly . He speaks very clearly . __eou__ Oh , that's good ! He sounds like a good teacher . __eou__ Absolutely ! If you come to our class , I am sure you will like him . __eou__
How do I apply to an American university ? __eou__ You should go to the library to find some information about American universities , and write to the Admission Office . Then the Admission Office will send you application forms and other related materials . From experience , many applicants write to several universities instead of just one . __eou__ I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply . __eou__ That is true . I ’ ll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It ’ s usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars . __eou__ What's to come next ? __eou__ If they agree to enroll you , they will send you a TAP - 66 Form . With TAP - 66 , you can apply for a passport from our government , and then apply for a visa from the US . Embassy in Beijing . __eou__ How long will it take to go over all the procedures ? __eou__ From 3 to 6 months if everything goes well . __eou__ Thank you . I appreciate your help . __eou__ You are welcome . Please feel free to ask if you have any more questions . __eou__

What impressed you most ? __eou__ Well , the cultural differences impressed me most . __eou__ You mean we Chinese think differently from the Americans ? __eou__ That's right , quite different . One day one of my American friend looked pale , so I asked him whether he was sick or not . But he was reluctant to answer my question . __eou__ That's weird . __eou__ And what's more , when he told me he had caught a cold for several days , I suggested him to go to the hospital as soon as possible . __eou__ You really cared about your friend . __eou__ Sure I am . But he responded by saying'what do you mean ? ' . __eou__ I'm confused . Why did he say that ? __eou__ I felt the same at first . Later he told me that I'd better not give him any suggestions when he was sick . Offering unsolicited help or advice is like showing sympathy to the weak or the poor . But back in China , helping others is always regarded being kind . __eou__ Absolutely . Now I understand why he responded that way . __eou__
He has so many friends supporting him . __eou__ And he himself is very diligent . Considering all these , I think he has the ball at his feet . __eou__ But he has to stick to it and to it long enough . __eou__
It's time to leave the office for the night . Firstly I log off my computer , then I set the electronic security system . __eou__ That's pretty advanced . __eou__ Now I'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement . __eou__ Is that where you park ? __eou__ Yes , the car park is under constant video surveillance , so my car is quite safe . Please get in . __eou__ Thank you . Where is your key ? __eou__ There's no need , I have keyless entry , and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car . Now , we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home . __eou__ That's amazing , it even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment . __eou__ Using GPS I can rely on this to direct me home . Now I just need to find my E-Card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out . __eou__ Pretty soon cars will be driving themselves . __eou__ Maybe , but in the meantime why not help me find the remote control for my garage door ? __eou__ Here it is , and here we are . __eou__ When I turn off my home alarm , the house will automatically tum on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level . __eou__ I have to get home , but I don't need all of this fancy technology , I think I'll just walk . __eou__
Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ? __eou__ Yeah , I ’ m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains . __eou__ Oh , do you go hiking often ? __eou__ I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature . __eou__ It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ? __eou__ Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? __eou__ Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike . __eou__ Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city . __eou__ Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest . __eou__ Well , bring him along too . We ’ ll have a great time this weekend . __eou__ Thanks , I ’ ll ask him . __eou__
Miss Wang , would you mind my asking you a personal question ? __eou__ No , not at all . Go ahead . __eou__ Are you married ? __eou__ Yes . Is that so important ? __eou__ Frankly yes . We like to employ married people . By the way , do you have any children ? __eou__ Yes , I have a three-year-old son . __eou__
Hello . __eou__ Mark , this is Lucy . __eou__ What's up ? __eou__ I have a friend . He is my best friend and he wants to learn English . He would pay about 100 yuan per hour . Are you interested ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ So I take it you are not interested . __eou__ No , Lucy . Don't get me wrong . I mean school will be open on Sept . 2nd , and I will have a very tight schedule by then . __eou__ Don't worry . My friend says he can always arrange his schedule around your schedule . __eou__ That will be fine . When can I see him ? __eou__ Let's do it this way . I'll take him to your place this Saturday . Then you two can make a schedule . __eou__ Make sure you come here before noon . I will be picking up my friend at the airport in the afternoon . __eou__ How are you going to get there ? __eou__ By bus , of course . __eou__ I am sure my friend can give you a ride . __eou__ Great . By the way , what does your friend do ? __eou__ He is a lawyer . __eou__ Ok , see you then . __eou__ See you . __eou__
He ’ s got laid off again . I do feel sorry for him . __eou__ Do you really ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I just think he deserves it . __eou__
Could you tell me something about the Mid-Autumn Festival ? I find it also very interesting . __eou__ OK . It falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month . It is said that there is a beautiful goddess Chang'E on the moon who had eaten some sort of elixir and had to depart her husband . She is always expecting to see her husband again . So , later we have the traditional idea that when there is the full moon , it is time for the family members to come together . __eou__ So , I understand why people eat moon cakes on that day . __eou__ You are right . In China , ' round ' is an auspicious word . The moon cakes are in round shape . __eou__ Is it official ? __eou__ It was not in the past . But from 2008 , we can enjoy a three-day holiday for this festival . __eou__
Good morning , Miss . __eou__ Morning . Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I'd like to know how to use the library . You know , I'm a new student here . __eou__ All you need is your student identification card to check out books . __eou__ Yes.Here ' s my identification . __eou__ That's all you need . __eou__ Thank you very much . By the way , how many books am I allowed to check out ? __eou__ You can check out two books at a time . But you can't check out newspapers , magazines and periodicals ; they have to be read within library . __eou__ How long can I keep the books ? __eou__ For two weeks . After that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer . __eou__ I want a book on physics . Could you show me where I can find it ? __eou__ Yes , over there to your left . __eou__
I think this one will do . __eou__ I'm sorry . I don't think so . __eou__ Why ? What's wrong with it ? __eou__ It's much too hard for his age . __eou__
Have you heard that we will have reorganization ? __eou__ No , really ? __eou__ Yes , flexible , aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department . __eou__ Who will be there ? __eou__ James is going to be packed off there . __eou__ That is good . He can leave you alone this time . __eou__
Mrs . Smith , you are always worried about your children . __eou__ They are my own flesh and blood . It ’ s hard for me to see them suffering . __eou__ That ’ s human nature . __eou__
Happy birthday , Lillian . Here's a little present I bought for you . __eou__ Thank you , Paul . __eou__
Hi Isabel ! You wanted to see me ? __eou__ Yes Anthony , come on in . Have a seat . __eou__ Is everything okay ? You seem a bit preoccupied . __eou__ Well , Anthony , this is not going to be an easy conversation.The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment . __eou__ Okay ... __eou__ I don ’ t want to beat around the bush so I ’ m just gonna come out with it . We are going to have to let you go . __eou__ What ? Why ? I mean ... just like that ? I ’ m fired ? __eou__ I ’ m sorry but , to be honest , you are a terrible employee ! __eou__ What ! I resent that ! __eou__ Anthony , you were caught making international calls from the office phone , you called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol ! __eou__
Have you heard about Anlesen David ? __eou__ No , have they have another fight ? __eou__ No , they got engaged . __eou__ You must be joking . Those two ? __eou__ Well , my dear . I didn't believe either . But got it straight form the horse's mouth . David called me this morning . __eou__ So when did all this happen ? __eou__ Last weekend , while they were on the Sik trip . __eou__ Well , I believe it now , and when are they are getting married ? __eou__ Next June . __eou__ I can hardly believe it . __eou__
How about going to dance this evening , Jane ? You will find that the night life of this city is very interesting ! __eou__ Good idea . There is a good nightclub nearby , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , the dance hall is nice with various styles of music . __eou__ ( In the club ) Look at those people in the dance floor , they are so crazy . __eou__ That's rock and roll with fast tempo . __eou__ I like the slow dance . I am good at rumba and waltz . __eou__ Take it easy . The time for slow dance is the middle part of the party . __eou__ Let's find a quiet seat and sit down for beverage . __eou__ OK , follow me . __eou__ Listen , it is waltz . I like the elegant step of the old styles . __eou__ May I ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ ( When they are dancing ) You dance gracefully ! __eou__
Tom , you promised to cut the lung . You won't forget , will you ? __eou__ No , I assure you . __eou__ And you'll repair the television , won't you ? __eou__ Ok . __eou__ Do you promise ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ And Tom , you will help Johnny with his homework , won't you ? __eou__ I'll see . I will if I can but I won't promise . __eou__ But you'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? __eou__ Yes . But only if you ask me nicely . __eou__ Tom , darling . You'll try not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? Please ! __eou__ Ok . I'll keep my promise . __eou__
How did Jim get the money ? __eou__ He borrowed it from Nick . __eou__ He must be mad ! Nick is a loan shark . __eou__ He was too desperate to find some other way . __eou__
Too much , Harry . Don't blame her anymore . __eou__ But it was her that makes us so embarrassed . __eou__ I know . But there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ? __eou__ I don't care . __eou__
My goodness ! You ’ re kidding ! __eou__ No . I ’ m serious . I ’ m going to quit my job . __eou__ That ’ s amazing ! You got a good pay here , didn ’ t you ? __eou__ It ’ s true . But I can ’ t show my abilities . __eou__ Come on ! Don ’ t be silly ! __eou__ Your present job is something better . Why do you change ? __eou__ Well . How do you know ? __eou__
But Sue is indeed beaut . Men can hardly resist such a knock-out . __eou__ Birds of feather flock together . You must be one of these men . __eou__ I know little of her . I only think she ’ s pretty and intelligent . Of course , she ’ s diligent , too . __eou__ That ’ s enough for you to worship the ground she treats on . __eou__
I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots . __eou__ It was me . I am so sorry . __eou__ What did you think you were doing ? __eou__ I had to move it , so that I can get my bike through . __eou__ How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong . __eou__ I am awfully sorry . I didn't think you would mind so much . __eou__ Never do that again . __eou__ I promise . __eou__
She is so beautiful , isn't she ? __eou__ Who ? __eou__ Julia Roberts . __eou__ Yeah , she is so charming . I like her , too . __eou__ It's said that her new movie is going to come out . __eou__ What's the movie about ? __eou__ I'm not sure . __eou__ Isn't it silly to see a movie that you know nothing about ? __eou__ I already told you , because Julia Roberts is in it . I like her because she is not only a great actor but also is very generous to give a lot to many kinds of charities . __eou__ Yeah , she is great . I also admire her for her concern about society . __eou__
I hope the teacher decides to curve our test grades . __eou__ I wouldn't count on it . __eou__ She did last time . __eou__ Yes , but I'll bet she won't again . __eou__
Could you tell me how to use the library ? __eou__ Sure . All you need is your student ID card or admission card to check out books and read journals or magazines in the library . __eou__ How many books am I allowed to check out at a time ? __eou__ Two books at a time . Except magazines or journals , they have to be read within library . __eou__ How long can I keep the books ? __eou__ For one month . If you can ’ t return the books in time , you'll be fined . But if you renew them , you can keep them longer . __eou__ I see . Now I want to check out two books on spoken English . Can you show me where I can find them ? __eou__ Yes , just over there to your right . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
How did you do that ? __eou__ It was a piece of cake . __eou__
That new Sony camcorder you've got is just beautiful . __eou__ Yeah.It is the very latest in digital video cameras . __eou__ I can see digital video products are quickly going mainstream with their plunging price . __eou__ Getting cheaper is not the only reason for their popularity.They come with a lot of inviting functions . __eou__ Such as ? __eou__ They offer clearer and sharper images . Many of them also have up to 20x optical zoom lenses , a photo mode and fast-action mode . __eou__ They are very compact and are designed to be used with one hand . __eou__ Right ! Anyway , the basic difference between a digital camcorder and its traditional counterpart is that it speaks digital . __eou__ What does this mean ? __eou__ This means digital camcorders can be connected with the digital equipments you have at home , like your digital TV or your computer . __eou__ I can transfer my home video clips from my camcorder to my computer for editing . __eou__ Sure ! And without any conversion process or loss of quality ! You quickly find , cut , and record video segments and create slide shows . Some camcorders even offer editing software for adding titles and special effects . __eou__ What special effects ? __eou__ Like creating a sepia tone look and some special effects such as fades and dissolves . __eou__ That's great ! __eou__ With the development of the broad band Internet , you can easily upload your video files to websites or e-mail them to relatives or business partners . __eou__ So everybody's getting video mail . __eou__
Hi , David ! What are you doing ? __eou__ Oh , just looking at these club notices . I'm thinking of joining one . Hey-why don't we join a club together ? How about the Tennis Club ? __eou__ Actually , I'm not good at tennis at all ... __eou__ Neither am I . It's just that the best-looking girls are in that club . __eou__ Oh , come on . That's no reason to do something you're not interested in . __eou__ Well ... What are you interested in ? __eou__ How about the Classical Music Club ? __eou__ Joanna , give me a break . __eou__ Hey-how about the Cinema Club ? __eou__ Sounds OK to me . I like movies . Hey , Joanna , look - there are a lot of decent-looking guys here . And the club jackets - they're really hot ! I think we made the right choice ! __eou__
Either we'll be millionaires , or we won't ... won't have a dime . __eou__ And it's all coming down to the next three weeks . __eou__ The only person who seems confident the software will be done on time is Zina . __eou__ Yeah , she is some kind of Superwoman , isn't she ? __eou__ Failure just isn't an option for her . I'm glad she's on our team . __eou__
So , Monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ? __eou__ Actually , I had a perfect plan for this afternoon , but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . I woke up this morning and found it was sunny . So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . We were going to look for a new purse . Now it turned out to be like this . Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore . __eou__ That ’ s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ’ t people do something to stop it ? __eou__ It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course , it will not work overnight . So , have you come out with a new plan for today ? __eou__ My new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ I would like to return this book . __eou__ May I do anything else for you ? __eou__ I would also like to check out this magazine . __eou__ I can ’ t let you do that . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ Our policy doesn ’ t allow anyone to check out the magazines . __eou__ What things am I allowed to check out ? __eou__ You are only allowed to check out books or videos . __eou__ I really need to check out this magazine . __eou__ I ’ m sorry , but that ’ s our policy . __eou__ That ’ s stupid . __eou__
I've heard that Tom is going to move . __eou__ What ? Are you sure about that ? __eou__ Yeah , he is going to move next month . __eou__ Where is he going ? __eou__ He is going to Canada and to live with his son . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ Why did you say that ? It's a good thing for him to live with his son . __eou__ I know that . But it's pity for us to lose such a good neighbour . You know I always appreciate Tom's company . __eou__ Me too . But anyway we hope he lives happily in the future . __eou__
Have a nice Thanksgiving ! __eou__ The same to you ! __eou__ Are you going anywhere ? __eou__ I thought about going to my sister's . How about you ? __eou__ Oh , I'll probably just stay at home . __eou__
Have you noticed the Mexican restaurant on the other side of this street ? __eou__ You mean the one with the yellow bricks ? But last time I saw it , it wasn ’ t really in business yet . I saw some people inside furnishing the rooms . Is it open now ? __eou__ Yes , someone give me a pamphlet introducing the restaurant and its business hours when I passed by this morning . So , let ’ s have a try . My treat . __eou__ Great , I like the idea of trying some new food . __eou__ Good for you . Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world . __eou__ Also some traditional Chinese food , like noodles and dumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality . I heard this year , the government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hi-gene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control . For sure all the customers will benefit from this . __eou__
Steve . Is that you ? __eou__ Yeah . What's going on ? __eou__ Not much . What a surprise to see you here . __eou__ Yeah . It's been a couple of months since I saw you . __eou__ What have you been up to ? __eou__ I just started working out . __eou__ Really ? Where do you work out at ? __eou__ I joined the Samsung Health Club last month . __eou__ What do you mostly do during your workout ? __eou__ I concentrate mostly on my legs , chest , arms and stomach . __eou__ I should start exercising more . __eou__ It's hard work while exercising , but it is a great feeling when I get done . __eou__ I have a running machine at home . I used to use it , but I already got sick of it . __eou__ Exercising at home is hard . The environment is not suited for exercising . __eou__ If I want to exercise , I will need to join a gym . __eou__ I have a couple of guest passes . You want to check out my health club ? __eou__ That's a good idea . Let's go over the weekend . __eou__ Great . I'll call you Saturday morning . __eou__ Aright . I'll talk to you later . __eou__ Ok . Bye . __eou__
Anything interesting in this city ? __eou__ We have a beautiful natural park . __eou__ It's worth the time . __eou__ Come on.Let ' s walk there . __eou__
Is there anything wrong ? __eou__ I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager . __eou__ I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything . __eou__ You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision . __eou__ But I just want to give her some tips . __eou__ Oh , she can make her own decisions . __eou__
Merry Christmas , Lily . __eou__ The same to you , Joey . __eou__ This is your first Christmas in the US . Here is the gift for you . __eou__ It's very thoughtful of you . Wow , it is so beautiful . Could you tell me how American people celebrate Christmas ? __eou__ Ok . People decorate their houses , place a Christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a Christmas carol together . __eou__
The teacher should give us more time to complete this assignment . __eou__ You're right . Let's ask her to give us one more week . __eou__
Good evening . I've come to see Miss Morrison __eou__ Oh ! Good evening . I'm sorry , but she is not in . She's gone out to the theatre __eou__ Oh ! I've just come back from Canada and I've brought a parcel from her parents __eou__ Please come in __eou__ But you're busy , aren't you ? __eou__ I was preparing my supper but I've finished now . __eou__ I can leave the parcel with you , can't I ? __eou__ Oh ! yes __eou__
Brad , wait ! __eou__ What ? __eou__ How come you have a locker but I don't ? __eou__ Mr . Rogers probably forgot to assign a locker to you . __eou__ I had to carry my backpack with me all day . __eou__ Remind him to give you a locker tomorrow . __eou__ Does it have a lock ? __eou__ No . You have to buy your own . You'll have to go to a hardware store to pick one up . __eou__
You didn't tell me she was married ! __eou__ I tried . You were preoccupied . __eou__ I got carried away . I made such a fool of myself . They were both laughing at me ! __eou__ You got drunk , and you were hilarious . Lighten up . __eou__ That guy was definitely a Don . __eou__ So now you can say you had a mafia experience . Ha-ha . __eou__ Yeah . If I leave Little Italy alive ... __eou__ Are you kidding ? Don had fun scaring you . He'd probably buy you dinner if we go back . __eou__
Who is this on the water buffalo ? __eou__ That's my grand-father . He was a farmer . When he was young , he had to take the water buffalo to graze in the field . __eou__ Oh yes , that was the best job in most farm families . That's where many of them learned to play the flute . __eou__ My grandfather did that too . He used the time to study instead . __eou__ That's interesting . Go on ! __eou__ My grand grandfather was a merchant who ran a small business . He couldn't afford to send my grand father to school . __eou__ So he became a self-taught man ? __eou__ Right . Later he was a soldier and a fireman in the village . When he was middle aged , he became a great man , quite famous . __eou__ In what field ? __eou__ As a leader of police officers in charge of the whole country . __eou__ Is he still in that that type of work . __eou__ No . He retired from that . He is a senator now . __eou__ Would you want to be a senator ? __eou__ Well , maybe when I get old . But first I'll be a lawyer . __eou__
I am not certain , but I think I might ask to be considered for the new job . __eou__ Why are you considering trying for it ? __eou__ I think that I might like it , but I am still thinking about it . __eou__ What is it about this job that appeals to you ? __eou__ I think that I would enjoy the position but there isn't a lot of creativity involved . __eou__ Yes , you could be right . There is a lot to consider . __eou__ I am also wondering about the pay . __eou__ Would a slight decrease in pay be worth it for a new opportunity for growth ? __eou__ I am thinking that might be the case . __eou__ I think you should give it a shot . What do you have to lose ? You can always change your mind . __eou__
I was just thinking to call you , then the phone rang and it was you calling me . __eou__ Great minds think alike . __eou__
Hello , Kevin . I hate to do this , but I have to cancel our appointment . __eou__ Oh , no ! Why ? I was looking forward to seeing you at my new place . __eou__ Yeah , I really wanted to come , too . But something unexpected in shanghai have come up . I have to fly out for a few days , but I'll be back soon . __eou__ No problem.Call me when you get back . __eou__ I should have some free time next week . Say , next Wednesday evening ? __eou__ That's good for me , but do you think you'll be back by then ? I'd really like to see you . __eou__ Yeah , I'm expecting to come back on Tuesday . __eou__ Great ! That's settled then . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Look at this , A Brief Introduction of Hollywood . __eou__ Hackneyed theme ! __eou__ What ? How much do you know Hollywood ? __eou__ Nearly everything . __eou__ You are full of boasts . I can examine you by question and answer . What is Hollywood ? Where is it ? What is the function of it ? __eou__ Too easy questions . Listen carefully . Hollywood is the movie capital of the world.It is located in southern California . Many films have been made there , and the kinds have changed often . __eou__ Not bad . What kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930 ' s __eou__ Gangster movies . Movie-goers at that time could get a look at the people involved in crime and their violent activities by watching it . __eou__ Mm . What came after that ? __eou__ After all that violence , people needed to laugh , so from the mid-to-late l940 ' s , many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made . Then came musicals . __eou__ Pretty good . Please continue . __eou__ Right . By the mid - 50 ' s , this light-hearted genre was competing with films about more serious subjects . There was one kind that could be found throughout all of these years , and that was the , mm , the . . . __eou__ The western films about America's cowboys , Indians and early settlers . __eou__ Come on . __eou__ Since the early 1960 ' s , there are horror movies about people who encounter frightening , unnatural situations , and serious films such as documentarist about events that actually happened , and science fiction movies about possible friture and future worlds . Some people have also enjoyed watching psycho-dramas about the everyday problems that people have . __eou__ Any more ? __eou__ Of course , no list of film would be complete without animated movies . These are especially popular among children . __eou__
Hi , Bob . Can I have the book back I lent to you last month ? __eou__ Oh ! I forgot all about it . Of course you can have it back , John . I'm sorry about the delay . __eou__ Well , it doesn't matter . I almost forgot it too if it is not for Peter who asked me about it this coming . __eou__
Excuse me . May I use the phone first ? __eou__ Are you in a hurry ? __eou__ You bet . I was supposed to call my mother an hour ago . __eou__ In that case , here , you go first . __eou__
Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run.It was nice talking to you , karren . __eou__ Thanks , Tim.Nice meeting you , too . __eou__ I guess we'll see just around . __eou__ Ye , I hope so.well.Take it easy . __eou__ You too . __eou__
How good are you at sports , Bill ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? I ’ m terrible ! But I love to watch sports . I go to football or baseball games a lot . And I read sports magazines every week . __eou__ Wow ! __eou__ Do you like sports , Janice ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I like to exercise . But I don ’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines . I don ’ t have much time to do those things . __eou__ Oh , I see . You know , we spend time doing different sports . How much time do you spend exercising ? __eou__ Well , I guess I exercise about two hours a day . I do aerobics three times a week , and the other days I play badminton 1 with my husband . I always feel good afterward . __eou__ That ’ s great ! I ’ Ve heard people say that before . __eou__ Well , why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? It ’ s difficult , but very rewarding . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m too lazy to play sports , and I ’ m not good at anything either . It hardly excites me . __eou__
Alice , your father is amazing . He ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house . __eou__ I know . He doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself ! __eou__ That sounds like my Grandmother . She was always stubbornly independent . __eou__ It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own . __eou__ They see their independence as a kind of character strength . __eou__ Sometimes they are too independent . __eou__
This little wooden stick is called a tee . __eou__ What do you do with it ? __eou__ For the first drive , put the golf ball on the tee , and push the tee into the ground . __eou__ Okay . __eou__ Pick up a wood and hold it like this , interlocking your fingers . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Position yourself , swinging the club , watch the ball and hit it as hard as you can . __eou__ Hey ! __eou__ Not too bad . The goal is to get the ball into the hole with as few hits as possible . __eou__ Got it . __eou__
Excuse me . Is anyone sitting here ? __eou__ No , nobody . __eou__ You don ’ t mind if I smoke , do you ? __eou__ Well , to be frank , yes , I do . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry . But this isn ’ t a no-smoker , is it ? I mean would you mind if I smoke here ? __eou__ Actually it is . Perhaps you haven ’ t noticed the sign . __eou__ Sign ? What ’ s sign ? __eou__ There , on the window . __eou__ Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t notice it . Sorry . __eou__ That ’ s all right . __eou__
Are the ceremony and reception held in the same place ? __eou__ No , not usually . Most people are married in a church , and then the wedding party and guests go to another place for the reception . Sometimes , however , they hold the reception in a big room in the church . __eou__ Where do they go ? __eou__ Either they go to a public place such as a hotel , a restaurant , or a club , or to the home of the brid __eou__ They go to the home of the bride ? __eou__ Why do you ask ? __eou__ The Chinese custom is to go to the groom's home-just the opposite . __eou__ Oh ! In our country the bride's family is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement , costs , etc . So the reception is held at her home . __eou__ That's very expensive for the family of the bride . __eou__ Many American furthers joke that they would rather hold the ladder for their daughter to climb down and elope than pay for a wedding . __eou__ Tell me something about the bridal bouquet . Isn't it the custom to throw it ? __eou__ Yes . When the bride and groom are ready to leave on their honeymoon all the single girls gather in one place . The bride stands with her back to them and throws her bouquet over her shoulder and they each try to catch it . The one who does will be the next one married . __eou__ Maybe I'll be the one . __eou__
Guess what I just heard ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ The boss is planning to sell the company . __eou__ You must be joking ! __eou__
And the cover is great ! The colors are brilliant ! __eou__ Give me a break . You don't care about the colors . You just like the hot babe on the cover . __eou__ OK , you got me . So , do you have a subscription ? __eou__ Of course . I'm currently the subscriber of 10 different fashion magazines . __eou__ So what do you do with all the out-dated issues ? __eou__ I guess I'm lending them to you ... __eou__
I've moved . __eou__ Where to ? __eou__
We're going out to dinner and then to the movies . __eou__ Hold on ! I can't afford to pay for both . __eou__ Don't worry . I've got money . It's my treat . __eou__ Gee , that's really nice of you . __eou__
Hi , Kenji . __eou__ Hi , Debbie . Have a seat . How's it going ? __eou__ I'm OK . How are you doing ? __eou__ Pretty good . Listen ... have you heard about the new Thai restaurant over on University Avenue ? __eou__ Do you mean The Bangkok ? __eou__ That's the one . A bunch of us are going there for dinner tomorrow night.How about coming with us ? __eou__ Sure , I'd love to . __eou__ Great . I'll call and make reservations . __eou__ Any time after 6 o'clock is good for me.Oh ! I'm late ! I have a class . __eou__ All right . I'll call you tonight and tell you the time . __eou__ Great . Talk to you then . __eou__
Mr . Lee , I was wondering if you and your wife had plans for next Friday night ? __eou__ Yes , I think we might be free . What did you have in mind ? __eou__ I've mailed a formal written invitation to your home inviting you to a dinner party at my home . __eou__ That sounds great . Is it casual ? __eou__ Actually , we thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the holidays . __eou__ That sounds good . It will give my wife a chance to dress up . __eou__ Yes , we've invited four other couples , so it should be a good mix of people . __eou__ That sounds wonderful . Will there be anyone there that I know ? __eou__ Oh yes , everyone we are inviting is from our company . __eou__ Great ! I'll look forward to it . We'll make sure and check the mail for our invitation . __eou__
Do you know who that tall man is ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . But he must be a big shot . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because everyone is trying to butter him up . __eou__
You are blue in the face , arn't you ? __eou__ The cat has eaten my fish , I'll kill it . __eou__ But supposing your son killed like the fish , what do you think then ? __eou__ I'll beat him . __eou__ So beat the cat , but don't kill it . __eou__
Did you go to see Michael last night ? __eou__ Yes , He had just bought a new motorcycle . __eou__ Did he let you ride it ? __eou__ Yes , I tried it and I quite liked it . __eou__ Weren ’ t you frightened ? __eou__ Sure . But I still liked it . __eou__ Would you like to buy a motorcycle yourself ? __eou__ No . Although motorcycle is nice , I ’ d like to buy a bicycle . __eou__ But why ? Since you like it so much . __eou__ Because bicycles are safer . __eou__
I passed history test . __eou__ Really ? That ’ s marvelous ! __eou__ And then you ’ re old man won ’ t be beaten this time . __eou__ I ’ Ve made up my mind not to be beaten again . __eou__
Mr.Ben , What do you think of the book ? __eou__ It's an excellent one . I like it very much . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ It includes a lot of useful words and phrases . __eou__ I agree with you . __eou__
How do I buy my textbooks ? __eou__ Do you have your book list for your class ? __eou__ Yes , I have my list . __eou__ Fine . Once you have it , you can go to the bookstore . Do you know where that is ? __eou__ Yes , I know where the bookstore is . __eou__ OK , so once you pass the gym , it's the first door on your left . Do you know you can also sell your used textbooks there ? __eou__ No , I didn't know I could do that . __eou__ You just take them with you and trade them with the used textbook man just outside the door . Do you think you will be going there today ? __eou__ Yes , I am going today . __eou__ Well , if you decide to go , I could meet you over there at 1 __eou__ Yes , thank you . That would be great . __eou__ Well , then , I'll talk to you later . Have a good day ! __eou__
Is there anything wrong with your food this evening , Miss ? __eou__ Sorry to trouble you . But I don't think this fish is fresh . It actually tastes a bit off . __eou__ Sorry , Miss . I'll place it immediately , can I get you another drink , or you wait ? __eou__ No , please don't do that . I'd just like to return it . __eou__ I'm sorry , Miss , but I'm afraid we can't do that . You'll order something else instead . I'd love to suggest the steak , it's the special today , and quite tasty . __eou__ Ok , then please bring me the steak mediun-rare , thank you . __eou__ Ok , Miss . I hope you enjoy the rest of your dinner . __eou__
Bill . Bill ! You gotta help me ! __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? Slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack . __eou__ Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven ’ t bought my mom anything ! I ’ m such a bad son ! __eou__ Take it easy ! Let ’ s go to the mall , window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like . __eou__ That ’ s just it ! I don ’ t know what to get her ! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small ! I suck at getting presents for people . __eou__ That ’ s where you ’ re making a big mistake ! You can ’ t just guess peoples ’ likes or sizes ! Especially with clothes or jewelry . On top of that , I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her . At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like ! __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re right . When it comes down to it , I can be pretty tacky . __eou__ Yeah , tell me about it . I know ! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish , right ? Why don ’ t you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod . __eou__ Now that ’ s a great idea ! __eou__
Do you do morning exercises ? __eou__ Yes . I do one set of shadow-boxing every morning after I get up . __eou__ Shadow-boxing ? How interesting ! Do you think it really helpful for your health ? __eou__ Definitely . It not only keeps me fit but also helps me concentrate on my soul . __eou__
He loves that blonde girl . __eou__ Yes , he once gave her seven roses . __eou__ Did she accept it ? __eou__ No way to know . __eou__
Would you recommend some places for sightseeing ? __eou__ How about Great Canyon ? __eou__ Is it worth seeing ? __eou__ Of course ! It's the most wonderful natural works . __eou__
I just got a telegram from Margaret and Greg . __eou__ Are they coming to Chicago again ? __eou__ Yes . They ’ re coming the beginning of August . __eou__ Oh , good ! We can all get together again . __eou__ I ’ m glad they ’ re coming in August . Maybe Greg and I can play some golf or get tickets to a baseball game . __eou__ And Margaret and I can take the dog and go jogging in the park . __eou__ Remember the garden party they gave when we were in England ? __eou__ Oh , yes . We all sat on the grass , and Margaret played the guitar and sang Greek songs . __eou__ I had a great time . It ’ ll be good to see them again . __eou__
Did you punch in ? __eou__ Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable ! __eou__ Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it . __eou__ Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ? __eou__ Sure , when those never ending meetings . __eou__
I like the kid . He's so lovely . __eou__ How old is he ? __eou__ Twelve . He's very sensible for his age . __eou__
John seems to be in high cotton . He may well become a big shot . __eou__ I bet my button dollar that he won't . He is no more than a nine day's wonder . __eou__ What is your idea ? __eou__ Many people like him get a flying start but soon disappear . __eou__
Hey . Owen ! Have you gone on your family vacation yet ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I got so tired . My son began to cry the moment we got on the train . It was very embarrassing because we took the over-night train and the noise made it difficult for other people in the cabin to sleep . __eou__ Didn't you bring his favorite toy ? __eou__ Yes , we did . Fortunately we put his Teddy Bear in the bag , and finally he fell asleep at mid-night with it in his arms . __eou__ Where did you go ? You've got a beautiful tan . __eou__ My wife didn't like to go to amusement parks , so we compromised and finally went to the seaside . I think vacation in summer is not good . __eou__ You must have had a great time . Most children love to play in the sand on the beach and go swimming . __eou__ Yes , he was every excited to see the blue sea and picked up many seashells to give as gift for his classmates in kindergarten . __eou__ His friends will be very happy to get the little souvenir . __eou__ And I taught him how to swim in the sea . It was fun and made him braver than before . After we returned home , he wasn't afraid to sleep alone in his bedroom . __eou__
This is going to surprise you , but I'm happy . I think you're making the right move . __eou__ You do ? __eou__ Look , maybe I shouldn't tell you this , but I'v going over to WebTracker , too . __eou__ No way ! That's great ! Then we'll still be together ! __eou__ Actually , I'm already working for WebTracker . Vince never wanted to give me what I was worth , so I figured , what the heck . __eou__ No kidding ! I can't believe this . You devil ! __eou__ It's kind of cool , isn't it ? I'm sort of like a secret agent . __eou__
Life's so boring . __eou__ Well , most of the time it is , I guess . __eou__ What do you think will make you happy ? __eou__ I think money will make me happy . __eou__ You heard people say that money doesn't guarantee happiness . __eou__ It will for me . Then I can do all the things I want to do . __eou__ You'll get bored eventually . __eou__ Then I can find something new to do . If I don't have to worry about money , then I don't have to work . __eou__ That's true , I guess . If I didn't have to work , I think I would be happy . __eou__ You see ... money doesn't equal happiness , but it takes away a lot of responsibilities . __eou__
Have you signed up to join the company ’ s Christmas party ? __eou__ Sure , I have . Will you join ? __eou__ I will . You know , as a newcomer , I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere . __eou__ You are right . Our company ’ s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better . It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking . __eou__ I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there . __eou__ No , it will not be formal at all . It is a fun time . You will love the game show . Please dress casually . Usually there is an over abandon of drinks , so be careful with that . __eou__ Don ’ t worry , I can handle that . And I know if the boss is there , even it is an informal evening , it does not make a good impression to get totally drunk in front of him . __eou__
My father ’ s angry face always makes my blood run cold . __eou__ You mean that he is bad-tempered and often gets angry with you . __eou__ Not often . Just when I make mistakes . __eou__
I have never you mention this friend . Are you on very good terms with him or her ? __eou__ We have been on good terms . She is a very nice girl . But she got in Dutch with her boss . I don ’ t have the heart to see her pounding the pavements . __eou__ You must be stuck on her , or you would not use your elbow grease . __eou__ Well , we hit it off with each other . Nothing more , nothing much . __eou__
Crossed cousin marriage is not allowed in China . __eou__ It it true of many countries . __eou__ You know why ? __eou__ Sure . If people are near in blood , they might pass on some genetic disease to the next generation . __eou__
Hello , Susan , it ’ s me , An . __eou__ Hi , An . How are you ? __eou__ I am fine . I am going swimming this afternoon . Are you coming with me ? __eou__ I am afraid I can ’ t this afternoon . I take my daughter to her tennis class at the club on Wednesday afternoons . __eou__ Maybe I can meet you at the club and we can play tennis together . __eou__ Ok , I'll meet you at the club at two thirty . __eou__
Do you have girlfriend ? __eou__ Yes , why ? __eou__ Well , I came to know a girl three weeks ago . We have so much in common . __eou__ So ? __eou__ So I think I may fall in love with her . __eou__ That sounds great . But how do you know that's a crush or a real love ? __eou__ Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in real love ? __eou__ That's a big question . Well , if you're in love , maybe you will take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all . __eou__ That's what I do . __eou__ And you think about her all the time ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ And maybe you suddenly have new interests . I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid . For instance , you used to sleep in every morning , but because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging . __eou__ That's it . She likes dogs so much now , and I begin to love dogs . __eou__ Oh , congratulations . Sounds like you've found your soul mate . __eou__ Thanks , but I know falling in love is one thing while staying in love is another . __eou__ Yes , that's right . If you find this person becomes more and more important to you and you can totally trust her , then you can stay in love . __eou__ Yeah , falling in love is so good . __eou__
What book is that ? __eou__ I just bought a new atlas . I ’ m looking this map of the world . Look at Russia ! That ’ s a vast country . __eou__ Canada , China , and the USA are huge too . __eou__ There are several tiny countries in the world too . Countries like Monaco are smaller than many cities . __eou__ Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia . European countries are relatively small . France looks quite big in Europe , but compared to many countries in other continents , it ’ s not very large at all . __eou__ Britain is half the size of france , but great Britain is still one of the largest islands in the world . __eou__ The thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . Russia and Canada have enormous areas of ice and forest . __eou__
So Peter , do you have a favorite comedy ? __eou__ Well , that's hard to say because there are so many good ones . I don't think I could pick a favorite . __eou__ You know what comedy I really like ? " Ace Ventura , Pet Detective . " I think Jim Carry is really funny . __eou__ Oh yeah , that's one of my favorite flicks . I think Jim Carry is one of the funniest comedians ever . __eou__ I agree . But even though I like comedies , I usually prefer more serious films . My favorite movie is " Titanic . " __eou__
How about a movie tonight ? __eou__ It doesn ’ t matter to me . __eou__ Does 7 o'clock suit you ? __eou__ Either way . I don ’ t care . __eou__ How about a snack after work ? __eou__ I couldn ’ t careless . __eou__ Would you rather stay home ? __eou__ Whatever you say . __eou__ Are you really interested in doing something ? __eou__ I don ’ t mind if you want to . __eou__
I'm going shopping . __eou__ Do you have enough money to buy that dress ? __eou__ No . I need to borrow $ 50 . __eou__ Sure , here you go . __eou__
Do you have any siblings ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I am the oldest child . I have a sister and a brother . My sister is in college and my brother in high school . __eou__ How do you get along with them ? __eou__ We get alone very well . __eou__
What do you think of the test ? __eou__ Rather difficult . How about you ? __eou__ It wasn't too bad . Were you nervous ? __eou__ Rather . I'm afraid I didn't do very well . __eou__ Oh , I wouldn't worry about it . __eou__ That's because you did well . __eou__ No , I wouldn't worry about you . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ It seems to me that you always do better than you say . __eou__
I think that the company retreat should be in the mountains this year . __eou__ What a great idea ! __eou__ January would be a good month for a mountain retreat . __eou__ I like the mountain idea , but I am not so sure about the month of January . __eou__ You know , now that I think about it , you might be right . __eou__ April might be nice . It is far enough away to make the necessary arrangements . __eou__ That is a good suggestion . __eou__ We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them . __eou__ Yeah , that would let us know what would work best . __eou__ I'll put the survey online this afternoon . __eou__
I think he won't remember White Day . __eou__ Silly , you should make sure he does . __eou__ Uh-huh . How about you ? __eou__ He ’ s buying me a handbag , and then dinner at a gorgeous restaurant . __eou__ You got a big return for a small gift . __eou__

All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night . __eou__ You aren ’ t going to a strip club , are you ? I don ’ t want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it ’ s your friends party . __eou__ Aw come on ! It ’ s just some innocent fun ! You know how these things are ! We are gonna play drinking games , get him some gag gifts and just have a good time . Nothing too over the top . __eou__ Well , I don ’ t know . __eou__ Come on !

Are you serious ? __eou__ I'm pulling your leg , Paul . I'm a shopping queen , remember ? So of course I know what a garage sale is all about ! __eou__
It's amazing to me how international business has become . Take my store for example . On any given day , you will find imported items from more than 20 different countries on our shelves . __eou__ How many different varieties of products do you import from China ? __eou__ China provides the bulk of our product inventory , for sure . We import more than 40 different items from China . Most of the imports that come out of China are low-grade plastics or toys . Japan produces many electronic exports , Germany produces excellent mechanical exports . __eou__ Do you import any food items ? __eou__ Generally speaking , food items are difficult to import . Food with the short shelf life is liable to spoil in the time it takes to ship from one place to another . The only food items we import are specialty canned or preserved foods . The shelf life is longer for these products . __eou__
We still have one more day to go before we return home . What will we see tomorrow ? __eou__ No idea . We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . What else is there to see ? __eou__ What about a factory tour ? __eou__ You mean visit a factory ? __eou__ Yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which is open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry . __eou__ Good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ? __eou__ I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour . __eou__ Really ? What do the companies do that for ? __eou__ I believe most of them think it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known . __eou__ Oh , ISEE . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__ Do we need an appointment beforehand ? __eou__ I'll call the tourist information centre to check . __eou__
Here , Let me get the door for you . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ Do you need a hand with that ? __eou__ Actually , i could you some help.Thank you so much . __eou__ Don't worry about it . __eou__

I just had a terrible week . __eou__ what a shame ! __eou__ I fell down and hurt my arm . __eou__ That's too bad . __eou__ Then my son drove into a tree . __eou__ I am sorry to hear that . __eou__ The dog bit the delivery boy . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ And a storm blew our roof away . __eou__ Ho , no ! __eou__

The lawn looks like a green carpet , and the garden with so many lovely flowers . __eou__ We had the grass cut and the flowers trimmed this morning . __eou__ No wonder it smells fragrant . __eou__ Here is the swimming pool and we can swim later . __eou__ It's fantastic ! __eou__
You mean it shuts off to save energy ? __eou__ Yep . And it breathes , see ! __eou__ It's not breathing ! __eou__ Yes , it is . Look at the little light ! It blinks off and on . __eou__ Jen , it's not alive ... but it does look user-friendly . __eou__ I would look so cool carrying this around ! __eou__ And you'd look so cool ! __eou__

As you all should know by now , this class meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:15 to 4:50 . __eou__ That's terrible . He speaks too fast . How can I catch his meaning ? __eou__ Again , as you see on your course outline , grading is determined by your performance on a midterm and a final test , periodic quizzes , and classroom participation . __eou__ I'm not sure whether I can pass the course or not . __eou__
I heard that Janet has got a new job . She ’ s working for the united investment group . I heard that they pay very well . __eou__ I heard that too . She must be making a pocket . Well , good for her . __eou__ Now , she ’ ll be able to save up for that holiday in the united states . __eou__ Yes , she will . At the moment , the exchange rate is very favorable , so she should try to go as soon as possible , while it ’ s cheaper . __eou__ You ’ re right . By the way , did you hear that Tom inherited some money recently ? __eou__ Really ? I thought his parents had died several years ago . __eou__ They did . He inherited the money from an uncle . I hope he doesn ’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government . __eou__ Dying can be very expensive nowadays ! What ’ s he going to do with it ? __eou__ He said that he would probably invest most of it . He ’ s got a well-paid job , so he doesn ’ t need the money to cover day-to day expenses . He just wants some extra money available for when he retires . __eou__ I had some good financial news yesterday too . __eou__ Really ? Have you won a fortune in the lottery ? __eou__ No , but I got a pay rise of 5 % and a bonus for all the hard work I ’ Ve put in recently . I think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way . __eou__ It certainly was ! So , what are you going to do with your windfall ? __eou__
Julia , I saw two men fighting beside our door this morning . __eou__ I know them . They are the two brothers living next door . __eou__ Brothers ? Do you know why they quarreled ? __eou__ It's said that the father's will caused the dissension among the two brothers . __eou__ Is there anybody acting as mediator in the dispute ? __eou__ No , everyone keeps in mind that ' Don't intrude in a family dispute ' . __eou__
I think I'm going to go home . __eou__ Why ? We just got here . __eou__ I know , but it's 12 __eou__ 12 __eou__ Three or four o'clock ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I never stay out that late . That's too late . __eou__ But why is it too late ? It's Saturday night.You have nothing to do tomorrow . Why not stay out and drink with us ? __eou__ Were you so wild when you were still in Taipei , Sharon ? __eou__ Yes , I was . And I like living here.People know how to party here . In Taipei , some people know how to party.But here , everyone does . __eou__ What is that they're doing on the couch ? __eou__ They're smoking pot . Don't worry about it . __eou__ Pot ? Isn't that marijuana ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ But , Sharon , that's illegal ! The police could come , and we could go to jail . __eou__ Don't worry about it . It is true that pot is illegal in America.But the laws aren't as strict as in Taiwan.If people are arrested , and they have a little pot in their possession , they don't go to jail . They just have to pay a fine . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I didn't know you had such wild friends . Do you smoke marijuana too ? __eou__ I tried it a couple times . But I don't like it . I like alcohol better.Don ' t worry about them , though . If you don't want to smoke pot , you don't have to . __eou__ I don't want to . __eou__ That's alright . But you really should have another drink.People will probably start dancing soon . __eou__ I don't know if I can drink more . I already had two drinks . __eou__ You had two drinks at nine o'clock . C'mon , Ann , you are in an American university now ! You have to learn how to drink . __eou__ I thought a university was for studying . __eou__ It is . We study hard all week.And then , on the weekend , we party hard . That's the best way to live . __eou__ Alright . I'll have another drink . __eou__
Hi , Michael , how's it going ? __eou__ Well , things are all right . __eou__ I heard you got a new roommate . What's he like ? __eou__ Yeah , Bob moved in last week . He is a nice guy and so far everything is cool except this girlfriend . __eou__ Oh ? What's wrong with his girlfriend ? __eou__ She came over last weekend . She is a nice girl but there's something about her voice that really creeps me out . I tried to smile and be polite , but the whole time all I could think was " what's wrong with your voice ? " __eou__ Well , I guess it might take some time to get used to . __eou__ I doubt it . Last time was an oral train wreck . Listening to her talk is like chewing tin foil . __eou__ Oh come on , it's not that bad . __eou__ No , it's so much worse . And tonight they invited me out to dinner . I really have no idea how I'm going to pull it off . __eou__ Rough . Maybe you can do the most of the talking . __eou__ That's the plan . __eou__ Good luck . __eou__
Hey . Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail ! __eou__ I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that ! __eou__ Well you can ’ t just take the money . You have to ask the bank for money . And I ’ m the banker . __eou__ Banker ? __eou__ Yes ... __eou__ Can I have my $ 200 please ? __eou__ Sure . Here you are , $ 200 , Thank you , please come again ! Now it ’ s my turn to roll the dice . __eou__

David , do you think which team will get the champion tonight ? __eou__ It is hard to guess now . Both of the teams chose the excellent players this time . I guess the game will end in a tie . They are equally matched . __eou__ I am so nervous now . What a terrific game ! __eou__ Which side are you on ? __eou__ It's hard to say , because each team has my idols . __eou__ Wow ! AC wins . It is a close shave , you know . __eou__ I will never forget this match . The angle is so terrible and so correct . __eou__ What a good goal ! __eou__
There are lots of new teachers in our class this semester . __eou__ Yeah , so what do you think about the teachers ? __eou__ To be honest , I like all of them , except for the math teacher . Though he must be quite young , he seems like an old person . He's so boring . __eou__ I think so too . I don't like him either . Well , who do you like best ? __eou__ It might be the English teacher . What about you ? __eou__ Me , too . She speaks very clearly and doesn't use very complicated words so that it is easy for us to understand her . __eou__ She is a pretty good teacher ! With her help I think I can make great progress in English . __eou__ Yeah , I like her way of teaching . She told us not to cram for exams , and to pay more attention to communicating than memorizing . __eou__ I think it's a good way to develop our language ability . __eou__ Actually , our new math teacher is a good person . He just can't find an appropriate way to teach us . __eou__
Don't cover up your sadness . Let it go . __eou__ I'm sorry . __eou__ It isn't your fault . No one will blame you . __eou__ You are so thoughtful . __eou__

The park is known for them . __eou__ Is there a waterfall ? __eou__ Yes . The well-known Yellowstone Waterfall is formed when the Yellowstone Lake falls down into the Yellowstone Canyon . __eou__ What an attractive place ! How can I get there ? __eou__ You can take No . 2 bus . __eou__
Bobby ! Come here , look what I got you ! __eou__ What is that ? __eou__ A chess board ! Daddy is going to teach you how to play ! __eou__ Cool ! __eou__ Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally . __eou__ What about all these other pieces ? __eou__ See this one that looks like a tower ? It ’ s called the rook . The one with the tall hat is called the bishop . See this little horsey ? This is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it . __eou__ And these two ? They are husband and wife ? __eou__ That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say Check Mate and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ? __eou__ Nah ! This is boring ! I ’ m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation ! __eou__

I ’ ll leaving soon and I need my vise and identity cards badly . __eou__ Oh dear . What a pity . Are you sure you lost your wallet in theatre ? __eou__ Yes , quite sure . __eou__ I think you should put an advertisement in china daily . Things where you lasted . __eou__ But that takes too long . __eou__ Wait a minute , My uncle lives in Beijing and he lives very close to theatre . I ’ Ve telephone here and ask him to go to theatre to require it . We ’ d better have breakfast now . and meet him later . __eou__

This place is so quiet and peaceful . It ’ s really different from my pad at city . __eou__ Sure , do you think you could live out here ? You know , back to nature at all ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . I don ’ t mind coming out here for a while , but that will get old pretty soon . __eou__ That ’ s what I was thinking . I mean can you imagine Friday night instead of going out with your friends you ’ d have to stay in your tree house and talk to birds and squirrels . __eou__ I think I ’ d go lonely if I do like that . __eou__ And where would you get a cup of cappuccino ? __eou__ Now that would be hard to live without . We city folks are pretty spoiled . __eou__ Maybe . But I ‘ d rather be spoiled than turn into a crazy guy with a long period to talk to the birds . __eou__

How about you ? __eou__ I like alternative music . __eou__ do you have a favorite band ? __eou__ to be honest , no . I'm always in search of new music to listen to . __eou__ do you often go to concerts ? __eou__ I usually go to see a live band about twice a month . What about you ? __eou__ I love going to live gigs . Are there any good local bands playing around here that you'd recommend ? __eou__ there's an open mic night at the pub down the road every Thursday night where my favorite local band usually plays .

I'll do it if you're positive that this is what you want . __eou__ I honestly want my hair that short . __eou__ All right , then let's begin . __eou__

You are beautiful ! __eou__ Yes , I am , but I think it ’ s time for some plastic surgery I ’ m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . See ? __eou__ I don ’ t see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You are stop beings ridiculous . Besides , I think that people who get Boto , have facelifts , or tummy tucks look weird.It doesn ’ t look natural . __eou__ Whatever , I think I ’ m gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well . __eou__ I think you need to get brain surgery . I honestly don ’ t think you need cosmetic surgery.You look amazing . __eou__ I thought you were my friend and would support me on this ! I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive . __eou__ You don ’ t need plastic surgery to do that . You are fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you ! Plus , plastic surgery hurts ! __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yeah ! When I got my nose job I was black and blue for a week ! __eou__

I want a game with cards or dice . __eou__ So what do you want to play then ? __eou__ Blackjack.We can play blackjack . And I will gamble one-hundred , or maybe two-hundred dollars . __eou__ Huh ? You are breaking our rule already ! And we didn't even start to play yet ! __eou__ Oh , don't be so strict ! We are in Las Vegas . __eou__ Yes , and if I stay with you , we will have to walk back home to New York.Because we will lose all our money and our plane tickets too ! __eou__
I just won the lottery . __eou__ You're kidding ! __eou__
I didn't expect to see you at this hour . You must have goofed off again . __eou__ Goofed off ? Maybe , but I'm not a clock-watcher . I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier . __eou__ You'll be sorry if you the boss finds it out . He may probably give you the bag . __eou__ I'm sure of what I'm doing . __eou__
Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ? __eou__ Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic . __eou__ What about water pollution instead of pollution ? __eou__ Well done ! __eou__
Look , it's all water over the dam now . Let's leave it behind us . __eou__ Yeah , I know , but it's too hard to do . __eou__ Our eyes should look into the future . We could not live in the past . __eou__ Only sometimes when I think about it , I feel very sad . __eou__ It's normal . Time will change everything . __eou__
Many people say it's a good story.But I think it's boring ! __eou__ I don't think I share your view there.The writer is writing about history , society , human nature and so on.It ' s too hard to understand . __eou__
How good are you at sports , Bill ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? I ’ m terrible ! But I love to watch sports . I go to football or baseball games a lot .

I don ’ t have much time to do those things . __eou__ Oh , I see . You know , we spend time doing different sports . How much time do you spend exercising ? __eou__ Well , I guess I exercise about two hours a day . I do aerobics three times a week , and the other days I play badminton with my husband . I always feel good afterward . __eou__ That ’ s great ! I ’ Ve heard people say that before . __eou__ Well , why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? It ’ s difficult , but very rewarding . __eou__ Oh , I ’ m too lazy to play sports , and I ’ m not good at anything either . It hardly excites me . __eou__
I had broken up with him , how painful I feel . I ’ m going to drown my sorrows . __eou__ I see . But Jane . He ’ s not worth your sorrow and you should restart your new life . __eou__
My brother started investing money when he was 16 years old . __eou__ The early bird catches the worm . __eou__

My treat . __eou__ Actually , I prefer to eat at home , and then we'll have more time to have a chat . __eou__ All right . Let me prepare the supper . __eou__
What do you know about Julia Roberts ? __eou__ Her acting is OK . __eou__ I mean her personality . __eou__ I'm afraid I know less than you do.Tell me more about her , will you ? __eou__

Nice day today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it's beautiful weather we're having . __eou__ We can't complain about the weather recently . __eou__ Yes , the sun shines day after day . It's neither too hot nor too cold . __eou__ I wonder how long this weather can last . __eou__ I hope it will stay fine tomorrow . I'm going to have a picnic with my family . __eou__
Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at the university here ? __eou__ Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad . __eou__ It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing . __eou__ Are you Chinese ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I am from Taiwan . I came here to study political science . __eou__ How do you like it ? __eou__ I like it so far . But my English still needs work . __eou__ I want to study Mandarin and international relations . __eou__ Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters ? __eou__ They teach regular characters . __eou__ I see . I'm from Taiwan , so I know regular characters better than simplified . __eou__ You just said your English needs work , yes ? __eou__ Yes , that's true . Especially my writing . I think my papers aren't good enough . I make too many grammatical mistakes . __eou__ Well , I am very serious about learning Chinese.But for me the hard part now is pronunciation.You have the four tones in Chinese . It is very hard . Maybe , if you have time , maybe we could do a language exchange . __eou__ You mean you and I ? __eou__ Yes , why not ? I mean , if you come to this cafe often , maybe we could meet here and practice Chinese and English . __eou__ That sounds like a good idea . How often would you like to do it ? __eou__ Let's see ... My schedule right now is quite busy.But I think I could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange . __eou__ How would we manage it though ? How would we spend the 90 minutes ? __eou__ First , we could spend 45 minutes working on your English writing.If you want , I could help you edit your papers.Or we could do English conversation . Whatever you want.And then the next 45 minutes you would help me with my Chinese . __eou__ Would I help you with writing ? __eou__ No . For me right now , the important thing is spoken Chinese . I need practice . So you could tutor me in speaking.We could use my textbook , and you could ask me questions.Then you could correct my mistakes . __eou__ I think it sounds like a good system . But when is it convenient to meet ? __eou__ Well , today is Monday.Actually , for me Monday at this time would be the best . I am free from now until 11 __eou__ Me too . In fact , I'm free until 1 __eou__ So if you want to meet at 10 __eou__ It sounds good . I will bring the papers I'm working on . __eou__ And I will bring my textbook and a tape recorder . I would like to record some things so I can practice on my own . __eou__ Let me give you my phone number . __eou__ Sure . I'll give you mine too . Then we can call if we have to cancel for some reason . __eou__
could we possibly discuss my salary some time ? __eou__ sure . __eou__ first of all , I want you to know that I really like working for this company . Do you think I'm doing a good job here ? __eou__ well , you are a very hard-worker . __eou__ I try very hard . The problem is , my salary just isn't enough to live on . Now that I have a wife and a child to support , we hardly have enough money for food and rent . __eou__ there are trying times for everyone . What do you propose ? __eou__ I could really use a 5 % rise . __eou__ that's quite a bit . If I give you a raise , I'm going to have to give everyone a raise . __eou__ listen , if you give me a raise , I'll take on extra responsibilities . __eou__ that sounds reasonable . How about this , from now on , you can be responsible for scheduling . That means that if you can't find someone to cover a shift , then you'll have to do it . __eou__ that's fine . Do I get over-time for any extra hours that I work ? __eou__ of course . It's be against the law if we didn't . __eou__ that sounds good to me . I really appreciate it . __eou__ you are welcome .

Honestly , I was completely blown away by your strategy outline . I've gotta say , Alex , you really wowed me today . __eou__ Aw , come on , it was nothing . I'm just doing my job . __eou__ No , I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean , if I look back on your previous presentations , this is a huge improvement . __eou__ Well , Kristin did give me a hand with the slides.She ' s a real wiz on PowerPoint . __eou__ And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies . I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions . __eou__ Yeah , well , that was some good advice .

What are you listening now , Fred ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ Hey ! Man , put your earphone out . I said which song you are listening to . __eou__ Jay Chou's title song in his new album . __eou__ What's your comment on his new album ? __eou__ Gorgeous !

Do you want your money back ? __eou__ No , can I exchange it for a bigger one ? __eou__ I am afraid this is the biggest size we have . __eou__ Oh , that's too bad . __eou__ Maybe you would like to try this one with the willow pattern . The price is the same and it's bigger . __eou__

So how did he handle it to ? __eou__ His excuse was familiar . He said his car died again . __eou__ I think that's a bunch of nonsense . It seemed ok to me . __eou__ I know . Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy . __eou__ Doesn't sound promising . __eou__ Well , I think it's the time to pull the plug . __eou__ If you want I'll let him know if I run into him . __eou__ Thanks anyway , but I'll do it , Rebecca . Let's get the class . __eou__
Hi , it is a pleasant surprise ! __eou__ Yeah , it ’ s been ages ! So how have you been ? __eou__ Couldn ’ t be better . And you ? __eou__ Just as usual , you know . __eou__

You seem really ticked off . What's up ? __eou__ Just get out of my face , would you ? __eou__ Chill out ! What's eating you , anyway ? __eou__ Sorry . I'm just that I think I blew the final and now my parents are going to get all bent out of shape . I like totally drew a blank on everything ! __eou__ Well , now you're really going to freak out when I tell you who aced it ... what's-her-face ... the one who always kisses up to the teacher . __eou__ Jennifer Davies ? Give me a break ! I can't stand her . She's such a dweeb ! How could she possibly ace it when she keeps cutting class all the time ? __eou__ She's the teacher's pet , that's why . Besides , he's so laid back he lets her get away with it . She just really rubs me the wrong way . And you know what ? I think she's got the hots for him , too . __eou__ Get out of here ! __eou__ I'm dead serious .

Hi Mary , how's it going ? __eou__ well , last night I had a big argument with Ann . __eou__ terrible . It must be something serious . You two are such close friends . __eou__ now that I look back at it , it wawsn't that big a deal . I shouldn't have lost my temper . __eou__ really ? What happened ? __eou__ it's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . Then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she nee __eou__ that's pretty harsh . __eou__ I know , but I was so upset . I mean , come on ! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ? __eou__ you know she probably feels just as bad . __eou__ well , I think I was being a little selfish myself . I know they don't get to see each other very often . __eou__ well , in that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding . You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . After all you can go to the beach anytime you want . __eou__ yeah , I'll call her later to patch things up . __eou__
Henry , I want to ask you something . __eou__ Say what you want to say . __eou__ You see . The wage is not paid yet , I am wondering if you could possibly lend me some money . __eou__ I am sorry . But I do not have any money to lend to you . __eou__

What can I do to lose weight ? __eou__ Well , I exercise a lot . I go running at least three times a week . But more than that I enjoy playing sports and so different sports use different muscles and all of it helps to lose that weight that you might have gained . __eou__ Yeah , well , actually , one of the problems is that I actually exercise a lot . __eou__ Do ya ? __eou__ Yeah , so maybe it's my diet . __eou__ It could be and so in that case you might want to eat something perhaps more nutritious or maybe even less of what you do eat . Maybe , I eat three meals a day and I try not to snack in between . No potato chips . No popcorn . No candy bars . __eou__ That's pretty tough ! __eou__
I don't think the manager will get mad at you for being late . __eou__ I don't know about that . __eou__
I hear you are moving to Dalian . __eou__ Yes . I found a very good job down here . __eou__ Well , we'll certainly miss you here . __eou__ I am going to miss you , too . __eou__ Let's keep in touch . __eou__ OK . I will write to you as soon as I get there . __eou__
Nice weather , honey ! __eou__ The days are getting longer ! __eou__ May and Daniel often like this kind of weather . __eou__ Yeah , they can enjoy themselves in the day time and it is not so hot . __eou__ Honey , how about taking them to the beach this weekend ? __eou__ That's great ! __eou__ Since last time we've climbed the mountain , we haven't gone out for a long time . __eou__ And this kind of weather is rare for the season either . __eou__ Yes , I remember last year this time , the weather is so hot . __eou__ So we must seize this chance to go the beach . __eou__ Daniel loves the beach very much ! __eou__ He will enjoy himself this weekend . __eou__
Have you met John recently ? __eou__ I saw him last week . It seems he was a bit queer in the head . __eou__ Yes , he has been like that since his accident . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__
What are you doing tonight ? __eou__ I have to run to the grocery store . __eou__ Don't you hate fighting the crowds on the weekends ? __eou__ Yes , but I am out of food and milk . __eou__ What store do you shop at ? __eou__ The small one , just down the street . I like their generic brand . __eou__ I have been using the store across town for years . __eou__ I hear they have very nice stuff . __eou__ They do , but they're a little expensive on certain items . __eou__ Well , you should try my store . The prices are good . __eou__ I will sometime . Thanks for the advice . __eou__
I'm happy to see you again . __eou__ Me too . __eou__ We should do this more often . __eou__ Okay , I'll give you a ring next week . __eou__
What will happen to the children if you break up ? __eou__ That's a relief for me and a misery for the children . __eou__ Why don't you make up with John . __eou__ It's too late . __eou__
What upsets you ? __eou__ My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s.Easier set than done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date . __eou__ It is not your mother finding one for you ? __eou__ I will find one myself , of course . I ’ m a modern girl . __eou__ Perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type . __eou__ You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea . __eou__ No , there is an updated version , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes . __eou__ I don ’ t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time . __eou__ I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so-called love at first sight . __eou__ Anyway , I don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . There are many other options using the internet as dating methods . Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . __eou__ Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional . The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher . __eou__ I don ’ t want to post my personal information on the internet . I ’ m not knowing who is reading it . __eou__
Hi , dear , I've got your voice at last . __eou__ Hi , darling , I am thinking it is the time of your calling . __eou__ Are you OK today ? __eou__ Quite good except thinking of you so much . __eou__ So do I . You are a beautiful flower in my mind . __eou__ It's called love is blind , I think . __eou__
Did you watch the movie program on Channel 6 last night ? __eou__ Yes , I did . It is a horrible movie . __eou__ I wonder why TV programs often show much violence . __eou__ Actually , more and more people have realized that violence on TV may lead to the increase of crime rates among teenagers . __eou__ They are especially harmful to teenagers . __eou__ But anyhow there are many worthwhile programs . __eou__
I hate to see the abuse of animals . __eou__ It makes me sick . __eou__
Hi ! Bob , are you having problems with that ? __eou__ Yes , how should I set up my new computer ? __eou__ It's easy , let me help you . __eou__ Great , thanks a lot . __eou__
Good morning , Mr.Jones ! __eou__ Good morning , Miss Bell ! __eou__ Nice to see you again . __eou__ Nice to see you too.It ' s been a long time . __eou__ How is everything ? __eou__ Just fine , and you ? __eou__ Quite well , thank you . __eou__ Did you drive yourself to the airport ? __eou__ No , I was driven by my husband . __eou__ Did someone meet you at the airport here ? __eou__ Yes , thanks . __eou__ Is this where we'll be holding the meeting ? __eou__ No , the meeting will be held on the fourth floor . __eou__
What should we do this Saturday ? __eou__ Rocky six is suppose to come out this Friday . __eou__ Yeah , but I don't know if it is going to be any good . __eou__ The only reason I want to see it is because I have seen the previous five . __eou__ True . Ok . Let's see it this Saturday . __eou__ How about we hook up for lunch at 12:00 , and then go see the movie afterwards . __eou__ Sounds like a plan . Let's meet in front of Tower Records at 12:00 . __eou__
It's almost Christmas . What are you doing this weekend ? __eou__ Nothing special , just working . Why do you ask ? __eou__ Well , I still haven't finished my Christmas shopping . Do you want to go shopping with me this weekend ? __eou__ I'd like to , but I'm not sure if I can . Work has been really busy lately . Why don't we go on Friday instead ? __eou__ Friday's not good . I think the stores will be very crowded and I have to work . __eou__ OK , then let's try to go this weekend . I should know if I can go by Friday . Is it OK if I call you then ? __eou__ Yeah , that's fine . __eou__ What's your number ? __eou__ 233-331-8828 . Let me give you my email address too . It's Tom861@gmail.com __eou__ OK , I'll talk to you soon . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Can I borrow these magazines ? __eou__ Fill in the slip , then take it to the circulation desk . They will get you what you want . __eou__ Are we allowed to go into the stacks to look for books ? __eou__ Sorry , the stacks are closed to undergraduate students . __eou__
I never watch foreign films . They're too boring . __eou__ Jason , you have no taste . You think First Blood is a good movie . __eou__ Hey , it is ! A lot of people like that movie ! __eou__ I'm sorry , but it's a bad movie . The plot is stupid , and the script is poorly written . __eou__ Face it , you don't like action movies because you're a snob . __eou__ No , I don't like action movies because I'm cultured ! __eou__
This is tough to say , John , but I think we should break up . __eou__ Are you serious ? __eou__ Yes , I mean it . __eou__ But why ? Did I do anything wrong ? __eou__ No , we are just too different . This relationship isn't going anywhere . __eou__ Hey , come on . It's too early to say that . We can fix things . __eou__ I have thought about it for a long time . I think it's time to move on for both of us . __eou__ But I still love you . __eou__ I'm sorry . __eou__ I knew this would happen some day ... __eou__ Then why didn't you talk to me ? __eou__ Well . It's not all my fault , Anna ... __eou__ I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough , but let's try to forget that and be friends . __eou__ Have you made the decision yet ? __eou__ I think we'll be better off if we are apart . __eou__ Then shall we keep pure friendship ? __eou__ Sure , let's just be friends . __eou__
Hi , charlie , are you busy this evening ? __eou__ Sorry , I'm afraid that I've got plans tonight . __eou__ What are you doing ? __eou__ I'm going to my parents ' house for my father's birthday . __eou__ How old is he today ? __eou__ It's his 50th birthday . __eou__ Well , wish him a happy birthday for me . __eou__ Sure thing . What are your plans for the evening ? __eou__ I was just thinking of going to a movie tonight . __eou__ Well , if you can wait until tomorrow night , I'll go with you then . __eou__ Sorry , I've got people coming over tomorrow night . __eou__ Sounds like this weekend just isn't going to work out for us . __eou__ Sounds that way . Maybe some other time then ? __eou__ Sure.Hey , I'm sorry , but I've got to get going . __eou__ Yeah , me , too . It's about time I made a move . __eou__ Say hello to your friends for me . __eou__ Likewise . See you later . __eou__ Bye ! __eou__
I was wondering if you could help me to get a library card . __eou__ Of course , just fill out this form and let me know when you are finished . __eou__ I'm finished . __eou__ I will also need your driver's license ; hand me the filled-out form , please . __eou__ OK , the form is all filled out . __eou__ Perfect !

Hey Joanne . What are you up to ? __eou__ I'm just watching some television . __eou__ I'm so bored . I don't know what I'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning . __eou__ Me too . Do you think we are boring people ? __eou__ I don't think we are boring . It's just that we don't have any hobbies . __eou__ That's right . What do you think we should do as a hobby ? __eou__ That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings . __eou__ I like to play the piano for fun . __eou__ Yeah . That can be a good hobby . __eou__ Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do . __eou__ That's a great idea . I'm going to do the same . __eou__

What was that all about ? __eou__ No ... that's not what I meant . I didn't mean that . She asked me where you were and I jokingly said that you were on a date with Sara . I thought Martha knew that you and Sara were just friends . __eou__ She started feeling suspicious after you said that . __eou__ I'm sorry man . I didn't know . I didn't mean to screw anything up . __eou__ Martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that Sara was just a friend . Now , I have to explain to Sara that I can't hang around her because of you . __eou__ Look . I really didn't mean to , and next time I see Martha , I'll really tell her that you and Sara are really just friends . __eou__ Don't bother . __eou__
Shall we for go out for a meal this evening ? __eou__ I don ’ t really mind . __eou__ We can go to that new Chinese restaurant . __eou__ I suppose I could . __eou__ Come on , let ’ s try it . __eou__ All right . If you really want to . __eou__

Do you know what a handicapped space is ? __eou__ Yes , I have seen those spots . __eou__ Well , when you see the blue spots with the handicapped logo , do not park there unless you have a special permit . Are you going to be parking in the daytime or the evening ? __eou__ I park in the evenings . __eou__ Then you also need to be aware of the time limits on the street signs . Have you seen those signs ? __eou__ Yes , I have seen those signs . __eou__ The signs always tell you how long you can park there and on what days . Do you know how to read the curb colors ? __eou__ Yes , I know what the curb colors mean . __eou__ Well , just as long as you realize that red means no parking and white means loading and unloading , I think you know what you need to know . __eou__
How long have you been in America ? __eou__ For more than five years . __eou__ Do you think it's easy for a Chinese to get accustomed to the western culture ? __eou__ It's no picnic . __eou__
There are things that are actually even smaller than atoms . __eou__ What are those ? __eou__ They are the things that make up the atom , such as electrons and protons . __eou__ Is there anything that is smaller than electrons and protons ? __eou__ Of course there is . Things can be divided and broken down into indefinitely small parts if we can . __eou__ I really don't want to know about this . Physics gives me a headache . __eou__
Guess what I've brought for you . __eou__ Oh , a bouquet of flowers . It's very kind of you . __eou__ I hope you like it . __eou__ I love flowers , you know . Thank you very much . __eou__ That's all right . __eou__

I can ’ t decide what to do today . __eou__ Well . Let ’ s go swimming . __eou__ Don ’ t you think it ’ s a bit cold for that ? __eou__ Then why don ’ t we go for a walk in the hills . It ’ d be very good for us you know . __eou__
Car trouble center . How may I help you ? __eou__ My car won ’ t start ! Stupid old car ! __eou__ Hold on , before you kick your car let ’ s go through some possible problems . __eou__ Fine . __eou__ OK , first of all , can you turn the key in the ignition ? __eou__ Yeah ! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor . __eou__ Those are possible problems , but tell me , when you turn the key , do you hear the starter motor crank ? __eou__ Yeah , it sounds like it usually does when I start the car , but nothing else happens . The engine won ’ t start . Should I maybe press the accelerator ? __eou__ No . If you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start . __eou__ So what do you think it is ? __eou__ I know this may seem like a silly question , but does your car have gasoline ? __eou__ Umm . yeah ! Right ! I got the car started ! Thanks for your help ! I told you to fill the tank ! __eou__
I quit my job . __eou__ You can't be serious . __eou__
Do you have a copy of today ’ s newspaper ? I want to check the results from the world athletics championship . __eou__ Yes , I ‘ m just reading them myself . It ’ s been a great competition . We got gold medals in three events . __eou__ Yes , we won the men ’ s 110 metres hurdles . I watched that on TV . What other events did we win ? __eou__ We won the men ’ s high jump and the women ’ s 1500 meters . __eou__ That ’ s great . Those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition . They must be terribly disappointed if they don ’ t win . __eou__ The woman who won the 1500 meters also broke the world record by 2 seconds . __eou__ That ’ s amazing ! Were any other records broken ? __eou__ A Russian man broke the discus record by a centimeters . Out best athlete broke his personal best in the long jump , but it only got him third place . __eou__ Did you see the final of the men ’ s 100 metres ? It was very exciting . One competitor made two false starts . __eou__ Was he disqualified ? __eou__ Yes , he was . I imagine he must be very angry with himself for that . __eou__
Hi , Ellen . That outfit looks terrific ! __eou__ Thanks , Jim . I didn ’ t think guys paid attention to stuff like that . __eou__ No , we just don ’ t usually admit it ! __eou__ Well , thanks for the compliment anyway ! __eou__
Hey , Mike . Can I ask you something ? __eou__ Sure , what's up ? __eou__ I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . Who do you think will win ? __eou__ Good question . I have to think about it . __eou__ My husband is betting on France . __eou__ France ? Is he crazy ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , how can I put this ? France is a terrible team . __eou__
Is there something wrong ? You look so sad . __eou__ My house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture . __eou__ No wonder you look so upset . Have you called the police ? __eou__ Yes , I have . But I have to wait . __eou__
How are you feeling , John ? __eou__ Oh , not too bad , but I've got to stay in bed . __eou__ Do more exercises after you are healthy . __eou__ Ok , I will . You have said that many times . __eou__ Are you hungry ? Do you want me to buy something for you to eat ? __eou__ No , there ’ s no need . Thank you all the same . __eou__
did you go to university ? __eou__ yes , I graduated with a BA in English from Qingdao University . __eou__ when did you graduate ? __eou__ just a few years ago . What about you ? __eou__ I just graduated from high school . __eou__ are you planning on going to university ? __eou__ I'd like to get a BA , but I don't know where I should go . __eou__ have you applied anywhere yet ? __eou__ yes , I've applied to four universities and have been accepted into all of them . __eou__ congratulations ! Which one is the cheapest ? __eou__ the tuition is the same for all of them . __eou__ which one has the most interesting course ? __eou__ I think the course at Leeds University is interesting , but I think the one at Manchester University would be more practical . __eou__ where would you like to be located ? __eou__ I'd really like to be in London , but it's the most expensive city in England to live in , so I don't know if I can afford to live there . __eou__ have you applied for grants or financial aid of some sort ? __eou__ not yet . __eou__ I think you should do that soon . It will help you make a decision about the school you go to . __eou__ that's a good idea . __eou__ good luck ! __eou__
Excuse me , could you spare me a few minutes ? __eou__ Yes , certainly.How can I help you ? __eou__ Do you know if train 10 is on time to be here ? __eou__ Sorry , I don ’ t know . I ’ m a passengers ’ m waiting for my train .. __eou__ Do you mind if I read your newspaper for a while ? __eou__ Certainly not.Here it is . __eou__ Thanks a lot __eou__
Would you like a cup of coffee ? __eou__ Yes.That would be good . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ This machine is out of order . __eou__ You shouldn't have used the machine.Did you lose your money ? __eou__ I sure did . __eou__ You ought to complain.These machine are always out of order . __eou__
You seem to like her very much , don't you ? __eou__ I can't deny that . She is so beautiful that I fell in love with her at the first sight . I wish I knew more about her . __eou__ But I heard that she had a three-year-old girl . __eou__ I cannot belive that . It must be cooked up by someone . __eou__
There are so many environment problems in the world today . Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ? __eou__ I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan of action , but I doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late . __eou__ We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . There ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . Developing countries __eou__ Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ’ re not thinking a __eou__ In other parts of the world , especially in Africa , there is a problem with desertification . Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . In means that people cannot grow e __eou__ It also means that people sometimes fight over the farmland that remains . Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people . __eou__ Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment . __eou__ I think I ’ d like to do that . I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies . __eou__
Going to the cafeteria ? __eou__ No , I am not eating there anymore . I have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . The food served in the cafeteria is not my type . I am a total meat lover . But the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . They have been serving the Chinese cabbage and white gorse for three days . Haven ’ t you noticed that ? __eou__ That ’ s fine with me . I don ’ t hate vegetables and I don ’ t eat much during lunch . __eou__ Well , then the cafeteria suits you best . But anyway , if you like to have a lunch outside the company , feel free to join me anytime . __eou__
How old are you ? __eou__ That's a secret . __eou__
I've brought a little dog for Alice , girls usually like looking after pets . __eou__ Thank you , but Alice is only a visitor here . I don't know if she'll keep it . __eou__ To tell you the truth , the dog isn't my real reason for coming . I want to ask Alice if she'd like to be my girlfriend . __eou__ Really ? __eou__
hi , I'm Lucas , I just moved in next door . __eou__ oh , hi Lucas , come on in . I'm Barbara . Nice to meet you . __eou__ nice to meet you too . __eou__ would you like something to drink ? I've got tea and some grape juice . __eou__ thanks . Some tea would be nice . Chinese tea is great . I really like your tea set . Where did you get it ? __eou__ oh , there is a supermarket not far from here . But there is also a tea house around the corner , where you can get tea and a tea set as well . __eou__ oh yeah , I saw the tea house the other day . I think I might go and have a look sometime . It's a nice neighborhood here . __eou__ you are right about that . It's quiet and very convenient . You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes'walk . There's a grocery store , a book store , a gym , and many restaurants __eou__ there's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight . __eou__ well , if you want we can go together sometime . Actually I was thinking of going this afternoon , if you like , you can join me and I can show you the neighborhood along the way . __eou__ that would be wonderful . Thanks ! __eou__
I am totally fed up with my boss . He has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments . This time I am really going to report him for sexual harassment . __eou__ What happened ? Did your boss say something to offend you at work ? __eou__ He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out , referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment . __eou__ Don ’ t you think you are overreacting a little ? Calling you by nicknames shouldn ’ t be so bad ... __eou__ You ’ re missing the point . It ’ s about respect . He treats us with such a patronizing attitude , as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers . It ’ s his attitude that needs to be changed , not just his words . __eou__ That ’ s what you get for working in a male-dominated field . I think you ’ ll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way . You probably won ’ t be able to change him . __eou__
Is your lady beautiful ? Since I came here from the country , I've not seen her close . Tell me , is she beautiful ? __eou__ Thomas , if I could write with the beauty in her eyes , I was born to look in them and know myself . __eou__ And , her lips ? __eou__ Her lips ? The early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy . __eou__ And her voice like a lark's song ? __eou__ Deeper , softer , none of your twittering larks . I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupted her song . __eou__ Oh , she sings too ? __eou__ Constantly . Without doubt , and plays the lute . She has a natural ear . __eou__
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ? __eou__ Sorry , I have to work overtime . __eou__ You are really career minded . __eou__ My boss promised to pay me double time . __eou__
It's going to strike 12 o'clock . Let's get the firecrackers ready , Rose . __eou__ Aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city ? __eou__ Well yes , but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . It's OK here . It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there . __eou__ Fantastic ! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds ! __eou__ What other activities will you have tomorrow ? __eou__ Quite a lot . The celebration of the New Year has just started . The first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast , and people in the North have Jiaozi . Afterward , we will make New Year calls on family relatives , husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second . __eou__ Do you bring some gifts along ? __eou__ That's for sure . Fruit , cream cakes , medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives , and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids . All this , of course , should be well prepared beforehand . __eou__ Is it the same practice for all families ? __eou__ Not all the same nowadays I must say . Many families , especially those of newly married couples , choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines . Rose and I had a tour to Singapore , Malaysia , Thailand and Hong Kong last year . We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday . __eou__ I really appreciate the way you Chinese people exchange feelings . The holiday's long enough for you to relax . __eou__ Well , for city dwellers , the Spring Festival is a holiday of seven days . While in the country where traditions are still heavily emphasized , the festival lasts ten days . __eou__
You seem to be very hesitant about doing things . __eou__ I don't know why I cannot take a step forward . __eou__ You are meeting trouble halfway , I guess . __eou__ Many things are troubling me . I don't know whether I should come and go . __eou__ That's where the shoe pinches . __eou__
How's your new apartment ? __eou__ I thought it was in a quiet neighborhood , but it isn't . __eou__ What's wrong ? __eou__ One of my neighbors has a dog . __eou__ Does it make a lot of noise ? __eou__ It barks all night long . __eou__
Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money . __eou__ Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ? __eou__ Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg . __eou__ I don ’ t know about that ; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate . __eou__ But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity . And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example , they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity . __eou__ Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point . __eou__ Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash . __eou__
What do you think of smoking ? __eou__ It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others . __eou__ What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? __eou__ Stop producing cigarettes . __eou__ But that ’ ll affect the national economy . __eou__ That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways . __eou__ How about printing a warning on each cigarette packet ? __eou__ Maybe it can take effect . __eou__
do you like playing games ? __eou__ I like playing computer games , but I'm not really into board games . __eou__ how about individual games like the Rubik's cube or solitaire ? __eou__ the Rubik's cube is so difficult to solve that I think it should be banned ! __eou__ if I taught you how to do it , I'm sure you could solve it . __eou__ how did you figure out how to slove the Rubik's cube ? __eou__ I didn't really have to figure it out . I just followed the instructions ! __eou__ I had no idea there were a set of instructions . I thought everyone who could solve it were all geniuses ! __eou__ hints are really important when you're solving puzzles . If you give me some hints about playing that PS2 game , I ’ ll show you how to solve the Rubik's cube . __eou__ it's a deal . __eou__ do you remember , years ago , when everybody at the New Year's party had yo-yos ? __eou__ yeah . That was a strange party . Can you still do any of those yo-yo tricks ? __eou__ I don't know . I haven't tried yo-yo since that party ! __eou__ I could never figure out how to use my yo-yo . __eou__ if you don't start when you're young , it's hard to get the hang of it . __eou__ let's get started with this game then . __eou__ ok . __eou__
A beautiful center ! __eou__ And good shot ! __eou__ A goal ! __eou__
Mary , there's one more thing that you must do for me before you leave . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ You have to take the math and English evaluation tests . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because you're from a foreign country . The school needs to find out how good you are at both basic skills . __eou__ It's so that I can be put into the right math and English classes , right ? __eou__ You are a smart girl ! __eou__ This is going to take more time than I thought . __eou__
I have a bone to pick with you . __eou__ Okay . Let ’ s clear the air . What are you getting at ? __eou__ You always have a chip on your shoulder . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . But I don ’ t meant to get your goat . __eou__
OK , Nick . Here's the question , What movie and its sequel both won an Oscar for Best Picture ? __eou__ The Godfather and The Godfather II , of course . They were both directed by Francis Ford Coppola . __eou__ Whew ! I'm impressed ! You really know your stuff ! __eou__ Only about old movies , really ... __eou__
It is obvious that their government is nursing the hope of having all other countries over a barrel and bring them completely under their control . __eou__ It ’ s a typical of them to do so . __eou__ What can we do ? __eou__ We must keep developing our economy and unite with other developing countries to fight against it . __eou__
This is today ’ s schedule . At eight thirty , conference with the department managers . At 9 o ’ clock , live for the workshop where you ’ ll award prizes to the stafffor preventatives . __eou__ That ’ s great . What are the prizes ? __eou__ 3000 RIB as bonus for each person . __eou__ To encourage the staff increases . __eou__ Ok . Next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 AM . At 12 AM , back here for lunch . __eou__ What about the afternoon ? __eou__ At 2 PM , give a presentation here with the press . At four o ’ clock sharp , have dinner with Mr . Smith , manager of NCC . __eou__
How do you get along with your co-workers ? __eou__ I get along pretty well with most of them.It seems there are always a few rotten apples in the bunch , though , Like Margaret . I don't know why management hasn't fired her yet.She ' s a terrible gossip . __eou__ Do you think management should fire someone just because they gossip ? __eou__ It's not only that she gossips , but she also tries to start problems among other employees by spreading rumors and telling lies about her co-workers.She ' s not trustworthy , and in my opinion , I think she's nuts . __eou__ So how do you develop good relationships in the office ? __eou__ I think one of the important things is just to be considerate of your co-workers'feelings and needs.If you are aware of other people and do your part to make a good working environment , you should be able to get along with most of the people you work with . __eou__ I think you're right , but it does seem that there are always a few co — workers that are harder to work with than others . __eou__
Thanks a lot for having us . We had a good time . __eou__ I'm glad you came . You're welcome anytime . __eou__ Thanks . By the way , tell your wife she throws a great party . __eou__ I will . See you later . __eou__
So how did you meet Bill ? __eou__ I met him through a computer bulletin board . __eou__ Oh , really ? Which bulletin board ? __eou__ It was one I used down at the local coffee house called the San Francisco Net . It's been around since around 1991 . __eou__ I've heard about that , but I've never tried it . __eou__ You ought to . One dollar buys you 15 minutes of computer time . A Chat session links you with cappuccino sippers in other cafes and also to home computers on the network . __eou__ I have no desire to talk on a network with a bunch of strangers . __eou__ That's the whole point . All your inhibitions disappear because you can ’ t see the other person . This network allows you to talk to people whom you normally wouldn ’ t talk to . __eou__ I just want a private conversation with one other person . __eou__ You can do that . A private session lets two people talk alone . This techno-chat program lets you talk about anything with everybody , without prejudice because you can ’ t see them . __eou__ Well , maybe I'll tag along and watch how you talk . __eou__ That's fine with me , but we'll have to get there early . Because after 8 pm , there is always a long line . __eou__ It ’ s that popular ? __eou__ It sure is . __eou__
Have you seen that house ? __eou__ Yes , it looks interesting . __eou__ You're right . I love it very much . __eou__ It must be old . __eou__ At least more than 100 years old . __eou__ Let's enter it ! __eou__ I can't open the door . __eou__ It must be locked . __eou__ Let me ask the old woman in that reception office . __eou__ She can't answer you . __eou__ She must be deaf . __eou__ It must be a haunted house . Are you frightened ? __eou__ Frightened ? You must be joking . __eou__
Have a nice weekend ! __eou__ Thanks.You too ! __eou__ Do you have any plans ? __eou__ Well , my family's away and I can't afford to do much.What about you ? __eou__ Oh , I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet . __eou__
What did you major in ? __eou__ I major in Chemistry . __eou__ What is your specialty ? __eou__ Organic Chemistry is my specialty . __eou__
The National Day is coming . What are you going to do during the holiday ? __eou__ I have no idea . __eou__ Why don't you go sightseeing ? __eou__ It isn't a good time because there must be many tourists in the scenic spots . What about your plans ? __eou__ I intend to stay at home for the whole seven days and have a good rest . __eou__
Good morning , John . Have you finished reading the novel by Dickens borrowed from the library ? __eou__ No . I caught a cold two days ago . I only finish reading half of it . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . How are you feeling now ? __eou__ I'm feeling better today . __eou__ How many days do you plan to finish reading it ? __eou__ About more three days , I think . __eou__ OK . After three days , I will come to you for it . __eou__ No problem . __eou__
Ouch ! __eou__ Are you all right ? __eou__ Yeah , I just bumped into the table . __eou__
Hi , Lilly , it ’ s so nice to see you again . __eou__ Hum , me too . This winter holiday was especially long . What have you done ? __eou__ Nothing special . I had a get-together with some schoolmates at the high school , visited the Internet and read a couple of books which I had been longing for . How about yours ? __eou__ You know , I like traveling . I made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself . __eou__
You know , I really don ’ t think Americans are very romantic . __eou__ Where did you get that idea ? __eou__ That ’ s the impression I get from the movies , and from looking around . Men and women seem very business-like in their relations with each other . __eou__ Well , I ’ m still not sure what you ’ re asking me . __eou__ Is it true or isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Do you want to know something about the American character ? __eou__ I just think you ’ re trying to change the subject . But go ahead . __eou__ No , this will help answer your question . In American society boys and girls are raised together . They ’ re not segregated in their activities ! Boys and girls go out together from an early age . __eou__ OK , go on . __eou__ After being raised together , men and women can be business-like in each other ’ s company . It really doesn ’ t have anything to do with the way a man and woman behave toward each other when they are in love . Does that answer your question ? __eou__ Not exactly , but I see your point . __eou__ I think Americans are pretty romantic when they are in a relationship and a lot of flirting goes on in every office . After you ’ Ve been in America for a while , you will probably see what I mean . __eou__
It's a lovely day , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , the weather sure is nice today . __eou__ I love it when the weather is like this.Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ? __eou__ That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot . __eou__ I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado.but I must admit , this sure is a nice spring day . __eou__ Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable . __eou__ Okay.Hey , is that a dark cloud over there ? Do you think it will rain after all ? __eou__ I don't think so . I say the weather report last night , and it said the weather should be fine all day . __eou__ If the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend.It ' s been a while since I've not really gotten some sun . __eou__
Are you going to the cafeteria downstairs ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Could you please get me a takeaway ? I have some urgent work to finish . So I don ’ t have enough time to go out for lunch . __eou__ No problem . What should I bring ? __eou__ I am not picky on food . Just bring me the day menu . __eou__
What's your weight ? __eou__ 150 pounds . __eou__ Do put yourself on a diet , otherwise you'll be too fat . __eou__ I can't bear eating less . __eou__
Did you ever take History 231 ? __eou__ Yeah . Last semester . __eou__ Who was the professor ? __eou__ It was Professor Johnson . __eou__ I have him this semester . What do you think about him ? __eou__ He's a terrible instructor and demands a lot , but fortunately , he's an easy grader . __eou__ What did you end up getting ? __eou__ I got an A - . Sounds good , but none of my test scores were that high , so I don't know how I got a decent grade . __eou__ That's probably because he grades on a curve . __eou__ Are you enjoying the class so far ? __eou__ I hate it and I was about to withdrawal . But after hearing your experience , I think I will tough it out . __eou__ Yes . Definitely stay in the class . You will get a better grade than your test scores . He does that deliberately to make all the students study a lot . __eou__ Thanks for letting me know . I feel relieved now . __eou__
So how long have you known Mary ? __eou__ Only four days . __eou__ Only four days ! That's so short , and you seem so crazy about her . __eou__ I know . I can't help thinking about her . She's always on my mind . __eou__
Hi , happy new year ! __eou__ Hey , the same to you ! __eou__ Time flies ! One year has already been a history ! __eou__ Definitely , it's time to say bye-bye to the last year and to say hello to the new year ! __eou__ Yeah . Have you made any good resolutions for this new year ? __eou__ Some resolutions ? That's a wonderful idea , but I have no idea yet . How about you ? __eou__ I want to be healthier this year , so I think I should take more exercise . __eou__ That will be a good one ! Anything else ? __eou__ Maybe I should make a plan about learning my biochemistry , which is a mess ! __eou__ Sounds great ! __eou__
It's weekend again , I'm glad I can arrange for my personal matters . __eou__ What do you mean by that ? __eou__ Oh , that means I can do whatever I like without few interruptions . __eou__ You've been always active and versatile . It seems that you are interested in everything . __eou__ Oh , really ? I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert , painting , handwriting , reading novels and reading fashion magazines . What about yours ? __eou__ I have fewer hobbies than yours . That's why I find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting . __eou__ Oh , you can't think like that . We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . You like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ? __eou__ That's a good suggestion . It's fine today . Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . It must be fantastic . __eou__ I quite agree with you . With our hobbies , our life can be more colorful and exciting . __eou__ And I can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend . __eou__ Yes , it's a good habit to have a life-long hobby . Those who practise calligraphy and Qigong always live longer . __eou__
Hey , Jane ... are you familiar with our company's insurance policies ? __eou__ Umm ... I think so . What's up ? __eou__ I've never really paid attention to the fine print of our insurance policies ... but it looks like I'm going to need to make a claim . __eou__ Really ? Are you OK ? __eou__ I have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option . Does our worker insurance cover this kind of thing ? __eou__ If the injury is workplace related I'm sure it's completely covered . __eou__ Hummum ... I think I'll have to talk to the doctor again about that.Anyway ... now that I'm going to have to make some claims , I think I'd better try and understand how the system works . Would you mind breaking it down for me ? __eou__ Sure . Basically we have two insurance policies for employees ... workman's compensation and medical insurance . The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation , and for a significant part of the medical coverage , but you pay part of that premium , too . __eou__ That's the charge for insurance I see on my pay slip each month , right ? __eou__ Yep . Every country in the world has a different system , but here we buy insurance from a private provider . __eou__ So workman's compensation is if I slip and break my arm while working in the office or on the job , right ? __eou__ That's right . The company pays for all your medical bills and there is also some financial compensation if you have to take days off to see doctors or spend time recuperating . __eou__
I decided to go for this kind of life . __eou__ Try to keep cool . It's not an easy take . __eou__ I know . I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst . __eou__ Then you will be in line for a doom . __eou__

So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ? __eou__ The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone . __eou__ Wow ! What a hit ! __eou__ Yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off . __eou__ Is he ok ? __eou__ It looks like it , he ’ s getting up . __eou__ I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team . __eou__ The Giants ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Well , here we go again . __eou__ What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ? __eou__ The Redskin ’ s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . We ’ re losing again . __eou__

I can't stand the stupid guy any longer.It ' s unbelievable ! __eou__ Oh , my dear lady.Take it easy.You should forgive a green hand like him . __eou__ He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . __eou__ I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . __eou__ I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . __eou__ Maybe you should communicate with him like a friend and not a boss . __eou__ Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . __eou__ Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper . __eou__ I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend.How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ? __eou__ I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions . __eou__

Frank , I want your advice on something . Some scientists I met at the conference 6 this afternoon have invited me to a party . Actually , they called it an informal get-together . __eou__ And what ’ s the problem ? __eou__ When I asked how people were going to dress , Dr . Lite said it was casual . __eou__ And you want to know what to wear ? __eou__ Well , last night I went out with some journalists for a casual party , but I was overdressed . I wore what I consider casual - - an outfit of skirt , blouse , scarf , and medium heels ... you know . __eou__ That sounds just right to me . What was wrong with it ? __eou__ Everyone else there was wearing blue jeans . Several of the women had on running shoes . I felt out of place . So I have no idea what to wear tonight . __eou__ My guess is you can safely wear last night ’ s outfit to tonight ’ s party . __eou__

I ’ Ve always wondered , what ’ s the difference between English for Chinese students and English for native students ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . What do you think ? __eou__ I think a Chinese student concentrates on written English , and uses it as a basis for communicating . From start to finish he ’ s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . This is a very difficult way to learn . __eou__ What do natives get ? __eou__ They get higher level English , which is more formal than everyday spoken English . They also deal with matters of style and creativity . __eou__ Do you mean that a native doesn ’ t make any mistakes in grammar ? __eou__ Absolutely not ! Native speakers make a lot of grammar mistakes , especially if they come from a home where nonstandard English is spoken . __eou__ I suppose that only a small percentage of college students don ’ t know standard English in American universities . __eou__ Actually there are more non-native speakers than you think . That ’ s why it ’ s so important to quit worrying about making mistakes . Just talk to everyone every chance you get . __eou__

You can have my US Dollars , I don ’ t need them . __eou__ Really ? That ’ s very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing . __eou__ You needn ’ t buy one . You can have mine . __eou__ That ’ s very kind of you , Helen . I hope you don ’ t mind my leaving you like this . I need a holiday . It won ’ t be long . __eou__ Don ’ t be silly , John . I ’ m going with you . It ’ s necessary for me to have a holiday too . __eou__
Is that your phone ? __eou__ yes , it's my new business phone . Do you like it ? __eou__ it's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ? __eou__ yes , it's got wireless Internet access . __eou__ that's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ? __eou__ yes , but I don't really use it that often . Have you ever used it ? __eou__ no , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . __eou__ yes , I guess I should try to use it . __eou__ does it have a camera ? __eou__ of course it does . Doesn't every new phone include a camera these days ? __eou__ I guess so . Would you mind if I checked my email quickly ? I'm supposed to be getting an important email this evening from a client . __eou__ sure . Here you go . __eou__ have you checked your voicemail recently ? __eou__ no , why ? __eou__ I think this icon means that you have a voicemail message . __eou__ oh , yeah . Probably . I don't really know how to use this phone yet . __eou__ do you want to listen to your messages first ? __eou__ no , it's ok . Check your email first ; I'll check my unbox later . __eou__ I'm surprised you don't use more of the features on your phone . __eou__ I'm surprised you know so much about it . Where's your phone ? __eou__ it quit working last week and I haven't had a chance to buy a new one yet . __eou__ how have you been living without a cell phone for a week ? hasn't it been driving you carry being without a phone ? __eou__ it's not that bad . It kind of feels like I'm on vacation , not having to answer my phone all the time ! __eou__ let's go shopping . You can't depend on public phones in this day and age ! __eou__
Are you feeling better today , Bill ? __eou__ Well , it ’ s hard to say . I coughed a lot in the evening . __eou__ You ’ d better give up smoking . It ’ s bad for your health . __eou__ You ’ re right . But you know it ’ s so hard to give up the old habit like smoking . __eou__ But you should make up your mind first . __eou__ You know I often have to work far into the night . I need smoking to keep me awake . __eou__ Why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? You ’ ll have the same time for work . __eou__ Thank you for your advice . I ’ ll try it . __eou__
What are your weekend arrangements ? __eou__ There're many things I can do on weekends . __eou__ What sort of things are you interested in ? __eou__ I'm keen on talking short trips to nearby scenic spots .

In the afternoon , I just ride my bike around the city or along the country roads for almost two hours . __eou__ That's great ! I think they do you a lot of good .

Are you going to Helen ’ s birthday party on Friday evening ? __eou__ I wouldn ’ t miss it for the world ! It ’ s sure to be fun . She ’ s invited a lot of people . Do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ? __eou__ If everyone turned up , it would be a squeeze , but a few people said that they couldn ’ t go , so I think it should be ok ? __eou__ Are you taking anything ? __eou__ I ’ Ve got her a birthday present and I ’ ll take a bottle fo wine too . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . She told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . I think it ’ s going to be a noisy party . I hope her neighbours don ’ t mind too much . __eou__ Helen gets on very well with her neighbours .

You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party . __eou__ Well , yes , but those people always start talking to me . I never talk to them first . Perhaps I ’ m not as shy as I think . Anyway , you ’ re certainly not shy ! __eou__ You ’ re right . I love going out and making new friends . __eou__ So , you ’ ll be at my birthday party on Friday ? __eou__ Of course ! __eou__

What do you think are the most important things to do when running a business ? __eou__ Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high . __eou__ So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ? __eou__ No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs . __eou__ How can a business maximise revenues ? __eou__ You need to invest in some good advertising . You have to know where your potential customers are and target them . It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . The market is too small . __eou__ What else do you suggest ? __eou__ Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . Price yourself near the low end . Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . They think that is must be poor quality if it ’ s that cheap . __eou__

Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield , but , oath , it ’ s out of bounds . __eou__ That will be a throw in for Brazil . Adriano has the ball and makes a long pass to Robin , and the ref has called him offside . __eou__ No question about it . He was offside by a mile ! We have a goal kick for Ecuador . Edison Mendez heads it to Valencia , he shoots ! Deflected by the defender and we have a corner kick . __eou__ Delgado takes the corner . We have a foul ! Oh no , Did , the goalkeeper , has fouled the Ecuadorian player ! He gets a yellow card and that will be a penalty kick ! __eou__ This is the perfect opportunity for Ecuador to get ahead in this match and become World Champions ! He gets ready for the kick .

I could get along fine without all the office politics . __eou__ What's going on ? __eou__ There is a position I've had my eye on for several months now and I had good reason to believe that it was mine for the asking . __eou__ So what happened ? __eou__ We were awarded government funding last year and in order to keep it we have to hire so Ay new employees . __eou__ So what does that have to do with this position ? __eou__ Someone in the main office has a nephew who he thinks can slide right into the Management position I wanted . __eou__ All under the precept of keeping the funding ? That stinks . __eou__

What are you reading ? __eou__ It ’ s an article about language . It talks about the idea of having a single global language . __eou__ It seems that English already is the main global language . Does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like Esperanto as the world language . __eou__ Actually , it suggest English .

I would never be able to do that . __eou__ Yeah , it was scary , but exhilarating . __eou__

The weather is really miserable . It has been raining hard all day long . __eou__ Yes , it's so cold . __eou__ Do you think the rain is going to let up soon ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . The rainy season will be over soon . __eou__ How long does the rainy season last ? __eou__ About two months . __eou__ I can hardly stand these wet and cold days .

Would you like to go skating with me this afternoon ? __eou__ Oh , I'd love to . But we're going to clean our dormitory . I can't be absent . __eou__ Maybe another time . People say that boys ' dormitories are in a mess , is it true ? __eou__ In fact , our dormitory is much worse than they can be described . __eou__ It's hard for me to imagine . How can you stand that ? __eou__ You'll get used to it gradually . __eou__ Oh my God , don't you know that such living environment is not healthy ? __eou__ Yes , we do . That's why we have a cleaning every three months . __eou__ Three months ? Incredible ! __eou__

Are you excited about your trip next month ? __eou__ Yes and no . I can ' t wait to go to Europe , but at the same time I am terrified . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Well , I have acrophobia . I have a chronic fear of flying . __eou__ Oh really ? I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying . It ' s not that bad though , I mean , it is pretty scary to be in this big machine flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour . I actually have arachnophobia . __eou__ You ' re scared of spiders ? I actually have two more phobias . Acrophobia and glossophobia . __eou__ I guess that explains why you are afraid of flying , but public speaking is not that bad . __eou__ Are you kidding ? When I get on stage , my palms start to sweat , I get really nervous and I can hardly speak . __eou__ Well , I must confess I am a bit claustrophobic . I hate being in an elevator for more than 5 seconds . __eou__ We are such weirdos right ? __eou__

Would you like to come to our party ? __eou__ I'd like to . But I'm not myself today . __eou__ what happened ? You look so pale . __eou__ It's the end of the world for me . __eou__ What makes you say that ? __eou__ Today , I'm told I failed three courses . __eou__ Oh , that's too bad . Work harder next term . __eou__ I'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste of time to me . __eou__ Don't loose heart . Everything will be fine . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__
I had a terrible journey back from Bangkok last week . __eou__ Really ? Why ? What happened ? __eou__ Well , first of all , the taxi that was taking me from the client's office to the airport broke down on the freeway . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ Yes , and the driver didn't speak any English or Chinese and he didn't have a phone on him-can you believe it ? - and his radio didn't work . So there was no way he could get in touch with the office to get them to send another taxi . __eou__ So what did you do ? __eou__ Well , I actually thumbed a lift . __eou__ You what ? __eou__ Yes , I stood on the side of the freeway and stuck my thumb out , and a passing truck stopped and took me to the airport . __eou__ Wow , good for you . __eou__ Yes , except he drove really slowly , and I missed my flight . __eou__ Oh , no ! __eou__ Yes , so I had to wait three hours for the next one . I didn't get home till four in the morning , and when I got home I realized I'd left my house keys in my hotel in Bangkok . __eou__ You really have bad luck , don't you ? __eou__ Seems like it . __eou__
Do you have change for a hundred ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__
Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ? __eou__ Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers . __eou__ Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ? __eou__ Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion . __eou__ I didn ’ t pay attention to that . __eou__
Do you know about All Fools ' Day ? __eou__ On that day , people play all kinds of tricks on others , and the one easily taken in is called April fool . __eou__ April fool ! __eou__ April the first is coming.Be careful ! __eou__
Daniel , I can't catch up with the English teacher very well . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ You are quite good at English , can you help me with it . __eou__ That's OK . But you'd better take an additional course in some English schools . __eou__ English school ? What is that ? __eou__ This kind of school is good at helping people to improve their English . __eou__ Is that different from our school's English course ? __eou__ Yes , before you start your training , they will test you on your English first . __eou__
Have you ever seen coco ? __eou__ I've seen her on TV but not in the flesh . __eou__ I'm so familiar with her songs , but I don't know what kind of person she is in real life . __eou__
Joseph , who is that woman ? __eou__ That's Susan . __eou__ What does she do for work ? __eou__ She's a lawyer . __eou__ Is she American ? __eou__ No , but she speaks English fluently . __eou__ She's really tall . Do you know her ? __eou__ Yes , I know her . We're friends . __eou__ Who's that man standing next to her ? __eou__ Which man ? __eou__ That short guy on her right . What's his name ? __eou__ Oh , that's Matt . __eou__ He's really good looking . __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Do you know him ? __eou__ I don't know him , but I think my sister does . __eou__ Is he married ? __eou__ Yes , he's married . __eou__ I remember now . I met him before . __eou__
I ’ Ve gotta hand it to you , you really did a good job ! __eou__ So glad that you think so ! __eou__ I think you deserve a promotion . __eou__ Oh , really ? Thanks a lot ... well , I still have a lot to learn , I guess . __eou__
Are you going abroad to study ? __eou__ I'll have to think about it . __eou__
Billy , you are late again . __eou__ I'm sorry I'm late . I overslept . Is the manager here today ? __eou__ Yes he ' s in his office . __eou__ Oh , I hope he didn't notice me . __eou__ Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you . __eou__ You said it . It won't happen again . Do you really think he'd fire me ? __eou__ I think he might . You'd better go to his office . __eou__ You are probably right . I'll go right now and apologize . I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic . __eou__ Good luck ! __eou__
Sam , what shall I do with my stocks ? Will I lose money ? __eou__ There ’ s a possibility . __eou__ What do you mean by that ? __eou__ I mean if you don ’ t sell your shares now , it ’ s quite likely that you ’ ll end up losing your shirt . __eou__ Is that so ? __eou__ Absolutely . Take my word for it . __eou__
Ann invited us to dinner this saturday afternoon . __eou__ What should we take ? __eou__ How about a china vase ? __eou__ Good idea ! __eou__
Which of the two do you think is better ? I mean , what's the difference between them ? __eou__ Well ... this one costs more , but it has a much better sound.This part of it is made of wood , not plastic . And there's a tone control , too . __eou__ I only want it for the kitchen . I like to listen to the news at breakfast time . __eou__ Hmm ... well , the other one is good for the money . It's much cheaper . We sell clot of them and all our customers are satisfied with them . __eou__ Hmm ... I'd like the cheaper one , please . Can I pay hy cheque ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__
Did you have a good weekend ? __eou__ Yes , thanks . Did you ? __eou__ Not bad . What did you do ? __eou__ I went to Tamshui . You ? __eou__ I wasn't feeling too well , so I stayed at home . __eou__
What do you do for a living ? __eou__ I ’ m a doctor . __eou__ Really ? Do you like it ? __eou__ Yes , I do . It ’ s very interesting . What ’ s your job ? __eou__ I ’ m a bus driver . __eou__ Oh , do you enjoy it ? __eou__ No , I don ’ t really like it . It ’ s boring . __eou__
I'm sorry , Sam . I don't want to go to the folk concert . __eou__ How about going to the theatre ? __eou__ I don't like going to the theatre . __eou__ Well , what do you like doing ? __eou__ Travelling , swimming , going to the cinema . And you ? __eou__ I like painting , sailing , watching football and talking to you . __eou__ I like talking to you , too . __eou__ Do you want to go to an exhibition ? There is one at the Xinghai Exhibition Hall tomorrow . __eou__ That's a good idea . __eou__
You want to go to the movies tonight ? __eou__ Sure ! What ' s playing ? __eou__ The new Twilight movie ! __eou__ Twilight ? As in the vampire movies ? No way , I am watching that , but I don ' t understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires . It doesn ' t make sense . __eou__ Of course it does . It ' s like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet . You can see a couple who are in love but can ' t be together because they are so different . And in the fact that immortality and super human strengthen this really sexy and there you have it ! Plus the cast is hip , young people that make the movie even more enticing . __eou__ I don ' t buy into that . I think it ' s just a fad . Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into wear-wolves or zombies ! __eou__
What kind of person do you consider yourself to be ? __eou__ I think I'm polite , careful , relaxed and shy . __eou__ Oh , I don't think you're shy ! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party . __eou__ Well . Yes , but those people always start talking to me . I never talk to them first . Perhaps I'm not as shy as I think .

Let's invite Bobbie and John to our party , OK ? __eou__ You can never do that . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ There's been bad blood between them since Bobbie took away John's girlfriend . __eou__
You look really wiped out ? __eou__ I had meetings back to back all morning . And phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office . __eou__ Not a good day . I hate to tell you that Mr . Thomas wants to see the profit ’ s statement for new project tomorrow morning . __eou__ I can ’ t believe it . I guess I ’ ll be here until 10 again tonight . __eou__
Is this a photo of your family ? __eou__ Yes , it is.It was taken just before I was leaving for college . __eou__ You look so lovely . __eou__ How time flies ! I'll not see twenty again . __eou__
Can you speak Japanese ? __eou__ Yes , I can , but not very well . __eou__ Where did you learn it ? __eou__ At school . And I'm still learning it now . __eou__ How long have you been learning it ? __eou__ About three years . __eou__ Can you speak any other languages ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . __eou__
Mary , do you remember when we met ? __eou__ I won't ever forget it ! I was sitting in the cafeteria all by myself ... __eou__ And I came up and asked to sit by you ... __eou__ Oh , it seems like it was just yesterday . __eou__
May , we are fools to hang out at noon . It's dying hot today . My skin is too weak to be exposed under the summer sun . __eou__ Do you have any sunscreen lotion ? __eou__ You know , honey , I used it all on the way over . __eou__ I think I'm getting a heart stroke . __eou__ The heat is driving crazy and I hate my new hat . __eou__ Why ? It's brand new , and it's perfect on you . __eou__ But I bought it to get rid of the heat . Now it does nothing but burning my head . __eou__ Beauty costs , honey . __eou__ Laugh all you want , whatever . We need to get out of the heat . __eou__ Walking under the sun is certainly not the way . __eou__ Give me a break . It's not funny . __eou__ Right . Sorry . Anyway , the radio said that it'll rain later today . __eou__ Hope so ! Good thing is that autumn is just around the corner . __eou__
Do you know much about computers ? __eou__ Not a great deal . __eou__ I've just been reading an article about them . They'll be used for all sorts of things now . __eou__ For accounting system and things like that , you mean ? __eou__ Yes , but they are used for other things , too . Do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to Paris . __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ The man asked where we want to go , then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply . A few moment later , he gave us two tickets . __eou__ Of course , his machine must have been connected to a computer . __eou__ That's right . __eou__
It ’ s time for me to go now . __eou__ Would you like me to go with you ? __eou__ I ’ d rather you stayed in the office and did these things . __eou__ Do you want to type that letter ? __eou__ I ’ d rather you typed it . __eou__ Do you want to tell her ? __eou__ I ’ d rather you told her . __eou__
Which season do you like best ? __eou__ I like spring . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Oh , everything comes back to life in spring and the weather gets warmer . __eou__ I like spring , too.We can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air . __eou__
John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ? __eou__ Poor fellow ! What's the date today , buddy ? __eou__ It's ... OH , it's the first of April , April Fools ' Day . __eou__ You forgot all about it , didn't you ? __eou__
I've booked an air ticket to Venice . __eou__ How long will you be there ? __eou__ I'd like to stay there for a week . __eou__ So you'll have a tour of the famous city . __eou__ Certainly . __eou__
Oh , the ink is spilled on the desk . __eou__ Did it spill on your clothes ? __eou__ No , but the table cloth was dirty . __eou__ That's OK . __eou__ I'm afraid it's too hard to wash off the stain . __eou__ It's no big deal . __eou__ I really feel great shame . Let me buy a new one for you . __eou__ Don't be silly , forget about it . __eou__
Are you a happy married man ? __eou__ Yes , I am . My wife and I understand each other . __eou__ You are a lucky man . How about Mr . Smith . __eou__ I don't know . But they say that Mrs . Smith wears the pants in the house . __eou__ You mean she bosses her husband around ? __eou__ That's right . She is pretty , but she wants to control everything in his life . __eou__
The country is strong only in appearance . Don ’ t you think so ? __eou__ Yes . In fact there are quite a large number of people who have no food to eat and no place to live in . __eou__ You can say that again . The government must open it ’ s eyes to the fact . __eou__
Elaine ’ s back from school . I think it might be a nice gesture if you asked her out . I suppose she ’ s not good enough for you , is that it ? __eou__ Look , Elaine Robinson and I do not get along . __eou__ How do you know ? You haven ’ t seen her since high school . I guess your evenings , whatever you do with them , are just too valuable . __eou__ That has nothing to do with it ... __eou__ I guess I ’ ll just have to tell Mr . Robinson that you ’ re too busy every evening – doing God knows what ... God don ’ t go on like this . If you absolutely refuse to take her out ... __eou__ I do . __eou__ Then I will simply have to invite all the Robinson ’ s over for dinner on Thursday . __eou__
It smells like an ashtray in here ! __eou__ Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ? __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking . __eou__ No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight ! __eou__ Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before . __eou__ I know , I know . I am really trying , but I don ’ t have the willpower to just quit . I can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ? __eou__ Fine ! I want a divorce ! __eou__
Jack , could you check your calendar ? __eou__ Sure , what's going on ? __eou__ We're planning a weekend camping trip , and we want to know which weekend is best for everyone . __eou__ Let me see ... The weekend after next looks pretty good.Otherwise , I'm all booked up . __eou__

What's wrong , Dave ? You look down today . __eou__ I didn't pass the English exam . How to learn English well ? Can you give me some suggestions ? __eou__ Well , English is a " paper tiger " . Its natural enemy is adequate practice . __eou__ I have done a lot of reading comprehension exercises , and I also spend much time in memorizing English words . __eou__ I suggest you read English texts aloud every day , and try to speak more . That will be beneficial to cultivate your sense of the language . __eou__ Really ? I'll have a try . Maybe I will get high marks next time . __eou__
The answer for number 6 is C , 7 is B , 8 is A ... __eou__ Ms . Lee , could you tell me what number 7 is again ? I didn't catch you . __eou__ Sure . 7 is B . Any others ? __eou__ No , thank you . __eou__
Look ! That man who is baking bread is so handsome . __eou__ Watch his bread , it seems to be delicious . He had a lot on the ball . __eou__ Oh , my god ! He ’ s so perfect . __eou__
I don't know what I'm going to do . I need to find a job . If I don't , I won't be able to stay here next semester . __eou__ Have you tried university part-time jobs ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I mean in the library , or in some information center.Often the university hires foreign students for part-time positions . __eou__ Yes , I know . I tried that.They don't have anything now . So what can I do ? __eou__ Well , since you're a foreign student , it's hard.That ' s because it's actually illegal for you to work in America . __eou__ I know that . You don't have to tell me that . That's my problem . I know I have the right to work for the university . That's legal.But they don't have a job for me . And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere . __eou__ Anyway , there must be some solution.You know there are many people working illegally in New York . __eou__ But I need a pretty decent job . I need to make enough to pay my rent at least . __eou__ I have an idea . __eou__ What ? __eou__ Since you're Chinese , maybe you can find part-time work in Chinatown . __eou__ I already had that idea . __eou__ Well , why don't you go and look down there ? __eou__ But I don't know what I would do . __eou__ It may be part-time work as a waitress or something.It would be illegal , but sometimes waitresses make a good salary . __eou__ Maybe . I don't know . __eou__ I will ask my friends for you.Maybe someone knows a company that needs part-time people.That ' s another thing you should do . Ask all your friends to ask around for you.You might find something . __eou__ I have to find something.Otherwise I have to go back to Taiwan . I'll be broke in two months . __eou__
I have some photos here taken by myself . Would you like to see them ? __eou__ Sure . Speaking of photos , what type of film will be the best ? You know , I'm planning a tour to Jiuzhaigou Valley . __eou__ I would get Fuji 200 film for taking photos of natural beauty . __eou__ Thank you so much . You're an expert . __eou__
Excuse me , Professor , is there a time when I could meet with you ? __eou__ I could meet with you tomorrow anywhere from two until four ; what time works out best ? __eou__ I would like to come in at three o'clock . __eou__ I am glad that that works out ; can you find my office ? __eou__ Yes , I can . __eou__ Just follow the walkway to the outside and climb the stairs to the third floor . __eou__ I got it . __eou__ If you do get lost , just ask someone in the building to point the way . __eou__ Thank you , I'll be there . __eou__ If you need to cancel your appointment , please give me a call ! __eou__

We drank everything in the bar ! __eou__ Is that why you missed work today ? __eou__ Yeah . I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous . I threw up like five times . __eou__ Www ! __eou__ I was so dehydrated that I drank like a gallon of water , and my head has been pounding all day . I swear , I ’ m never gonna drink again ! __eou__ Too bad man , tonight is Tracy ’ s going away party and she asked if you were gonna go . __eou__ Oh , yeah . I ’ m there ! __eou__
Hey Claire , you've been really quiet these last few days . Is something wrong ? __eou__ I've been really stressed . It's the end of the year and I've got so much stuff to do ! I feel like I'm drowning in work . __eou__ Well , stress is a real thing . It's not an imaginary condition . __eou__ It's seriously affecting my life ! I can't sleep , I don't have much of an appetite and my husband says I've been kind of short tempered . Other people seem to handle stress okay ... why am I so weak ? __eou__ You're not weak ... you're stressed out ! Stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years . Back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators ... and as you might imagine , that was pretty stressful . __eou__ Yeah , but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office . My stress is just about silly paperwork ! __eou__ But you're actually having the same reaction as our tree-dwelling ancestors ! It's called the flight or fight response . Each time you feel like something's threatening you , your body decides whether to run away or fight ... it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body . __eou__ So a deadline will cause that same reaction ? __eou__ It could . Modern humans actually have more flight or fight responses than our ancestors did . They just had a couple of close calls every day , but today , we have dozens or even hundreds ! __eou__ So the life of a cave woman was less stressful than my life ? __eou__
Hey , Mary , what's up ? __eou__ Not much . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight . __eou__ Oh , that's exciting . What's this guy like ? Is he hot ? __eou__ Well , I ddin't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! We have so much in common . We like the same teams , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . __eou__ It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? __eou__ There's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have a radar helping me spot new friends . __eou__ Well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you ask me what I value most in a friend , I would have to say honesty . __eou__ I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . __eou__ Yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . __eou__
I must be going now . __eou__ Really ? Can't you stay a little longer ? __eou__ No , I really must go now.My family are expecting me home soon . __eou__ Be seeing you then ! __eou__ See you ! __eou__
When you are in a restaurant you want the waiter to bring the bill , what do you do to attract his attention ? __eou__ I just make eye contact with him and nod my head . Then I tell him when he comes over to the table . Why do you ask ? __eou__ I went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and I noticed that many people shouted for the bill . __eou__ That seems a little impolite in such a restaurant . __eou__ That ’ s what I thought . I just thought I ’ d ask you and see what you thought of it . Anyway , what did you do yesterday evening ? __eou__ Well , it was a warm evening , so I stretched my legs . I walked along the canal for a couple of miles . Actually , several other people had the same idea . I saw Bill . __eou__ Did you ? How is he these days ? __eou__ He seemed ok . We didn ’ t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . We just waved at each other . __eou__ I need to move some furniture . Could you help me to lift it ? __eou__ Of course . What do you want to move first ? __eou__ Let ’ s move the sofa . Can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? I ’ ll lift this end . I want to move it sideways in that direction . __eou__
Guess what ? __eou__ What ? __eou__
I don't like this movie . It's a bomb . __eou__ Look , I've already paid for the tickets , so whether you like it or not we're going to finish watching it . __eou__ Well , give me the Walkman . I'll listen to the music then . __eou__ Come on . Give it a chance . The movie just started . __eou__
Excuse me , Miss . __eou__ Yes . May I help you ? __eou__ I'm a graduate student here in mathematics . I've just come from China and I've never used a western library before . I'll be here for five years , so I'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . I wonder if someone might have time to show me around . __eou__ I'd be very glad to show you around , but I'm very busy right now . Could you come back about 3 thirty ? __eou__ Sure . 3 thirty this afternoon . __eou__ Good . See you later . __eou__ Thank you . Good-bye . __eou__
Don't open any of my forwards ! I got a virus ! __eou__ Don't tell me you got the dreaded Bush virus . I've heard that that bug is threatening to infect the world . __eou__ Yes , that's exactly the bug I got . Though , I do kind of like the pictures . __eou__ Those clothes do suit him better . __eou__ Wait a second-are these pictures copyrighted ? __eou__ Probably not . It's off the Internet . What difference does it make ? __eou__
Say , do you go to see your grandparents often ? __eou__ Of course , my grandpa is generous and kind.My grandma cooks the most delicious Chinese dishes in the world . __eou__ You are very lucky . __eou__
I need some flowers for my girlfriend . __eou__ No problem . Would you like some artificial carnations ? __eou__ Oh , no . Carnations are not very elegant.Artificial flowers have no passion . __eou__ How much did you want to spend ? __eou__ Money is no object . __eou__ Our most elegant flower is Golden Lily . __eou__ I will take ten . __eou__ Do you want to add some baby ’ s breath for that ? They are equally popular now . __eou__ Of course . Can I have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon ? __eou__ Yes , but there is a five dollars delivery charge . __eou__ That's ok . Here is the address . __eou__
Julie , what's on the tube ? __eou__ nothing but bench of commercials . These days the amount of commercials is amazing . __eou__ yeah . Maybe we can change to another channel . what about the sports channel ? Let's see if there's a game on . __eou__ okay . Nope , it's a replay of yesterday's soccer match between Brazil and Spain . __eou__ it was a good game , but not good enough to watch again . Keep surfing . __eou__ alright . Hmm , this movie is a rerun ... I don't know how many times I've seen this show ... Commercial again ... and a replay of the talk show ... oh no , this show is terrible , you don't wanna watch it . __eou__ oh , what is it ? __eou__ it's a total rip-off of an American reality show , but the imitation is unbearably clumsy . __eou__ oh , I know this kind of shows . Sometimes they really piss me off . If I wanted reality , I'd go outside . __eou__ yeah ... it seems what we have on TV now are either repeats , or commercials , or low-quality shows . There's really nothing to watch . __eou__ I don't get it . We have more than 100 channels and there's still nothing good on ! Maybe we should just turn off the TV , get outside , and do something real . __eou__ cool . __eou__
That woman is a thorough drag ! __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ She keeps spitting on the ground . __eou__ Maybe there's something wrong with her . __eou__
To be a revolutionary needs great courage ! __eou__ He must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities . __eou__ Galileo is one of them . __eou__ So are Copernicus and many others . __eou__
Did you go to the bank to withdraw money ? __eou__ Today is so hot , besides I had so much housework to do . My friend came for a visit and stayed for two hours . I didn ’ t forget , but I had no time at all . __eou__ So you didn ’ t . Is that right ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ m sorry . __eou__ Why didn ’ t you just answer my question directly ? Why would Chinese answer questions this way ? I simply asked if you did it or not . It ’ s a very simple question . And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer . __eou__ Yes , I ’ m sorry . I know it bothers you very much . But I don ’ t know why Chinese sometimes would do this . __eou__ You know , today I asked a student if he brought his dictionary with him . It ’ s a rule I made for the class that everyone brings a bilingual dictionary with them because sometimes they don ’ t understand me . The funniest thing is that this student gave me a lot of reasons and no direct answer . __eou__ But you know if he brought it or not , right ? __eou__ Yeah , after all the explanations like , it ’ s too heavy , I was in a hurry ... whatever . __eou__
Uncle , have a heart , please lend your new car to me . Only once . __eou__ Where are you going ? __eou__ I have a big date tonight . __eou__ You have got a car , haven ’ t you ? __eou__ Oh , please . Only once lend your new car to me . __eou__
Betty and I will throw a dinner party this weekend , we ’ d like you to come . __eou__ That would be very nice . Only that I ’ ll be a little late . Is that OK ? __eou__ Sure . We ’ ll be looking forward to that day . __eou__ So will I . Thank you . __eou__
I think it's going to be a nice day . __eou__ It's certainly a big improvement over yesterday . __eou__ But it'supposed to get cloudy and windy again this afternoon . __eou__ Well , the worst of the winter should be over . __eou__
David , I heard you lost your job . __eou__ Yeah , you remember that assignment I wanted ? When I heard the manager had given it to someone else , I blew my top . So the manager fired me . __eou__ Well , that'll teach you to control your temper . __eou__
You look very professional in the suit . __eou__ The company regulates that men should wear a suit and tie in business meeting . Company policy is not negotiable . __eou__ I appreciate it . It is related to company image . __eou__
Do you know Mark ? __eou__ Yeah ! He is a nice guy . He is very helpful and always bends over backward to help those who are in need of help . __eou__ Can you introduce him to me ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__
Did you tip the bellboy ? __eou__ Yes , but I don ’ t think it was enough . He looked disappointed . I gave him three dollars . __eou__ That sounds about right to me , fifty cents a bag . If they think you don ’ t know better , they ’ ll try to get more . __eou__ It ’ s the same in Balloon . But I definitely think we over-tipped the cab driver . The fare was twenty dollars , and you gave him a five-dollar tip . That ’ s twenty-five percent of the total ! Too much ! __eou__ I disagree . He was polite and informative , and he drove smoothly . One should reward good service . __eou__ I ’ ll sign for dinner and charge it to our room.Let ’ s see.The bill is one hundred dollars . That seems reasonable . How much tip should I leave ? __eou__ Remember last month when we were in Europe ? Maybe Californians use that same system they add the waiter or waitress into the bill , so you don ’ t have to leave anything extra . __eou__
Thomas , would you be so kind as to lay the table for me ? I'm busy in the kitchen . __eou__ Of course ! Where are the things ? __eou__ They're all here . __eou__ Right ! I'll do it straight away . __eou__ Thanks a lot . I'm most grateful . __eou__
William told you that his grandmother is sick , huh ? What exactly did he say ? __eou__ He said his grandmother got cancer and has only a few weeks to live . It's really so sad ! But when I talked to him on the phone , it sounded like he was holding up really well . __eou__ It didn't sound like he was too upset , huh ? What did you tell him ? __eou__ I asked if there was anything I could do to help his family , and I told him that I could be a shoulder for him to cry on . __eou__ Well I hate to tell you this Jen , but both of William's grandmothers passed away more than five years ago . __eou__
The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ? __eou__ No idea . Your guess is as good as mine . __eou__ It better be more than last year . __eou__ Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see . __eou__
Do you like to dance ? __eou__ Sometimes , if there's music playing . __eou__ What kind of dancing do you like ? __eou__ It all depends . If it's rock music I'll do disco , and if it's romantic music I'll do ballet . __eou__
Mom , what are you doing ? __eou__ I'm clipping coupons . __eou__ Still clipping coupons ? __eou__ It's a good way to save money . __eou__ Saving money ? How much money can you save by those 1 or 2 dollar discount coupons ? __eou__ How much ? Last week I save $ 10 on food . __eou__
Sorry ! Excuse me ! I got your message . __eou__ Taylor ? Taylor ! Is this a joke ? Is it really you ? But ... but ... everyone said you were dead ! __eou__ That's OK . Just let it out . I'm OK ! I was out of town with ... Femi . __eou__ Oh , Taylor ! I'm so ... so happy . But then ... who's that ? __eou__ Taylor Smith . But not me . The pallbearers are carrying out the casket . It would be rude to just leave . Let's follow . __eou__
Okay , next question . If Eric asked you out on a date , what would you say ? __eou__ Duh ! I would say yes ! Eric is the most popular kid in school ! Okay , my turn . What would you do if you won the lottery ? __eou__ Let ’ s see ... If I won the lottery , I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world . __eou__ If you buy me a ticket I will go with you for sure ! __eou__ My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that ! __eou__ Alright this is a good one . What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married ? __eou__ If I told her that , she would faint and have me committed ! __eou__
Wow , there are so many lanterns to appreciate . __eou__ Now . you can see why it's called the Lantern Festival . __eou__ Yes , it deserves its name . __eou__ Did you notice the characters on the lanterns ? __eou__ Sure . But you know that I can't read any Chinese characters . What do they say ? __eou__ They are puzzles . It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival . __eou__ It's interesting and I want to buy one home . __eou__
Do you have s second ? __eou__ Sure . What do you want ? __eou__ I want to tell you I've put in my notice . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ I've been thinking about this for several months , well before the Spring Festival holidays . __eou__ And the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision ? __eou__ Yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received a pay rise . It's unfair . __eou__ Absolutely . With your expertise and experience , you're clearly working below your pay grade . __eou__ That's exactly why I decided to quit the job and find a new one . __eou__
Hi Joe . You met my new assistant , right ? __eou__ Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up . __eou__ You are kidding , but she's so helpful . __eou__ Tom ... you are her boss , you down . Of course , she's helpful to you . __eou__ Come on . She's like that with everyone . __eou__ I don't think so actually . She never even says " hello " to me . __eou__
What a boring film ! __eou__ The acting of the heroine is too artificial . __eou__ And the plot is so simple . __eou__
So , John , what do you do for a living ? __eou__ I ’ m a sales manager in a publishing company . __eou__ Oh , really ? That sounds interesting , what kinds of book do you publish ? __eou__ Oh , mostly fiction , lots of romance , science fiction , biography , stuff like that . __eou__ Oh , What a cool job ! How long have you worked there ? __eou__ About two years now . __eou__
Are you planning on studying abroad ? __eou__ I'd like to , but I'm not sure if I'll have enough money . __eou__
I feel pity for the old man . __eou__ I feel the same way . __eou__ It must be dreadful to grow old . __eou__ It sure is.He has no one to turn to , very miserable indeed . __eou__
Dad , you keep talking about family in New Zealand . Who are they ? __eou__ Well , that's your uncle Bill , his wife and two of their daughters . __eou__ Is uncle Bill your brother ? __eou__ No , your uncle Jack is my brother , Bill is my brother-in-law , your mom's brother . __eou__ So his two daughters are my cousins ? __eou__ That's right , Sarah and Jane are both your cousins although they are step-sisters . __eou__ What are step-sisters ? __eou__ Sarah is your uncle Bill's older daughter . When she was young , Bill's first wife , Sarah's mom died . Three years later Bill married again . __eou__ So uncle Bill's wife is Jane's mother but not Sarah's mother . Right ? __eou__ Yes . She is Sarah's step-mother . __eou__ And when are they coming to visit us ? __eou__ They want to travel to Europe next year , and will visit us at the same Ae . __eou__
I'm worried sick that she will leave me tomorrow . __eou__ It's no use arguing the toss . __eou__ Maybe I'll have to face the music . __eou__
I like pop music very much . __eou__ What ? __eou__ I said I like pop music very much.It ' s so lovely . __eou__ Is it ? __eou__
I'll help you , Lucy . Look at what I've got here . In this small bottle , there's a magic love potion . __eou__ A magic love potion ? __eou__ Yes . If you put a few drops on someone's eyelids while he's asleep , he'll fall in love with the first person he sees when he wakes up . __eou__ It can't be true . __eou__ Take my word for it . __eou__ So what am I going to do ? __eou__ Just come to our house and stay over . You'll sit by his bed and greet him like a beautiful red rose , ' Good morning ! ' __eou__ That sounds like a blue rose ! My sitting by his bed ? __eou__ Don't be so shy , Lucy . __eou__
All right , let's see who's ruining my TV time . __eou__ What are you going to do ? Call my boss and chew him out ? __eou__ Is your boss named Vic ? Your pager says , This is Vic . Here I come ! __eou__ Impossible . My pager is really old . It doesn't display messages . __eou__ Here , see for yourself . That's really strange ! It's almost the same as when I ... __eou__ Gosh , you're right ! It's from some guy named Vic . I wonder who he is ... __eou__
I'd like to say good-bye to everyone . __eou__ What time are you going ? __eou__ My plane leaves at seven twenty-five . __eou__ Well , good-bye and have a good trip ! __eou__ Good-bye . Remember to look me up if you're ever in Washington . __eou__
Well , what brings you here ? __eou__ I came to see my aunt . __eou__ Does she live nearby ? __eou__ Yes . She lives on the next block . __eou__
Don't talk too much , Tom . We are on duty today , we should hurry up . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Tom , your task is to clean the blackboard . __eou__ How about yourself ? __eou__ I'm going to sweep the floor first . __eou__ Daniel , I am not tall enough to reach the of the blackboard . __eou__ Stand on the chair , Pig Tom . Use your brain . __eou__ OK , I've finished cleaning the blackboard . __eou__ How about the podium ? __eou__ Oh , I forgot about it . I'll get it . __eou__ Be quick , please . Our teacher and classmates will come soon . __eou__ I will be done before they come . __eou__
I think he deserved his gold . __eou__ Did you see his last dive . __eou__ Yes , it's perfect ! __eou__ He's diving for the gold . __eou__
Jim , I heard you took a trip to San Diego . Is that right ? __eou__ Yeah , I just got back this morning . __eou__ That sounds really nice . What did you do there ? __eou__ Well , we were only there for three days , so we didn't do too much . We went shopping and went out to dinner a few times . And at night we walked around the city with some friends . __eou__ Did you take any pictures ? __eou__ Yes , I have them with me . Do you want to look at them ? __eou__ Sure , I love looking at photos . __eou__ This one is of my wife and me on the beach , and this one is our daughter Emily standing next to my wife . __eou__ Your daughter looks like her mother . __eou__ I know , they look very similar . __eou__ Where was this picture taken ? __eou__ That was taken at the train station before we left . __eou__ Did you have time to go to the zoo ? __eou__ No , not this time . We went there last time . __eou__ It looks like you all had a nice time . __eou__ Yeah , it was a lot of fun . __eou__
Are you interested in history ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . __eou__ I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened . __eou__ I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks ! __eou__ Some people say that history repeats itself . __eou__ What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ? __eou__ The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same . __eou__ I see . I think I ’ d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again . __eou__
Nice day today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , beautiful weather we're having . __eou__ We can't complain about the weather recently . __eou__ Yes , the sun shines day after day . It's neither too hot nor too cold . __eou__ I wonder how long this weather can last . __eou__ I hope it will last fine Sorrow . I'm going to have a picnic with my family . __eou__
Excuse me , Sir , May I have the time , please ? __eou__ Beg your pardon ? __eou__ Er ... I'd like to know what time it is now . __eou__ Oh , Let me see ... It's three forty-five . Er ... wait , My watch is five minutes fast . So it should be three forty __eou__ Thank you . By the way , what day is today ? __eou__ Today is Friday . Are you new in Beijing ? __eou__ Yes , I've just come from the States , yesterday in fact . I'm still a bit confused about the time . __eou__ Welcome to Beijing . This is my business card . I'm an engineer . If you need any help in Beijing , just give me a call . __eou__ Oh , that's very nice of you . I don't want to sound pushy , but I still l have one more question . __eou__ Go ahead . __eou__ What's the date today ? __eou__ It's October the 1st , our National Day . I'd like to talk some more , but I've got to get going now . It was nice talking to you , though . __eou__ Yeah , it was nice to meet you . Hope I run into you again sometime . __eou__
I really enjoyed that film ! What about you ? __eou__ So did I . At first , I thought it was going to be boring , but then it turned to be good . __eou__ What part of the film do you like best ? __eou__ Well , the scene of the hero's struggle with enemies impressed me the most . __eou__ I loved it , too . To tell you the truth , I even dropped tears . __eou__ Actually , tears also came to my eyes . __eou__ It has got this year's Oscar Award . __eou__ It deserves it . The film gave us a lot of inspiration . __eou__
I just got a letter from an old high school buddy . __eou__ Really ? That's nice . __eou__ He usually keeps me posted . __eou__ I've been completely out of touch with my old friends . __eou__ It's hard to keep up contact when people move around so much . __eou__ Yes , people just seem to drift apart . __eou__
What did you think of the film ? __eou__ I liked it . I thought it was great . __eou__ Yes , I liked it , too . Did you like the acting ? __eou__ Yes . I thought it was excellent . Didn't you ? __eou__ Not really . I thought it was disappointing . __eou__ It's a nice cinema , isn't it ? __eou__ Do you think so ? I don't like it very much . I found it rather uncomfortable . __eou__
John's very late.Do you think he's coming ? __eou__ Well , it doesn't seem like it.He must have forgotten . __eou__ I suppose you're right.He can't have remembered . __eou__
I don ’ t know why bucks have such a great charm that a great many people are after nothing else . __eou__ They want to be filthy with dough and think it the only source of their happiness . __eou__ But many rich guys don ’ t think they are truly happy . There is always some empty feeling deep inside them . __eou__
What are you using for bait today ? __eou__ We are fishing with worms . The fish seem to like them . __eou__ Is that so ? We're using lures , and the fish are biting those too . __eou__ Looks like a lucky day for everyone . __eou__
How is your ankle ? __eou__ My what ? Oh , that , right as a trivet . __eou__ Please be careful next time . __eou__ I will , thank you . __eou__
Do you know something about Mount Tai ? __eou__ Yes . But not too much . It is considered as the head of five sacred mountains in China . __eou__ Five sacred mountains ? Why people call them so ? __eou__ Because in history , the Chinese emperors used to climb onto these mountains and pay tribute to their ancestors and pray for good harvest and prosperity for the whole nation . __eou__ Got it . Can we see any things left by them ? __eou__ Definitely . There are many wall paintings and inscriptions on the huge rocks on the mountain . __eou__ I want to see them . How can I go there ? __eou__ That is easy . You can go directly to Tai'an city and buy a ticket to Mount Tai . __eou__
Mary , this is your homeroom . It's 213 . Remember that . __eou__ What's a homeroom ? __eou__ You sit in there , listen to the morning announcement with other kids , and then you go to your classes . __eou__ Cindy , I'm scared . __eou__ But I have to go to my homeroom . __eou__ Do we have the same classes today ? __eou__ No . __eou__ Do you think the school can put us in the same homeroom ? __eou__ Stop worrying , Mary . You'll do just fine . __eou__
Helen , you must be excited at going to America to study . __eou__ Yeah , I've been looking forward to it for ages . __eou__ What do your classmates think of it ? __eou__ They give me a lot of congratulations . __eou__ How long will you study there . __eou__ Oh , maybe three years . I will study and get the master degree first . Then I will decide whether I will stay there or come back . __eou__ Which university will you go to ? __eou__ Chicago University . My major is Economics . __eou__ Good luck ! __eou__ Thank you ! __eou__
Look ! Someone is celebrating his birthday . __eou__ This must be his 21st birthday . No doubt about it . __eou__ Why ? Do you know that guy ? __eou__ No . Well , in America , 21 is the age when you're allowed to drink . So , many guys celebrate it in bars . __eou__ That's interesting . But it would be really expensive , I suppose . Just think about all the drinks . __eou__ No . If it's your birthday , then you don't need to pay a cent . Just blow out the candles and open the gifts . That makes the birthday a special day . Your friends will take care of everything . __eou__ Wow . That's wonderful . __eou__ What about in China ? What'd you do to celebrate your birthday ? __eou__ Nowadays , it's no difference from America . But in old times , we have traditional ways to celebrate it . __eou__
have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ? __eou__ yeah , almost . But there is one thing . __eou__ what ? __eou__ I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ... __eou__ what is it ? __eou__ some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others . __eou__ that makes you feel uncomfortable ? __eou__ yeah . we never do that in a public office . __eou__ perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy . __eou__ i have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding . __eou__ well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus . __eou__ just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ? __eou__ yeah . __eou__ Oh , I'm shocked . __eou__
Excuse me , Miss . __eou__ Yes . May I help you ? __eou__ I'm a graduate student here in mathematics . I've just come from China and I've never used a western library before . I'll be here for five years , so I'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . I wonder if someone might have time to show me around . __eou__ I'd be very glad to show you around , but I'm very busy right now.Could you come back about 3,30 ? __eou__ Sure . 3:30 this afternoon . __eou__ Good . See you later . __eou__ Thank you . Good-bye . __eou__
what's your apartment like ? __eou__ it's furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus . __eou__ what is it like living in on-campus housing ? __eou__ it's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it . __eou__ did you have to pay a deposit ? __eou__ no , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month . __eou__ do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ? __eou__ no , it's all included . Besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here . __eou__ how long is your contract for ? __eou__ that's the bad thing---the contract ends in June , so we'll have to find a new apartment soon . __eou__ have you started looking again yet ? __eou__ not yet . I'm hoping we'll be able to find something cheap once all the students leave the city for the summer . __eou__ Good luck ! __eou__
Have you seen the news that there is a serious flood in the South ? __eou__ Yes . I've got to cancel my traveling plan . __eou__ What a pity ! I know you've been longing for it these months . __eou__ The only thing I can do now is waiting for another chance . __eou__
You should have seen the T . V . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights . __eou__ Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights . __eou__ Yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings . __eou__ I understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . If so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala . __eou__ You can ’ t compare apples and oranges . I believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching . __eou__ Well , you are right on that point . This is the reason that I don ’ t buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products . __eou__ As long as you don ’ t treat it better than your wife , it ’ s fine . __eou__
Excuse me . May I take a picture of you and your little boy ? __eou__ What ’ s it for ? __eou__ It ’ s for a book . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s a nice idea . Well , it ’ s fine if you take our picture . __eou__ Thank you . I appreciate your help . __eou__
Just dab it all over your face and then take a look at the symbols that appear . __eou__ Yeah ... hearts , stars and some weird looking things . __eou__ Those are money bags , and they represent your financial situation . __eou__ So decode this for me , Madame Psycho . __eou__ That's Madame Psychic to you . __eou__ I'm waiting ... __eou__ Well , you have three hearts — lucky in love tonight . Dress up and go on a date ! __eou__
Mary , how was your date with john ? __eou__ it's ok . It seems we have a lot in common . __eou__ oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ? __eou__ he is tall and slim , fair-haired . __eou__ sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? __eou__ he is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . __eou__
Did you go to the concert last weekend ? __eou__ No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ? __eou__ Yes , I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist . __eou__ How much was the ticket ? __eou__ I only paid two dollars for mine . __eou__
Hi , nice to hear from you , when does your plane leave ? __eou__ It leaves in 20 minutes . __eou__ Good . __eou__ Can you pick me up from the airport ? __eou__
Will you help me take these things to the car ? __eou__ OK , which car do you want me to put them in ? __eou__ Bring them to my wife's car . __eou__ Which one is hers ? __eou__ The blue SUV in front of the Honda . __eou__ What should I take first ? __eou__ That chair over there , but please be careful with it . It was a gift from my mother-in-law . __eou__ Don't worry , I won't drop it . Wow , it's really heavy . I don't think I can move it by myself . __eou__ Let me help you with that . I don't want you to hurt your back . __eou__ Where are you taking all this stuff ? __eou__ Didn't I tell you ? We're moving to Florida ? __eou__ You're moving now ? I knew you were moving , but I thought you said you were moving next month . __eou__ Yes , that's true , but my wife found a new apartment on the Internet the other day and she wants to move right away . __eou__
Have you received your TOWEL test results yet ? __eou__ Yes , I did . I passed ! __eou__ Congratulations ! I knew you could do it . __eou__ Well , I certainly couldn't have done it without your help . You are the best tutor I've ever had . __eou__ Thank you , but it was your hard work that did it . __eou__ You deserve credit , too . I've learned so much from You . __eou__
You didn't come to work yesterday.What happened ? __eou__ I had to look after my son at home . __eou__ What's wrong with him ? __eou__ He has a fever . __eou__ Is he getting better now ? __eou__ I think so.Thank you . __eou__
It sure is hot today . __eou__ That's for sure . I feel like I'm melting . __eou__
how's it going ? __eou__ I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ? __eou__ to be honest , I'm a bit fed up . __eou__ what's wrong ? __eou__ there's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around . __eou__ I see ! Do you want to ask her out ? __eou__ sure , but how ? __eou__ you can ask her out for drink after work . __eou__ but for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am . __eou__ then you've got a lot of homework to do . You need to get her notice first . __eou__ easier said than done . __eou__ you can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her . __eou__ but I always get tongue-tied when I see her . __eou__ that's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased . __eou__ I see . I'll try . __eou__ good luck ! __eou__
It's getting late . I'm afraid I have to leave.Thank you for a most wonderful evening . __eou__ Don't mention it.Don ' t forget to take your daughter along next time . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Lisa , would you like to go to the library with me ? __eou__ OK . Do you think we can go buy a newspaper first ? __eou__ Sure . First we'll go buy a newspaper and then we'll go to the library . __eou__ Are we going to walk or drive ? __eou__ The weather is really nice today . Let's walk . __eou__ The weather is good now , but I think it's suppose to rain this afternoon . __eou__ Alright , then let's take an umbrella . Is your brother coming with us ? __eou__ No , he's still sleeping . __eou__ Wow , it's already 10:00 AM . He must have been up late last night . __eou__ Yeah , he didn't come home until 12:00 AM . __eou__ I hope he can come later . __eou__ I hope so too . I'll give him a call when we get there . __eou__ How do we get to the library from here ? __eou__ It's straight down this road on the left , next to the museum . It takes about 10 minutes . __eou__
Hi , Lucy , you are very popular with people around you , what are your tricks ? __eou__ Thank you for saying so . I don ’ t know , probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues . __eou__ Sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances . People may think you are telling them how to do their work . If they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work . __eou__ That is true . Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off . __eou__ You are quite right . Thank you for sharing your experience with me . I learned a lot . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
how was your education going on in Australia ? __eou__ I'm going to graduate this summer . __eou__ where are you going to work then , in Australia or back in China ? __eou__ I'm planning to return to China after graduation . __eou__ why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad . __eou__ well , I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment . __eou__ yeah , China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country . __eou__ absolutely , many Chinese enterprises are going global , and they are in great need of excellent returnees to help them with their overseas business . __eou__ the rapidly expanding economy has encouraged many students to pack their bags AMD head for home . __eou__ that's right . Most of the Chinese students pursuing higher education in Australia intend to return to China . __eou__
How do you like this dress ? __eou__ It's nice . But what kind of dress are you looking for ? __eou__ Something attractive and dressy . Maybe a little sexy too . New Year's Eve is a special occasion and it only happens once a year , right ? __eou__ Of course . It's common too that we wear something special for our Chinese New Year . __eou__ People here always wear the best clothes they have . Many people go out and buy clothes especially for New Year's Eve . __eou__ Any other common customs of your New Year ? __eou__ Before the New Year , we always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year . On the street and in stores people usually greet others with a ' Happy New Year ' . It's also common for people to make a New Year's resolution . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ It's when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do . Many people resolve to quit smoking , lose weight , or stop nagging their wife , etc . However , it usually lasts only for a few days ! __eou__ By the way , where are you going on New Year's Eve ? __eou__ We're going to a night club for dinner and dancing , then we'll go down to the city square for the big celebration . There's always a fireworks display put on by the local government . We all want you to come too . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__
My name's McDonald . __eou__ Is that spelt M , A , C or M , C ? __eou__ It's M , C , capital D . __eou__
Hey , you wanna see a movie tomorrow ? __eou__ Sounds like a good plan . What do you want to see ? __eou__ How about Legally Blonde . __eou__ Ah , my girlfriend wanted to see that movie . I have to take her later so I don't want to watch it ahead of time . How about The Cube ? __eou__ Isn't that a scary movie ? __eou__ How scary can it be ? Come on , it'll be fun . __eou__ Ok . I'll give it a try . __eou__ That's the spirit . I'll see you tomorrow after class . __eou__ Ok . See you tomorrow . __eou__
Could you help me to register for a class ? __eou__ Do you know what class you want to take ? __eou__ Are there any Psychology classes available ? __eou__ I believe there are still two Psychology classes open . __eou__ On what days are the classes ? __eou__ There is one class on Tuesday and Thursday from 2 to 4 . __eou__ Can you tell me about the other class ? __eou__ It's from 10-12 on Monday and Wednesday . __eou__ You're positive that these are the only classes left ? __eou__ These two are the only ones . __eou__ The class on Monday and Wednesday will be fine . __eou__ Very good . __eou__

Though he must be quite young , he seem like an old person . He ’ s so boring ! __eou__ That ’ s too bad . How was your English teacher ? __eou__ She was great . In today ’ s class , she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student . She told us not to arm for exams , and to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing . __eou__ Where is she from ? __eou__ She said that she ’ s from a small town in the middle of America . __eou__ Were you able to understand everything that she said ? __eou__ Not everything , but nearly . She speaks very clearly and doesn ’ t use very complex words so that it is easy for us to understand her . __eou__ She sounds like a good teacher . Do you think you ’ ll pass her class ? __eou__ Yes ... with flying colors ! __eou__ What does that mean ? __eou__ It ’ s a new phrase that she taught us today . It means that I will not only pass the class , but I will do extremely well ! __eou__ If you like the class this much already , I ’ m sure you will . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__ did she give you any homework ? __eou__ not today . She said she wanted us to relax tonight instead of doing homework , __eou__ no wonder you like the class so much . __eou__
I know you're sleepy and I hate to bother you , but I think you're late for work . __eou__ Oh , no . I forgot to turn the alarm clock on ! __eou__ Don't worry . I can give you a lift . __eou__ Thank you . You save me . __eou__

Last summer , I fell in love with John . But the romance blossomed for six or seven weeks , and then wilted . __eou__ One love drives out another . You shouldn't be afraid to start a new relationship . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__
How's work ? __eou__ The same as usual . __eou__
The police need our help finding a robber . __eou__ How do you know ? __eou__ The TV news is reporting a bank robbery . __eou__ Do they know what the robber looks like ? __eou__ Yes , he's 6 feet tall , 200 pounds , black hair , and about 30 years old . __eou__ What race is he ? __eou__ They didn't say . __eou__ The TV news doesn't tell us the race anymore . __eou__ Of course not . That would be racist . __eou__ But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race ? __eou__ Don't ask me . __eou__ Then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female , because that is sexist . __eou__
What are the pop groups that you like ? __eou__ Oh , there are so many good ones ! I loved the Spice Girls . They were so cool ! __eou__ I agree ! I cried for a week when they broke up . __eou__ I was really sad too , but at least I can still listen to their Cds . __eou__
David , imagine meeting you here ! __eou__ Janice , I found you stole my vegetables at four o'clock this morning . Is that true ? __eou__ All right !

I wanna register for this mathematics course . __eou__ I ’ m sorry registration has closed . __eou__ Closed ? The clerk told me I could come back and register any time during the first week of classes . __eou__ Well , that ’ s not possible . The computer ’ s official student account has already been sent to the state . And that ’ s what our budget is based on . Who told you that anyway ? __eou__ Some woman in here when I tried to register three weeks ago . She said I just had to pay a late fee . __eou__ She must have been a part-time worker . They didn ’ t have much training . Why didn ’ t you register then ? __eou__ She said I couldn ’ t until I had my birth certificate . Here it is . __eou__ Huh , that is no reason to demand a birth certificate . We only need to establish residency , you know , a phone bill with your name and address on it would have been fine . __eou__ Serious ? Only the proof of my address . __eou__ Yes , I am afraid she gave you the wrong information . __eou__ But it ’ s unfair . __eou__ Well , I sympathize with your problem , but , to be honest , I don ’ t think there is any thing anyone can do for you . You were trapped in the system.If you want , you can talk to the director . She will help you if she can . __eou__ Great . __eou__ Don ’ t get your hopes up . __eou__

You can stay there for at least a whole day . __eou__ That's a good idea . I almost forget it.What else ? __eou__ The night life there . It's so romantic ! __eou__ Oh , wonderful ! How is the weather ? __eou__ I went there in August , and it was hot . But I was told autumn is the best season . __eou__ Sounds exciting . I can't wait . __eou__
This shirt you gave me is not my favorite brand . __eou__ Don't look a gift horse in the mouth ! That was the best they had . __eou__

The southeast , the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . There are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country . __eou__ Yes , there are . They are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries . __eou__ The coast of your country is very varied . The coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches . __eou__ That doesn ’ t sound too bad . Great for sunbathing ! The coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . There are cliffs , then sandy beaches . Then rocks . There are lots of caves in the cliffs . __eou__ There are many lakes and rivers in your country too . We also have many rivers , but only a few lakes . __eou__ We also have waterfalls in the mountains . They make the landscapes look very scenic . The landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion , especially by water . __eou__

I don ’ t understand why you always look so happy , so energetic . It seems like you ’ Ve got good news everyday . __eou__ Really ? Do I look happy all the time ? __eou__ All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers . __eou__ Oh , do you know why ? Actually , it ’ s easy . Because I always exercise .

I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus and some students trying to imitate you . __eou__ Yeah , they are doing it for fun . Seldom would people like my exercise . It ’ s difficult and boring . __eou__ It ’ s true . Many students do the exercise when they have to . We have P . E . once a week . __eou__ But I think Chinese students need to exercise more . Besides exercise will help them learn new things better . Don ’ t students want to have a good memory ? __eou__ Of course . I didn ’ t know that . I only know exercise makes bodies stronger . I should take some exercise then . Do you have any suggestions ? __eou__ Well , do what you like to do . It can be anything . Jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong .

Now , let's start our lesson . __eou__
How was your job at the state-owned enterprise ? __eou__ Oh , I no longer work there . I'm working with a multi-national corporation . __eou__ You changed jobs again ? Why do you move so frequently ? __eou__ I want to try different things before I find the one I really like . __eou__ Why don't you stick with one job for a bit longer ? __eou__ I could handle everything pretty well in the old position , so I decided to move around and learn something new . __eou__ How's your current job going ? __eou__ I'm pretty satisfied with it . I can broaden my experience , learn lots of new things , and have more development opportunities . __eou__
Do you have a boyfriend ? __eou__ Yes . Why ? __eou__ Well , I came to know a girl 3 weeks ago and we have so much in common . __eou__ So ? __eou__ So I think I may fall in love with her . __eou__ You are attracted to her . That sounds great , but how do you know that it is a crush or it's real love ? __eou__ Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in love ? __eou__ That's a big question . Well , if you are in love , maybe you ’ ll take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all . __eou__ That's what I did . __eou__ And you think about her all the time ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ And maybe you suddenly have new interests . I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid , ie.You used to sleep in every morning , but because she jogs every morning , then you begin to like jogging . __eou__ That's it . She likes dogs so much now , and I begin to love dogs . __eou__ Oh , congratulations ! Sounds like you ’ Ve found your soul mate . __eou__ Thanks . But I know falling in love is one thing , while staying in love is another . __eou__ Yeah , that's right . If you find this person is more and more important to you and you can totally trust her , then you can stay in love . __eou__ Yeah . Falling in love is so good ! __eou__ While staying in love is even better . __eou__
If you wanna keep healthy , you must give up smoking . It's extremely bad for your health , you know . __eou__ I know it's not good for me , but the problem is I just can't help it . __eou__ Well , I've got an idea , put the label cancer sticks on each pack of cigarettes , and read it before you smoke . It may give you a feeling to reduce it . __eou__ I'll try . __eou__
What happened ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ Let's stop and have a look . __eou__ Don't waste time . __eou__ I'm curious about that . __eou__ But it's none of our business . __eou__
It ’ s very kind of you to invite me to dinner . __eou__ Please sit down and make yourself at home . Please don ’ t stand on ceremony . __eou__ This dish is really delicious . __eou__ I ’ m glad that you like it . This is only the first time that I made it . __eou__ You ’ re great . Could you say it in Chinese ? __eou__ Sure , we call it doubt . __eou__
Wake up , Erik , time to rise and shine . __eou__ Huh , oh , hi , Jane . I must have fallen asleep while I was reading . __eou__ You and everyone else . It looks more like a camp-ground than a library . __eou__ Well , the dorm ’ s too noisy to study in , and I guess this place is too quiet . __eou__ Have you had any luck finding a topic for your paper ? __eou__ No . Prof . Grant told us to write about anything in cultural anthropology . For once I wish she hadn ’ t given us so much of a choice . __eou__ Well , why not write about the ancient civilizations of Mexico . You seem to be interested in that part of the world . __eou__ I am , but there is too much material to cover . I ’ ll be writing forever , and Grant only wants five to seven pages . __eou__ So they limit it to one region of Mexico . Say the Yucatan . You ’ Ve been there and you said it ’ s got lots of interesting relics . __eou__ That ’ s not a bad idea . I brought many plenty of books and things back with me last summer . That would be great resource material . Now if I can only remember where I put them . __eou__
I really like my debate class . __eou__ Do you think you'll be interested in studying law later ? __eou__ I've entertained the idea . But I'm I leaning more toward politics . __eou__ You want to be a politician ? Yuck . __eou__ That's not like you to generalize . __eou__ Sorry , you're right . I think you'll be a good politician . __eou__ I think I can do a lot of good for our country . __eou__ You're right . We need more people like you in politics . __eou__
I dare you to talk to that girl . __eou__ Okay , I will . __eou__
Hey , what's the matter ? __eou__ It doesn't matter . I just feel a little dizzy . __eou__ Are you sure that this has nothing to do with sleep ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__
Excuse me . My name is David Walker . Haven't we met before ? __eou__ Well , let me see ... Do you work at IBM Corporation ? __eou__ Yes , I do . __eou__ Now I remember . We met at a conference in Tokyo last year . __eou__
The last thing I want to see is to lose face before my friends . __eou__ That ’ s really unbearable . __eou__ But you know , things cannot always go as you expect . __eou__ So get prepared for everything . __eou__
Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ? __eou__ My husband and I have thought about it , but we ’ Ve decided not to have any . They are just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of world we ’ ll have in the future . What about you ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ? __eou__ For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn ’ t ever have to share . __eou__ Don ’ t you think you would miss having other people around ? __eou__ No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . you know , I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ’ home . What do you think of the one-child policy in China ? __eou__ If China didn ’ t have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ? __eou__ That ’ s true . But as a woman , I ’ m glad that even though I don ’ t want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can ’ t imagine what China would be like if there weren ’ t a one-child policy ! __eou__ Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ? __eou__ I don ’ t know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children ! __eou__
I'm sorry I'm late . __eou__ Oh , that's all right . I just wondered what was keeping you . __eou__ The bus I took . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I took the wrong bus . __eou__ Oh , did you ? That's very easy to do . __eou__
Hi , Anna . I haven ’ t seen you for ages . Where have you been ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been away on holidays for sometime . __eou__ No wonder I haven ’ t seen you recently . Where did you spend your holidays ? __eou__ I went with my husband . Our first stop was Bangkok . We stayed there for 5 days . Then we flew to Hong Kong , stopover for 3 days . Our last stop was China . We visited the Great Wall . __eou__ You must have a wonderful time . __eou__ Yes . We enjoyed ourselves very much . Have you traveled much , Luke ? __eou__ No , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . We haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . We spent our honeymoon in the Alps . __eou__
I think I need a new notebook ... __eou__ Why ? Is there some new , cool computer out on the market ? __eou__ You bet there is . Feast your eyes on this puppy ! __eou__ That's a notebook ? __eou__ Believe it ! __eou__ It looks more like a toy , or a cool briefcase ! __eou__
Is there a lot of crime in your city ? __eou__ There ’ s some , but I don ’ t think it ’ s a big problem . A lot of it is petty crime , burglary and car theft . There ’ s very little major crime . __eou__ It ’ s the same in my city . We also have a lot of drug addicts . A lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs . __eou__ That happens in many places . In my city , there is a very good drug rehabilitation programme . The police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes , but I don ’ t know if that ’ s the reason for __eou__ Some people believe that a tough approach is better . Other prefer a more lenient approach . __eou__ I think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . If most people have similar amounts of money , they will not think of stealing from others . __eou__ That ’ s possible , but I ’ m not sure it would really happen like that . __eou__
Why do you like this computer ? __eou__ It's user friendly . __eou__
What can I do for you today ? __eou__ I need to return a book . __eou__ Can I do anything else for you ? __eou__ I would also like to check out this video . __eou__ Is that all ? __eou__ Yes , just the video . __eou__ May I see your library card ? __eou__ Here you go . __eou__ You have to take care of this video . __eou__ Oh , I will . __eou__ You will be fined if you damage it . __eou__ I understand . Thank you very much . __eou__
Good game ? __eou__ Not bad . But too hot for me today . __eou__ Yes , I know . Kind of hard to concentrate , isn't it ? __eou__ Absolutely . Who were you playing with ? __eou__ Oh , just on my own . I just joined , so I don't really have any partners . __eou__ Really ? Oh , well , in that case we should play together some time . What's your handicap ? __eou__ 16 . Yours ? __eou__ No kidding ! I'm 16 , too . We should definitely play together some time . My name's Bob . __eou__ Jane . Nice to meet you . __eou__ Me too . So , do you like the course ? __eou__ Yes , it's fine . However , I personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long , especially for such a hot climate . Don't they have carts ? __eou__ Well , they used to , but they got rid of them because of environmental concerns . __eou__ Oh , that's good . I guess the caddies were pleased . __eou__ Actually , in my opinion , the carts were better because you don't have to tip them . __eou__ Yes , but look at it this way , getting rid of the carts probably gives more work to local people , which is a good thing , right ? __eou__ Possibly , but I still miss them ! What bothers me is that the heat makes the caddies ' life quite hard . One member's caddy fainted last week ! __eou__ How awful , poor guy . __eou__ Right . Luckily it was on the eighteen hole , quite near the clubhouse , so he didn't have far to carry him . __eou__ Oh , my God , you're kidding me ! He carried him back ? __eou__ Yup . __eou__
Can I get you something to drink ? __eou__ No , that's okay , I already have a coke.Why don't you have a seat , you look like you've been on your feet all day . __eou__ I guess I could take a break.So , how do you like Denver ? __eou__ It's great ! The mountains here are beautiful and the skiing is spectacular.Have you been here for a long time ? __eou__ About six years ... __eou__ What do you do for a living ? __eou__ I manage one of the ski lodges.It ' s a great job , I can spend a lot of my time outdoors , and I also get to ski for free all season . __eou__ Wow , talk about job perks ! That's great . I would like to do something exciting like that.But I am only an accountant.Not too much excitement there.huh ? __eou__ That's okay.If it weren't for you accountants , nobody would have the money to go skiing ! __eou__
What are you doing ? __eou__ I ’ m just looking at this map of the world . I ’ m preparing for a geography class . __eou__ There are no countries marked on the map . __eou__ No , there aren ’ t . this map just show the geographical features . Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world . __eou__ The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water . Compared to the oceans , most countries are tiny . __eou__ I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall . __eou__ Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand can you . __eou__ The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate . __eou__ It ’ s all so interesting . I ’ ll have to find more information about it on the internet . Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class . __eou__
I'm sorry , I'm having a little trouble understanding your accent . __eou__ I'll try to speak more clearly . __eou__
What's your favourite steps ? __eou__ It's hard to say . But I do love waltz very much . __eou__ How about rumba ? __eou__ To tell the truth , I don't like it . __eou__ Really ? You must like tango , right ? __eou__ Oh , it's really beautiful , but I just can't dance it well . __eou__ Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can dance it very well . Let's dance it now . __eou__ OK . I'll have a try . __eou__ Oh , you dance it so well . __eou__ Thank you for your compliment . __eou__ I think I'm your lucky fellow . __eou__
I heard many stories about your brother . __eou__ He's a hero in our town . __eou__ What does he look like ? Is he handsome ? __eou__ Yes , indeed , People say he's the smartest young man . __eou__
Do you know that Jack got divorced last month . __eou__ For what reason . __eou__ Jack always lives by his wits and he cannot support his family . __eou__ He had better make a change . __eou__
Why do you look so sad ? __eou__ I ’ m in pretty bad shape . I am having an allergy all the time . __eou__ Why not go and see a doctor ? __eou__ I never trust those stupid doctors . __eou__
I'll always remember my college days . __eou__ oh yeah ? __eou__ It was one of the best times in my life . It was tough , but I made it . I became a college graduate . __eou__ how did you feel when you graduated ? __eou__ it was a round day for me . My family attend the graduation ceremony . I was so nervous . I couldn't find my cap and gown , but all worked out in the end . __eou__ what did you do after graduation ? __eou__ I was planning to attend gradate school , but then I was offered a good job doing marketing , so I changed my mind . __eou__ sounds like you're happy with your decision . __eou__ I sure am . So what about you ? How did you feel when you graduated ? __eou__ it was also a proud day for me , but I also felt like a kind of loss that day . __eou__ how could it be ? __eou__ while seeing others going to work or continue their study , I didn't know what I would do . __eou__ you didn't have an offer ? __eou__ I had one , but I didn't like the job very much . I wanted to attend graduate school , but I was afraid it would be too tough . __eou__ I think you lack in the power of decision . Once you make your decision , don't be overtaken by misgivings and fear . Just go full steam ahead ! __eou__
Ashley , what a great dinner party ! __eou__ Thank you , Joe . What would you like to drink with your meal ? I can offer you wine , mango juice , or water . __eou__ Just water would be fine . __eou__ Excellent choice . Can I dish you up some chicken ? __eou__ Yes , the chicken looks wonderful ! __eou__ How about some salad to go with your chicken ? __eou__ Sure , I love salad ! __eou__ Would you like to have rice with your chicken ? __eou__ Yes , I think that rice will go perfectly with my chicken ! __eou__ Good ! Julie , if you could pass this plate down to Joe , I think we are all set . __eou__
How many days do you take off for Easter ? __eou__ Usually we have a month off . __eou__ What will you do for this Easter ? __eou__ I'll stay at home and have a complete rest . __eou__
Mary didn't pass the final exam in physics . __eou__ She must be very sad . __eou__ Her parents scolded her severely and she's very depressed now . __eou__ At a time like this , what she needs is a pat on the back rather than a blame . __eou__
John dates her seven times a week . __eou__ Really ? That's a straws in the wind . __eou__ I think so . Maybe he's fallen for her . __eou__ Yeah . They suit each other . A perfect match between a man and a girl . __eou__
My uncle gave me this bicycle as a birthday present . Look ! __eou__ So cool ! Can I get a load of it ? __eou__

Is it white gold or silver ? __eou__ It's white gold . __eou__ Where did you buy it ? __eou__ My boyfriend took me to the Shane Co . and he let me pick it out . __eou__ That's so sweet . What was the occasion ? __eou__ That's the best part . It wasn't for anything special . He just wanted to buy me something . __eou__ You're so lucky . If he bought you something for no special day , I wonder what he would buy you for your birthday . __eou__ My birthday is coming up . We'll find out pretty soon . __eou__ What do you want ? __eou__ I wouldn't mind a necklace . I was at the jewelry shop looking around , and they have a couple of beautiful necklaces I want . __eou__ Why not a ring ? __eou__ I don't think I'm ready for a ring from him yet . __eou__ But you're ready for everything else ? __eou__ Akha . __eou__
Do you like traveling , Kathy ? __eou__ I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... __eou__ Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__

The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa __eou__ I have no idea what you ’ re talking about . The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl . __eou__ This is bigger than the Super Bowl , man ! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . They first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each g __eou__ Sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me . __eou__ Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will bec __eou__ All I know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me ! __eou__ Whatever , I ’ m going to go watch the opening match . __eou__
Do you often do exercise ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ OK , and what kind of sports do you usually play ? __eou__ I often play badminton with my parents . __eou__ You ? Play badminton ? That's unbelievable ! You are shorter than a racket . __eou__ Hey , I'm good at playing it . __eou__ Says who ? __eou__ My parents . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__ How about you , Daniel ? __eou__ I'm a real man , and I like football . __eou__ Well , who is your favorite football player ? __eou__ I like Renaldo the most . __eou__

Do you know where that is ? __eou__ No , I don't know where that is . __eou__ The office is in front of you as you cross the quad . The signs in the hallway will tell you where you need to be . __eou__ I think I can find it . __eou__ You'll find it easily . Make sure you add the class and then we will look at the roll sheet later to make sure that you were added on . __eou__ Thank you for letting me add your class . __eou__ To drop a class , you need to do the same thing with a drop slip . Good luck ! __eou__

What's the weather like in your city ? __eou__ In the summer it gets very hot . The temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . When it is hot we often get rains . The winters are drier . __eou__ The summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 or25 in my city . The rain falls mostly in the winter . And we often get snow . __eou__ What are the temperatures in winter ? In my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees . __eou__ In winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . The streets are often icing in the morning . With high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms . __eou__ Yeah , we do . In the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon .

But my parents and I never see it outside of my city . __eou__ The river in my city sometime freeze over . People go ice-skating on it . In summer people go boating on the river . But few people go swimming because it is not very clean . __eou__ As you know , my city is on the coast.the water is also not clean . But people still go swimming all year around . I prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning . __eou__
Look ! It's clearing up . __eou__ I can see the sun now . __eou__ I like summer as long as it's bright like this . __eou__ Anyway , I dislike summer here.There ' s too much rainfall . __eou__

Well , no one could survive without water , but you see pollution has been making more and more water unable for drinking . __eou__ Yeah . Water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues . __eou__ But what are the sources of water pollution ? __eou__ They could generally be divided into two categories __eou__ Well , direct ones are the pollution directly from factories , refineries waste treatment plants etc . , aren ’ t they ? __eou__ Yeah . They are emitted directly into urban water supplies . __eou__ But what about the indirect ones ? __eou__ Indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater . __eou__ I see . For the sake of us all , we should be an active participator in the prevention of it . __eou__ Sure . It's an issue asking for everyone's participation . __eou__

Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall . There are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . You have to be very careful and keep you computer clean . __eou__ How often do you run your anti-virus program ? __eou__ I usually run it every few days . It finds a virus about half the time . __eou__ Which anti-virus program would you recommend ? __eou__ How you tried this one ? It ’ s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . You can also download updates for free . __eou__ That sounds very good . Which website should I visit to download it ? __eou__ Just a minute ... go to this one . I ’ ll send you an email with the line in it . It only takes a few minutes to download . Then you have to go through the set up procedures . But they are not complicated . __eou__ What do you use your computer for ? __eou__ I use it for several things-surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . I don ’ t play many games on my computer , but I do a lot of work with photographs . Using c computer program , you can edit and resize photographs . You can also make them brighter or darker and cut pieces from different photographs to create new ones . __eou__ Computers are great , aren ’ t they ? I should download some program and learn how to use them . __eou__

Take it easy and say something to me if you like . __eou__ Oh , buddy , you are so kind . Thank you ! __eou__ Not at all ! __eou__

They are a nice middle-aged couple , just like us . __eou__ If they are just like us , they are not middle-aged . __eou__ Of course they are . __eou__ Middle-aged means in the middle , Ethel , middle of life . People don't live to a hundred and fifty . __eou__ Oh , we are the part on the edge of middle . That's all . __eou__ Oh , you know , we are not middle-aged . You're old , and I'm aging . __eou__ Oh , fool ! You're nearly seventy and I'm in the low sixties . Would you like to spend the rest of the afternoon squabbling about this ? __eou__ I can if you like . __eou__
How should we commemorate the centenary of the founding of the university ? We have been given quite a large budget to pay for some events . __eou__ We should certainly hold a big party for the professors and students . We could have a firework display . __eou__ Do you think that we should invite alumni and former professors ? __eou__ If we do , too many people might attend . Perhaps we should invited all of them , but make a small charge to attend . __eou__ Good idea . We should also hold a series of presentations . We could have presentations on the history of the university , the courses we offer , and our links with other universities . __eou__ Good idea ! I think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives . __eou__ We could have another on the successes of graduates from here . __eou__ I think that we could also produce some merchandise for the centenary-you know , T-shirts , mugs , plates , pens , and things like that . __eou__ That ’ s an excellent idea . Hopefully , we would be able to make a profit ! A few professors and students are writing a book on the history of the university . __eou__ I ’ m looking forward to reading that . We could have book signings by famous professors an alumni . __eou__ A group of students from the art and music faculty are producing a short film . __eou__ I ’ m sure that will be very popular .. OK , let ’ s think about how we can put these ideas into practice . __eou__
Your knowledge of English is really surprising . __eou__ Oh , it's nothing to speak of . __eou__ No , seriously . I'm impressed . __eou__ Thank you . I appreciate the compliment . __eou__
What's your name ? __eou__ My name is Sam . __eou__ How are you , Sam ? __eou__ I'm fine . Thank you . __eou__ Where are you from , Sam ? __eou__ I'm from England . __eou__ What is your job ? __eou__ I'm a bank manager . __eou__
Excuse me , are you Miss Green ? __eou__ Yes . May I help you ? __eou__ May I introduce myself ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I ’ m a new student in the school . My name ’ s John . __eou__ Nice to meet you , John . __eou__ It ’ s a pleasure to meet you , Miss Green . __eou__
Have you considered upgrading your system ? __eou__ Yes , but I'm not sure what exactly I would need . __eou__ You could consider adding a painting program to your software . It would allow you to make up your own flyers and banners for advertising . __eou__ That would be a definite bonus . __eou__ You might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now . __eou__ How can we do that ? __eou__ You'd probably need a faster processor , to begin with . And you also need a more powerful hard disc , more memory and a faster modem . Do you have a CD-ROM drive ? __eou__ No . __eou__ Then you might want to add a CD-ROM drive too , because most new software programs are coming out on Cds . __eou__ That sounds great . Thanks . __eou__
Hoo , I'm getting tired , Jeanine , been a long day . __eou__ I'm not quitting yet . You know my favourite slogan , don't you ? __eou__ Yeah , I know . Shop till you drop . __eou__ Right ! __eou__ I'm getting a little short on cash . Let's just window shop a little . __eou__ Ok . __eou__ Hey , Jeanine , get a load of that . It's beautiful . __eou__ Ahahah , and I thought you were tired . __eou__ You know .. I have a weakness for long dresses . __eou__ It sure looks special , looks expensive too . __eou__ Sure does . Hey , can I sponge a little cash of you ? __eou__ Don't worry , Mary , I've got you covered . __eou__ Thanks , Jeanine , you are a real pal . Let's go in . __eou__
Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it . __eou__ Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know . Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more . __eou__ But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished . __eou__ But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely . __eou__ Well , only you liked it really , darling . __eou__ Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy . __eou__
I am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ? __eou__ Well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . There are so many good choices . __eou__ The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun . I just don ’ t know what to do first . __eou__ Why not start with the most interesting one ? __eou__ Actually , I ’ m interested in all of them . The more choices we have , the harder to make a decision . __eou__ Toss a coin to decide then . __eou__
There is too much traffic in Taipei these days , I think cars should be banned . __eou__ I'm not sure about that . How would people get to work ? __eou__ Well , why not use buses or the MET ? __eou__ Well , it may not be that simple . Not everyone likes public transport . __eou__ Why not ? There is nothing wrong with our buses and trains . __eou__ Well , I don't often use them , I wouldn't really know . __eou__
I want to try my hand at the stocks . __eou__ It is very hard , you know . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . I know there are no pennies from heaven . I will work hard . __eou__ Good luck ! __eou__
What do you think of the new mayor ? __eou__ No comment . __eou__
Hello , is this People's Theater ? __eou__ Yes , it is . May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , are advance tickets for ' Nut croakers ' still available ? __eou__ What date , sir ? __eou__ October 16th . __eou__ Let me see . Yes , we still have some tickets left . Which performance ? __eou__ 7:30 p . m . performance , please . __eou__ OK , we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan . __eou__ I'd like to reserve two seats at 100 yuan , please . __eou__ All right . May I have you name , please ? __eou__ Du Kun . __eou__ When would you like to collect the tickets ? __eou__ Tomorrow . __eou__ We can hold them until one day before the show . __eou__ How do we cancel , just in case ? __eou__ Just telephone us , and let us know in advance . We don't charge for cancellation . __eou__ All right , thank you very much . Good bye . __eou__ You are welcome . Goodbye . __eou__
Excuse me . In this museum , you are not supposed to take pictures . __eou__ Is that right ? I didn't know it . __eou__ Will you give me your camera ? We have to confiscate your film . __eou__ Will you forgive me . Could you return my camera ? __eou__ We will keep and return it later . __eou__ Oh , I see . Then , can I buy slides and picture postcards somewhere ? __eou__ You can buy them at the souvenir shop near the exit . __eou__
Mary , I've some bad news for you . __eou__ I have already known that . I didn't get the scholarship , right ? __eou__ Yes . The board was favorably impressed with your application , but the competition was very fierce . __eou__ Can you help me ? You know I do need the scholarship . __eou__ I'm afraid I can't I advise you to try again next year . __eou__ Thank you . I will . __eou__
How can I lose weight , doctor ? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food ? __eou__ Well , Jim . It is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals . __eou__ I never eat breakfast though . __eou__ That's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . You will not run your car without fuel , and as well you won't expect your body to work without food . __eou__ I never thought about it that way . __eou__ I bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch TV or read a book . Then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat . __eou__ Oh doctor , I feel so foolish . __eou__ Well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits . __eou__ I know doctor , thank you so much . __eou__
I am confused . How could a golfer need so many clubs ? Seems to me , 14 altogether , right __eou__ I should say , a a ' set ' of golf clubs is restricted to no more than 14 clubs . __eou__ Then what makes a ' set ' of clubs ? __eou__ In general , a set of golf clubs 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , PW ; Woods : 1 , 3 , 5 and a putter . __eou__ So many ? __eou__ This is not to say you have to carry all of these clubs . It depends on your preferences . __eou__ Have you heard of Tiger Woods ? __eou__ Of course even people who don't know anything about golf know his name . __eou__
Do you remember John from head office ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Have you heard what happened to him ? __eou__ No , what ? __eou__ He had his car stolen . Actually he was kidnapped while he was in the car . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , apparently , he was just getting into his car-he'd parked it in one of those underground multi-story things-he was just getting in and suddenly three guys with guns opened the back doors of the car and got in . __eou__ Crikey . Where did this happen ? __eou__ In Taichung , I think . __eou__ Oh , right , I hear they have a lot of this kind of problem down there . __eou__ Really ? Well , anyway , they pointed their guns at him and said , you know , keep calm and drive out . ... we don't want to hurt you ... we just want your car . __eou__ So what happened ? __eou__ Well , he drove out , and when he got to the booth to pay the attendant , he pretended to have an epileptic fit , you know , to scare the thieves away . The attendant was no help at all , even though the guys were holding guns in plain view , he did nothing . __eou__ That's terrible . __eou__ Yes , makes you think , doesn't it ? __eou__ So what happened next ? __eou__ Well , he kept on pretending to have a fit , so they freaked out and just ran away . __eou__ Well , he sure was lucky . __eou__ I'll say . __eou__
Are you a newcomer ? __eou__ Yeah , this is my first visit here . __eou__ You speak good English , though . __eou__ Thanks , but I speak English with a strong German accent . __eou__ But let me tell you , you're doing just fine . I couldn't do half as well as you do when I was learning German . By the way , how long have you been learning English ? __eou__ On and off , for quite a few years . __eou__
Do you still see the people we went to school with ? __eou__ I did for a while , I suppose , until I left university , but after that not really . __eou__ Yeah , I've lost touch with most people as well , but I still see Rose occasionally . __eou__ Oh yes , how's she getting on ? __eou__ OK , I suppose , but she's had a rough time in the last few years , She got divorced . __eou__ What , from Peter ? __eou__ Oh , of course . __eou__
I hear that Helen does not relate very well to her husband . __eou__ Unbelievable ! I remember her husband is her former classmate . They fell in love with each other in college . __eou__ So what ? Things have changed . __eou__
At last ! The weekend comes again ! __eou__ Yes . What will you do these two days ? __eou__ After five days ' hard work , I'm surely going to have some fun . __eou__ But I'd prefer to stay at home and have a good rest . __eou__
Bill , I must tell you the truth . You failed the English exam again . __eou__ Ah ? Really ? That stinks ! __eou__ Haha . April Fool's ! Did you forget what day it is today ? __eou__ Wow , you were pulling my leg all along . I was really fooled . __eou__ Alright , now let's be serious . Actually , you get high marks in the exam . __eou__
Did you have a good holiday ? __eou__ Yes and no . __eou__
How are you doing ? __eou__ I'm doing great . __eou__ What movies have you seen lately ? __eou__ I saw Forrest Gump the other day . __eou__ What type of movie is that ? __eou__ The movie type is drama . __eou__ I can't believe you are watching movies . The weather is great . You should be outside . __eou__ I hate the hot weather . I'd rather stay indoors with the air conditioner . __eou__ What else do you like to do besides watching movies ? __eou__ I like to play computer games , read books , go shopping , and play pool . __eou__ Out of those what is your favorite ? __eou__ My favorite is to play computer games . __eou__ What is your favorite computer game ? __eou__ My favorite is Diablo . It used to be Star Craft , but it is getting a little old . __eou__ If you like to play so much , when do you ever exercise ? __eou__ Although I hate to exercise , I go jogging at least twice a week . __eou__ That's pretty good . By the way , what are you doing next Saturday ? __eou__ I am going to go to the bookstore . __eou__ I am having a party Saturday night at my house . If you have time , you should come . __eou__ That sounds like fun . __eou__ Great . I'll see you on Saturday . __eou__ Ok . See you later . __eou__
Thanks a lot for having us . We had a good time . __eou__ I'm glad you came . You're welcome anytime . __eou__ Thanks . By the way , tell your wife she throws a great party . __eou__ I will . See you later . __eou__
Mike , these flowers are just gorgeous . __eou__ I ’ m glad you like them . Happy birthday ! __eou__ I can ’ t thank you enough . I ’ m really touched . I don ’ t know what to say . __eou__ Forget it . It ’ s my pleasure . You mean a lot to me . __eou__ You ’ re the best ! __eou__
Shall we sing with a karaoke ? __eou__ Great idea ! I do it every so often . __eou__ For us , karaoke is becoming a popular entertainment . __eou__ Yep . If you are a good singer , your audience will feel comfortable , right ? __eou__ I can not agree with you more . And if you are an awful one , that will be funny . __eou__ I remembered Tom is always out of tune . We burst into laughter . __eou__ Is that true ? Shall we invite him to join with us ? __eou__ So tricky ! __eou__
I'm afraid I can't complete my paper on time . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I keep on meeting with difficulties in the experiment . I can hardly go on . __eou__ Where there are difficulties , there are ways to get over them . Hold on ! __eou__
Have you heard Jenny divorced her French husband ? __eou__ Oh , really ? No wonder that she looks quite depressed recently . __eou__ Yes . They used to be joined at the hip . __eou__ I heard they were just married for half a year . __eou__ That ’ s true . She said they often argued over nickel-and-dime things . __eou__ Yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but full of culture shock . __eou__ You said it . You know , they fell in love at the first sight and quickly jumped into marriage . __eou__ Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married . __eou__ Definitely . Just hope Jenny can recover from the pain of divorce soon . __eou__
Where do you usually do your shopping , Mrs . Lane ? __eou__ I usually go to the supermarket , near the station . __eou__ How do you find the prices there ? __eou__ I think they are quite reasonable , and the vegetables are very fresh . __eou__ I see you have bought some coffee . Would you mind telling me how much you paid for it ? __eou__ Only 2 dollars and 25 cents . __eou__
Hello , what can I do for you ? __eou__ I am looking for a host home . __eou__ How long will you stay with the host family ? __eou__ Well , at least half a year . Do I have to do my own grocery shopping ? __eou__ Usually the host family prepares at least two meals a day for you . __eou__ That is fine . __eou__
I cannot understand why she always helps and supports her brother . __eou__ Why do you say so ? __eou__ Because he is often in trouble . __eou__ She has promised her mother that she would be with him through thick and thin . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__
Did you find what you were looking for ? __eou__ I tried when you had gone , but I had no luck . __eou__ Okay , let's both look for it now . __eou__ Okay . __eou__
I think I'm going to China this vacation.How about you ? __eou__ Me ? I prefer France . __eou__ I went to France last summer . __eou__ Oh , really ? I went to China last winter ! __eou__
Jenny , I was wondering if you , um ... are you busy this Friday ? __eou__ Yes , Friday I have a class right after work . __eou__ Oh . What about Saturday ? Are you free then ? __eou__ Saturday my parents are coming to town . What's up ? __eou__ What about tonight ? Do you have plans tonight ? __eou__ No . Did you want to go do something ? __eou__ Yes ! Yes ! I want to take you to dinner . __eou__ Oh ! That sounds great ! How about six o'clock ? __eou__
There's a typhoon coming . __eou__ Is that right ? __eou__ That's what the weatherman said last night . __eou__
Do you want to go out for dinner tonight ? __eou__ Sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ? __eou__ I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions . __eou__ That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ? __eou__ I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy . __eou__ If you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ? __eou__ I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy . __eou__ You're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us . __eou__ The Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food . __eou__ The Taj it is then . __eou__ Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ? __eou__ They'll still charge us a corkage fee . __eou__ That's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway . __eou__ Don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight . __eou__ Are you sure ? We could go Dutch . __eou__ No , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time . __eou__ I won't argue with that ! Let's go ! __eou__
Hello Martin . Have you been to any events yet ? __eou__ Yes I have . I went to the table tennis yesterday . __eou__ Oh wow . How was it ? __eou__ Oh . It was great . I love Ma Lin . He ’ s my favourite table tennis player . Have you seen anything yet ? __eou__ Oh I still haven ’ t managed to get any tickets . I ’ d love to see something though . __eou__ Well , let ’ s go to the marathon tomorrow then ! We can just stand by the side of the road . __eou__ What a great idea . __eou__
Hi ! Dear ! I'm waiting for you . __eou__ I know that . __eou__ You know , although we've chatted twice , I've been thinking of you already . __eou__ Me too . I want to know more about you , eg , what's your real name and what do you look like ... __eou__ & you ? __eou__ Look , I am playing the piano for you . __eou__ Oh , thanks . I wanna see the real you . __eou__ Sorry , I have no photo in my computer . And I have no scanner . I will show you later . __eou__ OK ! Before that I'll take this one as you . __eou__ Ha ! She is too little . __eou__ Cute , like you . __eou__ I want to tell you that I like you __eou__ Me too . Send you a kiss ... __eou__ Thx . __eou__
Hello . __eou__ Hi . __eou__ How are you ? __eou__ I'm good . How are you ? __eou__ Good . Do you speak English ? __eou__ A little . Are you American ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from California . __eou__ Nice to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you too . __eou__
Did you hear what she said to me ? __eou__ I heard it . __eou__ What do you think I should do about it ? __eou__ Just let it be . Her rudeness will come back to haunt her . __eou__
How many persons are there in your family ? __eou__ There are three , my parents and I . __eou__ Do you live together ? __eou__ No , I live alone in a flat near my work place . __eou__ Do you often go back to see your parents . __eou__ Yes , almost once a week . __eou__
Ben always appears rude to the people around him . __eou__ But he's really kind at heart . __eou__ That's true . We can not judge people by appearance . __eou__
I'm glad to have had the opportunity to meet you here . __eou__ I trust you ’ re keeping well ? __eou__ I'm doing great , thank you . __eou__ So we can get down to business . __eou__
What do you think of the Olympic motto ' Higher , faster and stronger ' ? __eou__ Well , it's better than ' Friendship first , competition second ' . __eou__ Why ? In my opinion , it doesn't matter whether you won or not . The most important thing is participation . __eou__ I still think nobody plays for nothing . __eou__
So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ? __eou__ Nine total . Seven children and my parents . __eou__ Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ? __eou__ Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it . __eou__ Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right . __eou__ It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make . __eou__ Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy . __eou__ That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs . __eou__ And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common . __eou__ Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college . __eou__
John , if you don't mind , I'd like to ask you a personal question . __eou__ I don't mind at all . __eou__ All right.Are you married ? __eou__ To tell you the truth , I'm not married . I'm still single . __eou__ Then , when do you plan to get married ? __eou__ I don't know.It ' s still up in tha air . __eou__
Miss Fallen , can you tell me why you want to get a visa to the States ? __eou__ To study . I am going to the University of Tampa to do a postgraduate course for three years . __eou__ And do you have the Letter of Acceptance from the University with you ? __eou__ Yes , here it is . __eou__ Thank you very much . And do you have any proof of the financial support for the three years ? __eou__ I've got a letter from my bank here . It shows I am able to support myself during these three years of studies . __eou__ Could I see that , please ? __eou__ Yes , here it is . __eou__ Thanks very much . Well , I'll be able to give you a visa for one year , a student visa , that is . __eou__ Oh , but mine is a three-year program . __eou__ Yes , it is a three-year , but you can renew the visa each year in the States . It is our usual procedure . __eou__ Okay , thank you . __eou__
It's a lovely day out today , isn't it ? __eou__ It's beautiful . Enjoy it while it lasts . It's supposed to get cold tomorrow . __eou__ What's the weather forecast for tomorrow ? __eou__ It's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there's a chance of freezing rain . __eou__ That doesn't sound pretty . __eou__ Do you have any plans for tomorrow ? __eou__ Well , I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends . __eou__ You might want to change your plans . With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery . __eou__ I suppose I should . I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . Do you have any plans for tomorrow ? __eou__ I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon . __eou__ If you're lucky , it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day ! __eou__ If that happens , then I'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies . __eou__ That sounds like fun . __eou__ Hey , look outside ! It's started to drizzle ! __eou__ English weather is even more predictable than I had previously thought . __eou__
Is there a city where it's always warm ? __eou__ Yes , there are many cities where it's almost always warm.San Diego , for example . __eou__ Are there any other cities where it's always hot ? __eou__ Many.Most of the cities in the southern part of the United States are hot all year . __eou__ But why do so many people live there ? __eou__ Most people grow accustomed to the climate , but there are many others who complain about it all the time . __eou__ Are there any cities where it rains a lot ? __eou__ Several.Two good examples are Seattle , in the state of Washington , and Portland , Oregon . __eou__ Tell us about some cold cities . __eou__ In the north there are many cities which are very cold in the winter.Boston and Chicago are two of them . __eou__ Is it always cold in Chicago and Boston ? __eou__ Oh , no.On the contrary , there are many beautiful days , especially in the spring and fall . __eou__
Mark , you are not telling me the truth . Now why ? __eou__ Promise you are not going to be angry ? __eou__ Yes , all right . So why ? Go on then . Say it . Oh , really , Mark . I promise I'm not going to be angry . Now why were you late ? __eou__ I forgot . __eou__ You forgot ? You ... __eou__ Ah , ah , you promised , and remember ? __eou__
Long time no see ! __eou__ Yes . It has been a long time since the last time we met . __eou__ It's nice to see you again . Have you changed jobs ? __eou__ No . I've been visiting relatives recently . __eou__ That's nice . Where have you been ? __eou__ I went to visit an uncle in San Francisco . __eou__ Are you busy now ? __eou__ No . Why ? __eou__ How about a coffee in that cafe ? __eou__ Great . Let's talk over coffee . __eou__
I'm really fed up with Larry ! He's the biggest airhead I've ever met.He always makes careless mistakes , and he's a pain to work with . __eou__ You shouldn't be so negative.You ' ll always have some co-workers that are harder to work with than others.But if you are negative and start name-calling in the office , it will make a bad working environment for everybody . __eou__ You only say that because you don't have to work with him.The people in your department seem so capable and nice to be around.Take Mary for example.She ' s smart and enthusiastic . I've never met anyone as cheery as she is . __eou__ Everybody has their strengths and weaknesses.Even Larry.He might be a pain to be around , but he's also very good at staying in budget on projects.Mary , on the other hand , spends our project money like there's no tomorrow.Also , she's never willing to stay a little later at the office.She always leaves at 5pm sharp . __eou__ Isn't there anyone in the office that is a perfect co-worker ? What about Bob ? Everybody loves Bob.Even though he's flesh out of college and still a bit green , he is a great co-worker . __eou__ You're right.He ' s a hard worker , easy to get along with , honest , and he never steals the credit on projects.The only thing he's lacking in is experience . __eou__ Maybe that's why he's so nice ! __eou__
You look pale recently . __eou__ Yeah . I have got much pressure in the company . I have to be wrapped up in my work . __eou__ Take good care of yourself . __eou__ Thank you . I will . __eou__
Watch your step . There's a hole in the sidewalk . __eou__ Oh , I see.Thank you . __eou__
I hear little Bob has recovered . __eou__ That's a great relief . I was worried about him . __eou__ The operation was very successful . __eou__ His parents must feel very happy . __eou__
I can ’ t believe that Anthony is finally getting married ! __eou__ Yeah well it ’ s about time ! He ’ s been living with his parents for 40 years ! __eou__ Don ’ t be mean . Look here come the bridesmaids ! Their dresses look beautiful ! __eou__ Who are those kids walking down the aisle ? __eou__ That ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew.Oh , they look so cute ! __eou__ I just hope the priest makes it quick . I ’ m starving . I hope the food ’ s good at the reception . __eou__ That ’ s all you ever think about , food ! Oh , I think the bride ’ s coming now ! She looks gorgeous.Wait , what ’ s she doing ? Where ’ s she going ? __eou__ Oh great ! Does this mean that the reception is canceled ? __eou__
Hello everyone , and welcome to our CPR for beginners course.First of all , does anyone know what CPR stands for ? __eou__ Cardiopulmonary resuscitation ! __eou__ That ’ s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest . __eou__ What does that mean ? __eou__ Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ’ s begin ! I need a volunteer . __eou__ Me ! Me ! __eou__ Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this . __eou__ Wait , what are you doing ? I ’ m a married woman ! You can ’ t just try to kiss me like this ! __eou__ Madam I ’ m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency . __eou__ Well , OK . But no French kissing ! __eou__ As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . To do this , we place our hands over the person ’ s chest , and press down firmly two or three times . __eou__ Wait , what are you doing ! You can ’ t just kiss me then go for second base ! __eou__
You ’ re not going to believe what happened today . You ’ Ve got to promise to keep it to yourself . __eou__ Sure , what gives ? __eou__ Today Mr . Leo threw Sally out of class ! __eou__ On the level ? __eou__ I ’ ll say . I knew Sally would finally show her true colors . When she got her final test results back from Mr . Leo , she started yelling at him . You should have heard her . I ’ Ve never seen anyone get so upset before . To make a long story short , it seems that Mr . Leo failed her because he caught her cheating . __eou__ That ’ s no laughing matter . That means she ’ ll have to take the whole course again . I can ’ t believe she ’ s going to have to start from the beginning . __eou__ It serves her right ! __eou__
This is my uncle , Charles . __eou__ He looks strong.What does he do ? __eou__ He's a captain . __eou__ He must be very brave . __eou__ Exactly ! __eou__

By the way , I heard your son recently graduated ! __eou__ Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know . __eou__ He is such a handsome guy . He gets his looks from his mother of course ! __eou__ Thank you ! What about your daughter , Pamela ? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently . __eou__ Oh yes . She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended . __eou__ Such a lovely girl . I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday ! __eou__ But of course ! Well , it ’ s been great talking to you , but I have to get going . __eou__ Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee ! __eou__ That would be great ! Give me a call ! __eou__ See you soon ! Bye ! Egg ... I can ’ t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter . __eou__

Do you know that John isn't going to come back to our school ? __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ He had moved and held a party on July 1st . __eou__ It's a pity that I was traveling around Europe at that time . __eou__ Even he's not coming back to school anymore , you still can call him and meet him on weekends . __eou__ You're right ! I will call him this weekend and meet him . __eou__
I went to Rotes ’ , you know , Edith Roth is the author of a book about moths . __eou__ Is she ? I thought she was a mathematician . __eou__ I ’ m so thirsty . __eou__ Are you ? I thought you had something to drink at her home . __eou__ No . Edith didn ’ t give anything to drink . __eou__ I ’ ll buy you a drink . __eou__ Oh ! Thank you . __eou__
How long will it take us to drive to London ? __eou__ I think it ’ s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to London , so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway . __eou__ That ’ s unless there is a traffic jam . It could take three hours . __eou__ You ’ re right . We will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built-up area . __eou__ So , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ? __eou__ Ok . You haven ’ t seen my company car , have you ? __eou__ No . let me take a look ... It ’ s longer than my car . __eou__ I think it ’ s over five meters long . I can ’ t remember exactly . It has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour . __eou__ Wow ! That ’ s fast ! I don ’ t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway . __eou__ We can ’ t . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit . __eou__
I ’ m Miss Sherman . What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ Well , apparently I ’ Ve run up quite a bill . I was under the impression that the Junior Executive Holiday Package only cost 250 dollars per night . I ’ Ve just been informed that it ’ s actually 500 do __eou__ That ’ s true . For the Junior Executive Room ... three nights ... yes , your bill should be $ 1,500 __eou__ But I definitely was led to believe that a three-night stay would be $ 750 . __eou__ The advertised rate is based on double occupancy . __eou__ When I booked the room , your staff didn ’ t mention this . And the brochure and your promotional mailings do not mention that . __eou__ Are you quite sure ? __eou__ Yes . Have a look . __eou__ I see . I had no idea our advertising was so misleading . It is here , but it ’ s in the fine print on the last page . __eou__ Perhaps you could arrange to provide me with a new bill that reflects the advertised rate . __eou__ Normally I couldn ’ t do that . But under the circumstances , I ’ ll see what I can arrange.Customer satisfaction is our primary aim . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots . __eou__ It was me . I am so sorry . __eou__ What did you think you were doing ? __eou__ I had to move it , so that I can get my bike through . __eou__ How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong . __eou__ I am awfully sorry . I didn't think you would mind so much . __eou__ Never do that again . __eou__ I promise . __eou__
Is anything the matter , sir ? __eou__ Yes , it's my steak . __eou__ What's wrong with it , sir ? __eou__ It's too raw .

I've had enough . __eou__ How about some coffee or tea then ? __eou__ Yes , I will have a cup of coffee . __eou__
Joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? Let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ? __eou__ Fine with me . I just want to get this over with . It ’ s important we make a clean break . I should have signed a pre-nup . __eou__ What was that ? __eou__ Nothing ! Anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty.My lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement - I keep the cat and you get the dog . So that ’ s done ... finally . __eou__ Let ’ s not go there , Joanne ! Ok , so let ’ s start with the record collection , I ’ ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back . __eou__ Fine , but I ’ m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me . __eou__ I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it ! __eou__ He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! __eou__ Whatever ! Alright , I ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that I get the silver tea set . __eou__ How typical , when are you ever going to use a silver tea set ? Fine ! I don ’ t want to drag this out any longer than necessary . What ’ s next ? What about these old photographs ? __eou__ Which ones ? Let me have a look.Wow , look at that ! That brings back memories ... That ? __eou__ Our trip to Italy ! I remember that day . We were going to visit the Trev fountain , and we got caught in the rain ... __eou__ ... and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet . I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley , smiling and laughing in the rain ... __eou__ Oh , we really did have fun back then , didn ’ t we ? __eou__ Oh , Joanne , are we making a big mistake ? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? I still love you . __eou__ Oh Jeff ! I love you too ! I ’ m so glad we didn ’ t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle . __eou__ The motorcycle ? But that ’ s mine ! __eou__

I can look anybody in the face because I ’ Ve done nothing to make me feel guilty or something . __eou__ There are not so many people like you . __eou__ You are flattering me . __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m doing some research on Roman civilization . Do you have any books on the subject ? __eou__ These books over here are about ancient history . They might be helpful . __eou__ Can I check this one out ? __eou__ I ’ m sorry . It ’ s for reference only , so it must stay in the library . But you ’ re welcome to look through it . __eou__ Ok . And I ’ d like to check these books out . __eou__ All right . They ’ re due back next Wednesday . __eou__ Thanks for your help . __eou__
Do you have much experience with kids ? __eou__ Yes . I have three sons . Actually I also have a grandson . __eou__ To tell you the truth , sometimes I regret having a baby so early . I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby . __eou__ I understand . I was in your position before . At that time I couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me . My husband seldom stayed at home . __eou__ What about your mother ? Did she help you ? __eou__ Yes , she did a little . But you see , Americans are different from Chinese . You can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . She could baby-sit only once or twice a week . That ’ s it . I had to care for them most of the time . __eou__ I see . So if my little family goes to America , I would end up taking care of my child all the time . My husband would have to make the bread for us . I just don ’ t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . You can take night classes . I did that when I had kids . And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . Then you could find a job and work . __eou__ Sounds not so easy to me . When that happens , I will be too old to learn . __eou__ No . You see , I went back to school to get my Master ’ s Degree when I was in my thirties . You won ’ t be older than that . __eou__
Now I know why I split up with Mike . We found we were simply not good for each other . __eou__ In what ways ? __eou__ Well , he is a typical Sagittarius guy , while I am a Cancer . We aren't really compatible __eou__ Ha-ha , so you believe in astrology ? __eou__ What's strange about that ! As a person born under the sign of Cancer , I am home-loving and wish for a peaceful family life . But according to astrology , Sagittarius guys are too adventurous and risk-taking.They seldom think of leading a settled and peaceful life . __eou__ Is that so ? I'm afraid it is too narrow-minded to judge people using astrology . It's all stereotypes ! __eou__ But in my case , the fact matches the theory . Mike is humorous , energetic , always as fresh as a daisy , but probably too ambitious . It frightens me ! __eou__ But as far as I remember , you two caught on like a house on fire when you first met . __eou__ Exactly . But later on , he cares more about his career than love . Work seems to be the better all , and all for him-so much that he doesn't even grudge sparing a day out with me . __eou__
What does your father do ? __eou__ He is a worker . __eou__ What about your mother ? __eou__ She is a nurse . __eou__
When is your birthday ? __eou__ August 1st . __eou__ Do you usually have a birthday party ? __eou__ Yes , we do.My parents prepare dinner for me . __eou__ What would you do at the party ? __eou__ We sing " Happy Birthday " at the party and have birthday cakes . __eou__ Do you know when people began to sing the song " Happy Birthday " ? __eou__ Well , I don't know . __eou__ Let me tell you the story.In 1892 , Patty Smith Hill and Mildred Hill wrote a song called ' Good Morning to you ' . But later someone added the words ' Happy Birthday ' to their tune . __eou__ So the ' Happy Birthday ' song has been popular since then ? __eou__ Yes , actually , the song has been sung since its publication in 1932.People all over the world have sung it in many different languages . __eou__
Wow ! Look at all these books ! I bet I can find a book about anything here ! __eou__ Shih ! ! Please keep your voice down . There are people reading and studying here . __eou__ Ok , I'm sorry . Are you the librarian ? Maybe you can help me , I am looking for a book . __eou__ Yes I am . You can check our online catalog to search the book you want based on the genre , title or if you know the author , I can point you towards the right direction . __eou__ I am looking for a book that has nursery rhymes . __eou__ That would be in our children's section . That book shelf there on the right . __eou__ Ok , I would like to check out these books . __eou__ Do you have a library card ? __eou__ No . How do I get one ? __eou__ I just need to see your drivers license or utility bill to prove that you a resident of this state . __eou__ Here you go . __eou__ So you are all set . You can have these books for two weeks . If you need to have them longer , you can bring them here to renew them . If you don't , you get charged ten cents a day for each book . __eou__ Ok , thanks ! __eou__

We'll be waiting for you . __eou__
Kim ! I'm here ! I brought all my old maternity clothes plus Dave and Alice's baby clothes ! __eou__ It's a little early for those , isn't it ? I still have eight months to go ... __eou__ Believe me , the time will fly by ! Before you know it , you'll be changing diapers ! You have to start preparing ! __eou__ I thought we could turn the upstairs study into a baby room . What do you think about lavender ? __eou__ I'll be back tomorrow with my work clothes and a gallon of lavender paint ! You just sit back and relax ! __eou__
You got a letter in the mail . __eou__ Give it to me . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ It ’ s my acceptance letter from UCLA . __eou__ What does it say ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been accepted ! __eou__ Are you serious ? __eou__ I ’ m serious . __eou__ Good for you ! __eou__ NYU was my first choice , but UCLA is just fine . __eou__ I ’ m so proud of you . __eou__ Thanks . I ’ m proud of myself , too . __eou__
DO you have any plan for your future ? __eou__ I'd prefer to go abroad , if possible . __eou__ Many people are striving for going abroad nowadays.It seems to be a trend . __eou__ I'm one of them . __eou__
Too bad you missed Jane's performance . __eou__ How's it ? __eou__ It was so perfect that it won a unanimous 10 . __eou__
I went shopping without my umbrella yesterday morning . __eou__ Yesterday morning was beautiful I thought the sunning was going to continue . __eou__ So did I . that's why I didn't take my umbrella . I got cold in the rain in the afternoon . It was raining cats and dogs . __eou__ I know . I could not believe it when I got hit by that storm . It was pouring with rain all afternoon . __eou__ We really have some movable weather sometime . I wish I would live somewhere which were sunning all year round . __eou__ If it was sunning all year round there would be drought . You probably would not like it either . __eou__ I guess you are right . Maybe I just wish the weather could be a little more predictable . __eou__ The weather forecasters are not good at predicting the weather would be like . Our weather is so changeable . __eou__
Your garden is looking beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful . __eou__ Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ? __eou__ Yes , I do . Those are violets , aren ’ t they ? __eou__ Yes , they are . This afternoon , I ’ m going to prune the hedge . __eou__ The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ? __eou__ Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed . __eou__ When the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree . __eou__ Tomorrow , I ’ ll cut the grass . Then the garden will lock perfect . __eou__ Just make sure children don ’ t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers . __eou__
You're late . __eou__ I know I'm late . I'm sorry . I tried to call you to tell you , but your phone seems to be disconnected . __eou__ My phone ? __eou__ Yes . An automatic message says your phone is not in service . __eou__ Really ? I had no idea . Let me check.Yes , it's dead . There's no dial tone . __eou__ So I couldn't get through . I knew I'd be late because my car wouldn't start.It was too cold I had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . That's why I'm late . __eou__ But this is terrible . I'm expecting important calls . __eou__ About what ? __eou__ You know what.The theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play.They are supposed to call me this evening.If I don't have a phone . Oh , what can I do ? __eou__ Well , the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast . __eou__ Do you have a cell phone ? __eou__ No . I hate cell phones.But you could go to a neighbor's house and use their phone . __eou__ Can you drive me ? I will go to Ann's house . It isn't far . I can call the theater guild from there and give them her number.She will let us wait in her living room . __eou__ Yes , of course I can drive you.So you don't want to get your phone fixed right away ? __eou__ Yes , I do.At Ann's house I will call the phone company and have them check my line.If they can fix it right away without coming to my house , then we'll just return here.But if not , I need to wait at Ann's house to talk with the theater guild.It ' s very important to me . __eou__ Alright , let's go . __eou__ Yes , let's go . __eou__
Linda , would you care for some candies or cookies ? __eou__ No , don't try to tend me . I'm becoming chubby , and I have to slender down . __eou__ You are not really chubby . You are actually thin enough . __eou__ I don't think so . I know I've put on weight this winter . __eou__ So you are watching your weight , aren't you ? __eou__ Yes , to tell you the truth . I am on the diet . __eou__

Is the environment a big issues in your country ? It is in mine . __eou__ It is in mine too . The biggest issue is water . The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important . __eou__ What methods do you use to conserve water ? __eou__ Water is rationed . We can only use a certain amount each month . It means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . They use too much water . __eou__ I see . I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . __eou__ Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . __eou__ We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . __eou__ The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don ’ t believe that any single country can do anything about it . __eou__ I think you ’ re right . There needs to be an international response to this problem . __eou__

I also greatly enjoy romance and comedy . __eou__ the Notebook is this type of movie . __eou__ really ? I haven't heard of it . __eou__ well then , this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . I bet you'd love it . __eou__ Ok . I can't wait to see it . Let's go ! __eou__
Good evening.Welcome to our program . __eou__ Thank you.Good evening , Mr.Dean . __eou__ Would you tell us your name , please ? __eou__ I'm Helen Baker . __eou__ Glad to meet you , Ms.Baker . __eou__ Glad to meet you , too . __eou__ Where are you from , Ms.Baker ? __eou__ I'm from New Zealand . __eou__ What do you do for a living ? __eou__ I'm a teacher . __eou__ Thank you for coming , Ms.baker . __eou__
Congratulations on the new house ! __eou__ Thanks ! We love it . __eou__ Well , you guys worked hard for it . It's really beautiful . __eou__ I'm just not looking forward to cleaning it ! __eou__
You married Joe , didn't you ? __eou__ Joe ? I don't know what you mean . __eou__ I remember you are in love . __eou__ Oh , I took a shine to him when we met for the first time . But it comes and goes . __eou__ It's Greek to me . __eou__
Looks like a good party , I probably know about half the people . __eou__ Who ’ s that boy ? __eou__ Where ? __eou__ The one next to the telephone . __eou__ I don ’ t know . Never saw him before . Why ? __eou__ I think he ’ s the boy who just moved into my apartment building . __eou__
All the soldiers in that country are armed to the teeth . __eou__ What's happening in that country ? __eou__ The neighboring country is threatening their sovereignty with its nuclear bombs . __eou__
What ’ s the matter , BOB ? __eou__ I think it ’ s my ankle . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ One of my snow-shoes that cause on rocks . __eou__ Can you stand ? __eou__ I don ’ t think so . It ’ s kind of sore . __eou__ what I have to give you a hospital for an ex-treat . __eou__ It ’ s that really necessary ? __eou__ It maybe worse than it seems . __eou__
What a brilliant smile ! __eou__ That's my cousin Hubert.He likes smiling . __eou__ He must be very easy-going . __eou__ Sure , he's ready to be friendly with anyone . __eou__
Which season do you like best ? __eou__ I like spring best . It is neither too cold nor too hot . Freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . How about you ? __eou__ I prefer summer , especially the summer evenings . When the sun comes down , it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . After a rain shower , the smell of the air is refreshing . It is also a best reason for ice-cream . __eou__ How do you get through the stuffy daytime ? __eou__ Well , I have to hide in the air-conditioned rooms . Anyway , it is all worth , just think about the cool evening time . __eou__
Hi , Betty ! Where's your boyfriend ? __eou__ I have no idea . __eou__
Guess what ? Paul and Susan are engaged . __eou__ Really ? When did that happen ? __eou__ A week ago ? They met last summer and now just sink . They will be married soon . __eou__ Have they set a date for the wedding ? __eou__ No , not yet . But Susan says they ’ d like to get married in November or December . Then they ’ ll go to Hawaii for their honeymoon . __eou__
Hello , Mary . How are you ? __eou__ Not bad . How about you , John ? __eou__ Fine . Thank you . __eou__
When were you born may I ask ? __eou__ On 20th May 1963 . __eou__ Do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ? __eou__ 27th day of the fourth month . __eou__ By the way , could you tell me when the film will begin ? __eou__ It will begin at 5:30 . __eou__ I am afraid I can't be there on time . __eou__ You can see it tomorrow . __eou__ I don't want to miss it today . __eou__
When the rain stops , you ’ ll see how beautiful the beach is . __eou__ But the rain has been pouring down for two days . We ’ Ve both caught colds . __eou__ And this bedroom is too big and damp . But it ’ s better than a tent . __eou__ How unlucky ! Let ’ s pack our bags and go home . __eou__
Hi , Sue . What's up ? __eou__ Hey , Andrew . How's everything with work ? __eou__ Ok , I guess . My boss has been on my back recently . __eou__ Really ? What's he been doing ? __eou__ You know , just giving me lots to do . I'm really busy right now . __eou__ Are you ? What are you busy with ? __eou__ Oh , lots of things . Mostly training new people . __eou__
So Kim , have you ever had anything stolen ? __eou__ Stolen ? No , why ? __eou__ My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days . __eou__ Criminals are clever ? They ’ re only successful when people are careless . __eou__ I don ’ t know . The ones who stole my uncle ’ s motorcycle were pretty good . __eou__ If your uncle had an alarm system , then it wouldn ’ t have happened . __eou__ He did . It was one of the best ones available . But that didn ’ t stop them from disabling it . And on a crowded street too . __eou__ Didn ’ t anyone stop them ? __eou__ You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that . No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen . The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away . __eou__ Wow , they were good . I guess criminals aren ’ t that dumb after all . __eou__ That ’ s not the end . They were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck . __eou__
Would you and your wife care to come to our place and have tea with us some afternoon ? __eou__ Why , that's very kind of you , Mrs . Johnson . I'm sure my wife will be glad to . __eou__ How about tomorrow afternoon ? __eou__ Tomorrow afternoon would be fine . __eou__
A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ? __eou__ I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ? __eou__ Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals . __eou__ Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills . __eou__ Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance . __eou__ Ok , then we can sign up for it together . __eou__
Would you like any toast , dear ? __eou__ Um ? __eou__ Toast , dear ? __eou__ As you like . __eou__ Would you like any tea , dear ? __eou__ It doesn ’ t make any difference to me . __eou__ Oh , you ’ re not listening to me . __eou__ Leave me alone . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ I need to copy some pages in my book . __eou__ The copier is right over there , in the corner . __eou__ Do I need to pay to use it ? __eou__ You have to pay to use the copier . __eou__ How much do you charge ? __eou__ You need to pay ten cents for every copy . __eou__ Is there a maximum number of copies I can make ? __eou__ You can make as many copies as you want . __eou__ I ’ m going to need you to show me how to use the machine . __eou__ There are instructions posted on the copier . __eou__ Thank you for your help . __eou__
You seem to be very tired . __eou__ Yes , I have been working for eight hours . __eou__ Why don't you join us to go out for a walk ? __eou__ No , really . I'm not in the mood for it . __eou__
Simon , may I introduce you to Linda ? You don ’ t know each other , do you ? __eou__ No . I ’ Ve not had the pleasure of meeting her yet . __eou__ How do you do ? I ’ m pleased to meet you . __eou__ How do you do ? __eou__ Please sit down . Help yourself just like you are at home . __eou__ What would you like to drink ? __eou__ A cup of coffee , please . __eou__
So , what do you think ? How do you like New York ? __eou__ I'm having a great time . I love it . I'm glad we came . __eou__ Yeah . I really like the stores and the shopping . __eou__ I love the museums , too . __eou__ But the traffic is pretty bad . __eou__ Yeah . I hate all this traffic . It's really noisy . __eou__ Listen , it's almost dinnertime.There are lots of restaurant around here.What do you want to try ? Italian ? Greek ? Japanese ? Thai ? __eou__ I can't stand making decisions . You choose ! __eou__ OK . Let's go American . Where's the nearest McDonald's ? __eou__
I have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . I feel exhausted . __eou__ You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard . __eou__ You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ’ t sleep well . What ’ s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation . __eou__
What's that ? __eou__ It's a surprise ! __eou__ For me ? __eou__ Yes . Let's go inside and you can open it up . __eou__ Wow ! It's big ! What could it be ? __eou__ I'll give you two clues . First , it cost more than $ 250 . And second , it's not big , but fat . __eou__ What does that mean , not big but fat ? You didn't buy ... __eou__
What would you like to drink ? __eou__ I'll just have water . __eou__
You seem depressed these days . What's the matter ? __eou__ I went bankrupt and I'm flat broke now . __eou__ If I can do anything for you , don't hesitate to let me know . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Good luck . I've got class in a few minutes . __eou__ Me too . I'll talk to you later . __eou__ OK . See you later . __eou__
Hi , Natasha , how's life ? __eou__ Great . My family came to visit me . __eou__ Oh , you must be very happy . How many people are there in your family ? __eou__ My immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me . __eou__ I have a small family . They are my parents , my younger brother and me . __eou__ I thought you were the only child in the family . Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ? __eou__ Yes , it did . But my parents are ethnic minority people . It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children . __eou__ Interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ? __eou__ The child must feel very longly . My younger brother is 10 years younger than me . Before he was born , I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one day . __eou__ Do you get along well with each other ? __eou__ Yes , we are very close . He is 12 years old now and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot . __eou__ You are very lucky to have such a nice family . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Don't you think it might be a good idea to hold the party outside ? __eou__ I don't think so . __eou__ How about going to a concert ? __eou__ That suits me fine . __eou__
Every year , the South has the floods . It is an act of God . __eou__ Do you really think so ? __eou__ Yeah , you have some other ideas ? __eou__ I think , in some way it is an act of God , but in another way , it just is caused by us . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ We didn't pay attention to the environment , cut down trees and polluted the air . __eou__ Oh , I see . Fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things . __eou__
Good morning , Mary ! __eou__ Good morning , John ! __eou__ I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ? __eou__ I'd be delighted to , John . Saturday did you say ? __eou__ Yes , if that's all right for you . __eou__ I'm pretty sure I'll be all right . In fact , I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you.What time are you planning to start ? __eou__ Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner . __eou__ That sounds fine . I'll be there around seven . __eou__
Bye , mom ! __eou__ Wait , Jimmy , it ’ s cold outside . Put a hat on ! __eou__ OK . Bye ! __eou__ No , wait , you will be too cold without mittens . __eou__ Alright . See ya ! __eou__ Hold on , with that wind , you ’ re going to catch a cold . Wear this scarf . __eou__ Ok , see you after school ... __eou__ Oh ... and ear muffs ! Put these on ... here we go . __eou__ Mom ? __eou__ Yes , honey ... __eou__ I ... I can ’ t breathe . __eou__
Jane , pleases come with us . __eou__ I cannot dance , you know . I have't such a talent . __eou__ Just for fun , not for showing . What do you worry about ? __eou__ Nothing . I have told you before that I won't go to the party and that's flat . __eou__ But ... OK . __eou__
Who is your favorite music composer ? __eou__ I don't have one single favorite , but these days I listen to a lot of Chopin . __eou__ Then you must despise such modern music as rock ? __eou__ Without doubt , rock is trash . __eou__
It's a lovely day , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice . __eou__ Is she American ? __eou__ Yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams ! __eou__ So I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ? __eou__ I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her . __eou__ Sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ? __eou__ Not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby . __eou__ That's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ? __eou__ You bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight . __eou__ Good luck ! __eou__ Thanks ! __eou__
Do you think you'll get the project ? __eou__ It's a chance in a million . I hear John is interested in it . __eou__ I see.After all , he's boss's son . __eou__ But anyway , I'll have a try . __eou__
Are you feeling better today , Bill ? __eou__ Well , it ’ s hard to say . I coughed a lot in the evening . __eou__ You ’ d better give up smoking . It ’ s bad for your health . __eou__ You ’ re right . But you know it ’ s so hard to give up the old habit like smoking . __eou__ But you should make up your mind first . __eou__ You know I often have to work far into the night . I need smoking to keep me awake . __eou__ Why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? You ’ ll have the same time for work . __eou__ Thank you for your advice . I ’ ll try it . __eou__
Oh ! __eou__ What fools we were ! __eou__ To think of it ! All my old silver ! It meant so much to me . __eou__ And my new car . To think that he simply drove off with everything in my car . That's what hurts me most . __eou__ What's so terrible too , is the fools we've made of ourselves . __eou__ I hardly dare call the police . They'll just laugh at us . __eou__ I'll never get over it . Oh , Harry , it was all so unnecessary . That man ! ! How could he do this to us after we'd put him up ? __eou__ And his story didn't even hold together . I feel such an idiot . __eou__
I just saw Something About Mary last night . It was hilarious . __eou__ David took me to it last week . I thought it was a little sick . __eou__ What do you mean sick ? It was really funny , don't you think ? __eou__ It was entertaining in some ways . But in general I didn't like it . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I just think the humor was too gross . There were too many disgusting things in it . I don't think a comedy has to have so much smut to be funny . __eou__ It wasn't a dirty movie . There wasn't even any nudity . __eou__ No , you're right . But nudity doesn't bother me . What bothered me were all the jokes about masturbation , stuff like that . It was too sick . __eou__ Oh , you are too conservative . It's just realistic . __eou__ I don't think it's realistic . I thought it was sick . Why does a movie have to use that kind of humor ? __eou__ People think it's funny . __eou__
Do you know how to go to the Fragrant Hills in Beijing ? I heard that they are very famous in China . __eou__ Yes . Especially in autumn , the red leaves of the maple trees make the whole mountain red . __eou__ That must be very beautiful . __eou__ Yes , it can make people feel as if they were in the land of fairies . __eou__ Really ? Have you ever been there ? __eou__ A couple of times . __eou__ Can you go there with me ? I'd like someone who is familiar with that area to go with me . __eou__ Sure . I'd be very glad to be your tour guide . __eou__
Have you heard that Tom and his wife divorced ? __eou__ I didn't hear that . But I can deduce the reason . __eou__ Really ? Say it ! __eou__ Tom is a kind guy , but addicted to gambling . He spends all his time gambling in the casino . And his wife can't put up with his incessant gambling any longer , so she divorced him . Is that right ? __eou__ Yeah , quite right . Gambling broke up a happy family . __eou__ Yeah ! Gambling is often a curse . By gambling we lose time and treasure , two things most precious to a man . __eou__ Besides that , many people took to gambling and got in over their heads , and gradually ruined themselves . __eou__ In a word , gambling is a vice . We should be away from it . __eou__
Professor , could I make an appointment with you ? __eou__ I am free tomorrow afternoon between two and four ; do you have a particular time in mind ? __eou__ Two o'clock would be the best time . __eou__ Fine , do you know where my office is ? __eou__ No , I'm not sure . __eou__ Remember , it is in the E building on the third floor . __eou__ I see . __eou__ Don't worry , it will work out fine once you get there . I'll see you then . __eou__ I'll see you then . __eou__ Looking forward to meeting with you ! __eou__
Have you gone bowling before ? __eou__ No . Could you tell me something more about it ? I want to play well . __eou__ There are 10 frames in a bowling game . Each player is allowed to bowl two balls in each frame . __eou__ You just said 10 rounds . __eou__ ' Round ' and ' frame ' are two different terms . __eou__ Perhaps you can tell me a little more about this . __eou__ Hey , slow down . I'll tell you more while playing . __eou__
I'm told Cold Blood just finished its last cut . __eou__ Yeah , it'll make a hit , I think.When will it be on , do you know ? __eou__ Sure , it'll be on next Monday . __eou__
Hectic . It's always hectic . But how was your windsurfing ? __eou__ I tried it for a half-hour.It was interesting , but ... well ... I couldn't really do it . __eou__ See ? I told you . It's very hard . __eou__ I couldn't even stand on it and hold the sail . I probably fell down fifty times . __eou__ Fifty times ? __eou__ Yes , it was really stupid . __eou__ And how much did it cost to rent it ? __eou__ It was fifty dollars for a half-hour . __eou__ Well , that's not too bad then . __eou__ What do you mean ? It's expensive ! __eou__ Yes , but you have to calculate a little.You paid fifty dollars and you fell down fifty times.So you only spent one dollar per fall . That's cheap . __eou__
How's your girlfriend ? __eou__ We broke up . __eou__
How are you tonight , sir ? __eou__ Oh , not too bad . I'm just glad the weekend's finally here . __eou__ I know what you mean . What can I get for you ? __eou__ Give me a screwdriver on the rocks . __eou__ One screwdriver , coming right up . ( He mixes the drink . ) Here you are , sir . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
I think you should look over these figures again . There are some calculations that are a bit off . __eou__ I apologize . This should not have to be this way . __eou__ Apology is accepted . Try to do better next time . __eou__ Of course , I should have been more careful . I ’ m sorry . __eou__
You didn ’ t show up in the morning meeting . What ’ s up ? __eou__ Well , I just came in . I worked overtime yesterday . Some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate . So I stayed to double check them . The boss was aware of my very late work of last night . So before he left office , he told me I could come one hour later this morning . __eou__ But you still look a little bit tired . What time did you leave ? __eou__ It was around one thirty in the morning . I guess I didn ’ t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind . I just couldn ’ t stop thinking about them . __eou__ That ’ s normal after a tense work evening . Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . Once , I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later . __eou__ Working at weekend is something I hate to do most . __eou__ But if the company asks , what else can we do ? __eou__
Hi ! It's still seven o'clock . Are you crazy ? __eou__ I got the information that there is a killer sale at the shopping mall near our block . Get up and I will wait for you at the gate of our flat . __eou__ Every time when you glimpse some stylish clothes , you change into another person . __eou__ Stop complaining , OK ? __eou__ No wonder you are named shopaholic . __eou__ No , I am not a shopaholic , but a super shopaholic . And I really enjoy smelling the gorgeous clothes and new bags . __eou__ Wait a moment . And you can check where other sales are . __eou__
What's wrong , Bob ? __eou__ I was wondering if you could company me to the Ball ? __eou__ Of course , I will . __eou__ That's great . I'll pick you up at eight . __eou__
How do I look in this new dress ? __eou__ You ’ d better change it . It ’ s ugly . __eou__ How about this one ? __eou__ It ’ s really elegant and it fits you really well . __eou__
They must be your parents , what do they do ? __eou__ My mother is a professor and my father is a manager . __eou__ Do they often take you out ? __eou__ No , usually they're very busy . __eou__
You did well on the math test . __eou__ Of course . __eou__ Don ’ t you always fail in the math tests ? __eou__ Things were different this time . I sat by a math genius . __eou__ Huh ? You mean you snuck a peek at his test ? __eou__ B :: Come on ! I just took a glance . __eou__ Are you crazy ? You were cheating . __eou__
I can't decide whether to go to university or to get a job . __eou__ Well , if I were you , I'd go on studying . __eou__ But I don't even know what to study . __eou__ If I had chance again , I'd major in English . You're good at language . __eou__ That's what my parents want me to do . __eou__ You should take their advice . They know what's best for you.But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun , while I spend all my time doing reading and writing . __eou__ But if you go to university , you'll still have time for fun . __eou__ Hm , what you say makes sense . But you know , I still have to ask my parents for pocket money , and I hate to do so at this age . __eou__ And if you try to find a part-time job , you'll have some money too . __eou__ You're right . Thank you for the advice . __eou__
Well , I can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance . __eou__ John , they are old-fashioned people from the Chinese countryside . That ’ s their custom . __eou__ I know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning . __eou__ Don ’ t your relatives visit other relatives ? __eou__ Yes , but Americans never visit without calling in advance , and they almost never stay overnight . __eou__ I think that maybe Chinese families are closer than your families . __eou__ I think you ’ re right ! __eou__
I want to buy two tickets for tonight's concert . __eou__ Sure . How do you like your seats ? __eou__ Ordinary one , please . __eou__ Ok , here are your tickets in Row 13 . __eou__ I think they are too far from the stage . I want two in row 6 . __eou__ That's fine . But you have to pay another $ 10 . __eou__
Is this watch yours ? __eou__ No , it isn't mine . I blundered upon it under the sofa . Do you know whose watch it is ? __eou__ Let me have a look . It's mine . I have been looking for it , but just cannot find it . It's present from my father . __eou__ Well , here you are . Remember to put it in a proper place . __eou__
Who are we going to play with today ? __eou__ We are playing against Hainan . __eou__ Oh , the basketball team from No . 1 College ? I know they're a tough team . __eou__ Sure they are . __eou__ Who's winning ? __eou__ We are , 27 to 26 . __eou__ Really ? I thought that they'd been killing us by now . __eou__ How can it be ? We are a tough team as well . __eou__
Are you a smoker ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . __eou__ Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? __eou__ No . But my husband smokes 20 or more a day . __eou__ When did you begin to smoke ? __eou__ I had my first cigarette when I was 17 . __eou__ Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? __eou__ Yes . Twice . __eou__
How about the hiking ? It was freezing yesterday , are you all ok ? __eou__ Can ’ t be better , it was wonderful . We had a lot of fun there . There was so much joy and walk and breathe the winter air . We arrived at the park at 9 o ’ clock in the morning and didn ’ t leave till 3 o ’ clock in the afternoon . __eou__ You had been walking for 6 hours , isn ’ t that boring ? __eou__ Of course not ! We built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . We went sliding on the nice hill . It was a real work out . At noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . Fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . You must come with us next time . I bet you will love it . __eou__ Well . You know I hate walking , but I can ’ t wait to see your guys ’ video . __eou__
You know them ? __eou__ No , but those guys like to hit on me . __eou__
Here we are , Ryan ! This is where we're going to celebrate ! __eou__ It's a ETV palace ! I'm glad I brought my platinum card . __eou__ You won't need it . Stanley , my best man , is going to treat everybody ! __eou__ Where is Stanley ? It was his idea to have the bachelor's party at a ETV , wasn't it ? __eou__ If it were up to Stanley , we'd have the wedding in the ETV ! He loves to sing . __eou__ Then I bet he's really good ! __eou__ Well , uh , I'll let you decide that for yourself . He'll be here a little later . Here's our room ! __eou__
What a nice dress , Jean.You look marvelous ! __eou__ You , too . Where did you get your new hat ? __eou__ From the Crown's . Oh , what lovely earrings you have ! Are they diamond ? __eou__ Yes . It's a birthday present from my husband ! __eou__ Well , you are lucky to have such a considerate husband . Mine hasn't brought me a single rose since we married . __eou__ He'll come out with surprises . Just wait and see . Look at that woman , with the white chiffon ! __eou__ She's chic , isn't she ? __eou__ Yes . I like the dress . It must be the latest fashion . Look , the hem has lowered , and the waist narrowed . __eou__ It makes me feel rather shabby . That woman has a good taste in dressing , I would say . __eou__ Yes . She dressed with an individual flair . I rather envy her . __eou__ Most women follow fashion like sheep.They don't know any better than imitate . __eou__ I quite agree with you.See the woman there ? I dare say she hasn't got any eyes . How could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? And all that jewelry ! __eou__ The gown is quite expensive , believe me . __eou__ So what ? It only makes her look cheap and vulgar . __eou__ You know those upstarts . They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon . __eou__ You're quite slim . In fact , if you were one of those starlets , the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure . __eou__ Thanks . I'm flattered . __eou__ Oh , my shoes pinch me . Let's find a seat and sit a while . __eou__
Whoa , whoa , what ’ s going on ? Watch out ! __eou__ Hey , watch where you ’ re going ! __eou__ Oh , no ! I ’ m so sorry ! Are you all right ? __eou__ Oh ...

Please accept my apologies . __eou__ Oh , wait a second , you seem really familiar , I think I know you from somewhere . __eou__ Yeah , I think we have met somewhere before . That ’ s right ! We met at Aaron ’ s place last weekend ! What a coincidence ! But anyway , I ’ m glad to see that you ’ re not too badly hurt , and I should probably get going .

I finally saved enough and did everything at once . __eou__ Good for you ! You ’ Ve got new curtains too . That ’ s a very nice shade of blue . This sofa is very comfortable . I could sit on it all day ! __eou__ Do you like my carpet ? Be honest ! Tell me what you really think . __eou__ To be honest , it looks like your old carpet .

People of different races are fit for quite different sports . For instance , Asians are especially good fattable tennis , badminton , diving and shooting . They seem to have been born with certain natural endowments in technical sports , in which flexibility , agility and quick reflexes are favorable . __eou__ And a typical example has been the Chinese athletes at the Beijing Olympics , right ? __eou__ Yes , in all these four sports . the Chinese Olympic dream teams led the way . They swept the floor against their opponents in table tennis and diving . __eou__ Then what are the Westerners fit for ? __eou__ I think they are in a better position in those sports that demand a high degree of intensity , speed and explosive force like swimming , field games , etc . __eou__ Where do you think the edge is for black athletes ? __eou__ It's common sense that African athletes always make a clean sweep in track events , middle or long distance races , relays , hurdles , barriers , and marathon . __eou__ I got you .

I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would b __eou__ how many TVs would your dream home have ? __eou__ I think TV is a great waste of time , so I would only have one small TV in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning . __eou__

You will not run your car without fuel , and yet you expect your body to work without food . __eou__ I never thought about it that way . __eou__ I bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch TV or read a book . Then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat . __eou__ Oh doctor , I feel so foolish . __eou__ Way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits . __eou__ I know doctor , thank you so much . __eou__

The prices are very low . But you may find faulty products here too . __eou__ Faulty products ? __eou__ Yes .

I think we should home school our children when we decide to have kids . __eou__ What ? Why ? __eou__ Well , our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive . I have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages . __eou__ Like what ? I think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction . __eou__ Well , first of all , I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way .

What should I get Uncle Teddy ? __eou__ You could get him a tie . __eou__ Are you kidding ? That's the stupidest gift one can buy . I don't want to get a tie . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Everybody gets men ties for Christmas . It's too boring . Everybody buys either ties or sweaters . I want a more unique gift . __eou__ Well , you can buy him a pet iguana then . __eou__ That's a cool idea . At least it would be a surprise.But I'm afraid he wouldn't take care of it . __eou__ He would think you were crazy , Caroline . __eou__ Yes . An iguana is too strange for a gift , and a tie is too normal.So I have to find something halfway between . __eou__ How much do you want to spend ? __eou__ Well , he was very good to me.He helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest.So I want to spend at least 75 dollars . __eou__ Alright , I have an idea.You know he carries that conservative-looking briefcase every day . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Well , he isn't a lawyer , so I don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that . __eou__ What should he have then ? __eou__ I think he would appreciate having a very fine leather bag.But more like a workbag or shoulder bag.You know , not so hard and square like a briefcase . __eou__ I think that's a great idea . Men look great with that kind of bag.Where can we buy one ? __eou__ I don't think this mall has a leather goods store.So we have to go to State Street . __eou__ Alright . We can go later then . __eou__ We can buy something for Mom and Dad here , and then go buy Uncle Teddy's gift on State Street . __eou__ Good plan . What should we get for Mom though ? __eou__ She said she wants one of those automatic foot massagers . I think they sell them at Sears . __eou__ Alright . We can go check at Sears and see if they have them.And what about Dad ? __eou__ How about the iguana ? __eou__ I think it would be a great joke.But I know we'd have to take the iguana back . And the pet store might not let us.So why don't we get him something else ? Some clothes maybe . __eou__ A tie ? __eou__ Oh , shut up about ties ! Forget about ties , why not ? __eou__ I was just kidding . __eou__

so , your friend ’ s getting married on Saturday . What have you bought her as a wedding gift . I find is so hard to choose the right gift . __eou__ my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name b __eou__ that ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ? __eou__ most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help __eou__ so , what did you get them ? __eou__ I bought a sewing machine . I know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems . __eou__ what ’ s wrong with is ? __eou__ she says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . When she uses it , it makes a funny noise . __eou__ household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays . __eou__ I think it ’ s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . Because they know that we will buy the new models , the appliances don ’ t need to last more than five or ten year __eou__

Mr . Liu , would you like to have some chicken ? __eou__ Thank you . This is my first time to come to a Chinese restaurant .

The demographic reports are in ... From the looks of it , we're going to have to re-evaluate some of the content for our promotional events in different venues . __eou__ Why , what's the lowdown ? __eou__ According to the report , our Boston crowd is quite different make-up from our Chicago folks . Our Boston consumers are mostly from mid-level to upper-class income levels , university or postgraduates , married no children , white collar ... You know the kind . Chicago on the other hand is mostly mid to low income levels , single parent homes , blue collar ... I think we're talking about two totally different target groups . __eou__ I have no idea there was that great of deviation between the two venues ... To make our products sell , we have to take the target audience into account . __eou__ No kidding . We've got to come up with two completely different sales pitches to suit the needs of each groups . __eou__

My computer isn ’ t running at the same speed it used to be , it is testing my patience everyday . Can you tell me how to make it run faster ? __eou__ If you want to speed up your system , you ’ Ve got to clean it up first . __eou__ How ? __eou__ You need to free your disk space . The simplest way is to use a Disk-Cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . Things should be fine next time you start . You also need to control what starts up . There is a program calls Start-up Delayer , It can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after Windows boosts . For example , you can choose to set your Fox Mail program to load 30 seconds after Windows starts up . __eou__ Very useful advice , I will try them right now . __eou__

My boss would never do that . __eou__ let ’ s get back to you . How was your day ? __eou__ it was horrible ! It was just one thing after another . __eou__ you look pretty upset . Are you ok ? __eou__ I ’ m fine . But I have bad news . __eou__ what ’ s that ? __eou__ I got sacked today . __eou__ you ’ re kidding ! How did that happen ? __eou__ well , I was late to work today . It was the third time I was late this week . __eou__ how late were you ? __eou__ only about 5 minutes . __eou__ you got fired for being a few minutes late ? __eou__ my boss is really picky about that .

I can see by your resume here that you studied business administration . __eou__ That's right . __eou__ So I wonder why you want to work for a newspaper . __eou__ I did reporting for the university newspaper in my school.And I always be very interested in journalism . __eou__ But journalism , it is a very different profession from administration.You know a lot about administration.Why don't you choose to work for a company looking for managers ? __eou__ I study the administration.Yes.But I'm more attracted to writing articles . I want to use my knowledge of business to write financial news . __eou__ A new reporter must expect to work many hours . __eou__ I know that starting reporters work many hours . I'm very willing to take on the challenge . __eou__

What's wrong ? __eou__ I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode . __eou__ You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her . __eou__ The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me . __eou__ They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's " chi " . __eou__ But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ? __eou__ The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options . __eou__ Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up . __eou__ This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable . __eou__ Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more . __eou__ This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it . __eou__ Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap . __eou__

Good morning . Your ticket and passport , please ? __eou__ Here you are . __eou__ Do you have any baggage to check in ? __eou__ Yes , one box . __eou__ Would you please put it on the scale ? __eou__ OK . By the way , can you tell me how many kilos of free baggage each passenger is allowed ? __eou__ The baggage allowance is different according to the class of your ticket . What class are you travelling ? __eou__ First-class . __eou__ For a first-class passenger , the free baggage allowance is forty kilos . __eou__ How many pieces of baggage can I carry on to the plane ? __eou__ Passengers holding first class tickets may carry 2 pieces within the total weight of 5 kg onto the plane . __eou__ If my baggage exceeds the allowance , what should I do ? __eou__ If the checked baggage is over the allowance , we will charge you for the overweight . __eou__ I see . Thank you very much for your information . __eou__ You're welcome . Your boarding pass and baggage check , please . __eou__ Goodbye ! __eou__

It was a challenge for a person with a finance background . I met with the technical people and discussed the possibilities and obstacles .

Have you had a chance to look over the contract ? __eou__ Yes . I've read it carefully . __eou__ And do you have any questions ? __eou__ No . But the contract stipulates that I will teach 22 hours a week.Will you have thatmany classes for me right away ? __eou__ No , probably not . For the first two weeks you may teach 10 or 15 hours . __eou__ But my salary will be 1100 dollars a month.Will you pay me that much for the first month ? Because , I mean , I won't be working so many hours . __eou__ I understand . That's why I didn't write the date on the contract.For the first two weeks , we will pay you according to the hours you teach.When you have 22 hours of classes , then the contract will take effect.Is that alright with you ? __eou__ Oh , so I don't sign the contract today . Is that right ? __eou__ I don't want you to misunderstand , Miss Briggs.We are very serious about hiring you .

I've prepared the contract just so that you understand everything.So that you understand the terms . __eou__ I understand.And according to the terms on the contract , I am happy to accept this job .

I've been learning to play go recently . It's an amazing game ! __eou__ Weigh ? It must be a greatest Chinese invention . I've tried hard to learn it . Its rules can't be any simpler , but I've never won a game of Go . Well , it's all Greek to me ! __eou__ At least you have obtained a very basic understanding of the game , haven't you ? I think it is perfect for boosting intelligence , cultivating personality and flexible learning . Every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into Chinese culture should learn to play Go . __eou__ I heard it is included in the four major arts of China , is it ? __eou__ Sure . It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . I think weigh is the most fantastic of them . It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness . __eou__ I know it is quite different from Western chess . __eou__ Yes . Playing chess is a very aggressive experience . All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . Whenever I start a chess game , I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill . __eou__ But isn't it the same with wiki ? __eou__ Certainly not . The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent . In other words , each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board . Hence , chess aims to kill , while weigh is most concerned with howso survive . __eou__
Now I'm sure we'll never get all our things back . They're so clever these criminals . What's the point of collecting beautiful things for other people to steal ? __eou__ I only wish it were this time yesterday . __eou__ Think how happy we were . Now this.Things always go wrong . __eou__ Perhaps we ought to get dressed and have breakfast . We'd feel better . __eou__ I don't feel like breakfast . I don't feel like anything . Why are we so unlucky ? It's as if there were a jinx on us . __eou__ Perhaps I'd better ring the police ... __eou__ Yes . Of course . But what good will it do ? That man's miles away from here by now . In our car . __eou__

It's such a nice day outside . Let ’ s take a walk into town and do some window-shopping . __eou__ You know I hate shopping more than anything else in this world . __eou__ I know . But we could get some exercise in , and we could get some errands run , too . Window-shopping won ’ t cost you anything . __eou__ What kind of errands do we need to run ? __eou__ Well , we could go to the newsagent's to pick up the Sunday paper , go to the butcher's to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist's to pick up your prescription from the doctor . __eou__ I'll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight . __eou__ Fine , we'll do that on the way home , so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time . __eou__ Sounds good . You have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . I know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms , especially if the stores have special offers . __eou__ I promise . We're only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven ’ t had time for . __eou__ Ok , let's go then ! __eou__ Do you have any money ? __eou__ For what ? __eou__ For our errands , and maybe a little extra for something from a vendor on the street . __eou__ You said you were only going to window shop ! __eou__ I agreed to not go into the mall , but I can still look at things in the market ! __eou__ I should have known ... __eou__
Even with volume sales our costs for the Exec User won't go down much . __eou__ Just what are you proposing ? __eou__ We could take a cut on the price . But 25 % would reduce much our profit margin . We suggest a compromise 10 % . __eou__ That's a big change from 25 % ! 10 % is beyond my negotiating limit . Any other ideas ? __eou__ I don't think I can change it right now . Why don't we talk again tomorrow ? __eou__ Sure . I have to talk to my office anyway . I hope we can find some common ground on this . __eou__ Robert , I have been instructed to reject the numbers you proposed , but we can try to come up with something else . __eou__ I hope so , Dana . My instructions are to negotiate hard on this deal , but I'm trying very hard to reach some middle ground . __eou__ I understand . We propose a structured deal . For the first six months , we get a discount of 20 % and the next six months we get 15 % . __eou__ Dana . I can't bring those numbers back to my office , they'll turn it down flat . __eou__ Then you'll have to think of something better , Robert . __eou__

We've got a problem ... it looks like we'll need more spotlights on the exhibition booth . The client thinks it's too dark , and they want to add halogen lighting . We've already got 3 sets of track lighting from you guys , do you think you could help us out and throw in some halogens ? __eou__ Oh ... Um ... I don't think so . you know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system . Plus I'm going to have to call in some guys to install it for you . That's not going to come cheap . __eou__ But it would only be adding to the existing structure . We're not talking about anything new here ... __eou__ It doesn't matter because we will still have to call the electrician out , and they are union labor . It'll cost you a pretty penny ... __eou__ How much do you think it would cost ? __eou__ Mumm , I estimate it'll run in the neighborhood of ... $ 500 per light . __eou__ $ 500per light ? ! That's ridiculous ! It can't possibly be that expansive ! __eou__ It is , I'll tell you why . We'll have to call in the electrician , he's going to charge overtime now because it's already 5PM , and it will probably take him an hour a light . Plus , the halogen lights take more electricity , so your electrical cost is going to be higher as well . __eou__ Can't you give me a break on this ? We've already spent so much money on lighting , I hate to have to blow so much more on halogens . __eou__ No , that's the cost , and that's what it's going to cost us . We can't go in the hole with this . I am giving you my best price , so take it , or leave it . __eou__

I know you want to be polite but you've already made contact with them , so in English you can be more relaxed in the opening ... __eou__ Okay , more relaxed . Got it . Hey , Sally , what ' s up ? It's Tracy here , just . __eou__ Okay Tracy , now it's too relaxed ! You've still got to show some respect . How about starting with " Dear Ms . Cooper , I'm writing to confirm ... ? __eou__ Great , okay . " Dear Miss Cooper , I'm writing to confirm the final quotation for the full page back cover color advertisement you requested for the spring issue of Voila magazine " . __eou__ That's great ... __eou__ " The final costing , including advert design and production , comes to forty-five thousand six hundred RIB . We want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . Thanks for ... " __eou__ Woo , okay , back up a second , Tracy . That's too direct . Can I suggest you say , please note that final payment is due two working weeks before publication ? You don't want to offend her . __eou__ Oops , okay . You are right .

It ’ ll be easier to work through them that way . __eou__
Why have you decided to change jobs ? __eou__ I hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field.Since my major was international banking , I really hope to work at a bank . __eou__ Then , why do you want to work for our bank since it's a new establishment in Shanghai ? __eou__ Because your bank is a new one , I think I'll be given more opportunities , and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here . __eou__ It certainly is . But the work is also hard here . You need to put a lot of hard hours on the job to succeed in this field . __eou__ I expect to work hard , madam . __eou__ Do you mind going on frequent business traps ? __eou__ No , I enjoy travelling . __eou__
Excuse me.sir . Can I have look at the timetable please ? __eou__ Surely of course.Here you are . __eou__ Is flight ZW203 a direct one ? __eou__ No , it stopped at Honolulu.Would you like to book one ? __eou__ No . Is there any direct flight to New York ? __eou__ Let me see . I am sorry . ZW203 is the only one to New York . __eou__
I am looking for a pan . __eou__ No problem . What size would you like ? __eou__ A big one would be nice . __eou__ How about this one ? It's our biggest — 16 ' in diameter . __eou__ Oh , yes , I like that one , but it's too heavy . __eou__ Okay , try this one . It's made of aluminum . __eou__ Oh , yes ! This is much better . But it has an aluminum handle . __eou__ Here you go . Same pan , but with a state-of-the-art , heat-resistant plastic handle . __eou__ Yes . That's perfect . I'll take it . __eou__ Great . Will that be cash or charge ? __eou__ Oh , wait a minute . What about a lid for the pan ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I forgot to show you the lid . It comes with the pan . __eou__

Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something . __eou__ Just give me a second . I'll be right up . I ran a virus scan on your computer , and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files ! __eou__ But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing theinternet , I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus . __eou__ Well , you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly , yours wasn't up to date , that ’ s probably what was causing your problems . __eou__ Ok . Anything else ? __eou__ Yeah , try not to kick or hit the computer ! __eou__ Um yeah . Sorry about that . __eou__

Have you heard the news ? __eou__ I haven't heard anything . __eou__ Deborah had her baby last week . __eou__ Nobody told me . __eou__ I thought you heard . __eou__ I really wasn't told anything . __eou__ She was a cute 8 pounds 6 ounces . __eou__ Wow , how exciting . __eou__ I know , you should really go and see her and the baby . __eou__ Of course I will . __eou__ I just wanted to let you know what happened . __eou__ I appreciate that . __eou__
I'm afraid it's bad news for you . You haven't got the position . __eou__ Oh , no ! I can't have failed . Are you sure ? __eou__ I'm afraid so . I'm terribly sorry . __eou__ It sucks . But Arden told me he's satisfied with my qualifications and experience . __eou__ He's the only one of the several to decide this . __eou__ How am I going to face the fellows in our office ? They thought I would be promoted . They must be waiting for my good news . __eou__ I don't think the thing can be that serious . You should face the result .

What is your most preferred training method ? __eou__ Well , I prefer active rather than passive training . For example , I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin . They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice . All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room , so we could communicate with each other . We had a lot of fun learning together . It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues . __eou__ Well , that is also very efficient , right ? __eou__ Of course , it is much better than just giving us some reading materials or information via the internet . __eou__ That ’ s boring . Once we were asked to watch a video on how to operate the punches , all of us seemed to fall into sleep by the end of the video . __eou__
what are you watching on the telly ? __eou__ there's a great sitcom on Channel 3 that stars in about three minutes . __eou__ which one is that ? __eou__ the office .

I think it's a hilarious show . __eou__ what are you watching now ? __eou__ they're just showing highlights of American Idol from last night right now . __eou__ I can't stand American Idol ! I think it's really over-rated . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . __eou__ have you got satellite , cable , or digital TV ? __eou__ we have digital TV . It's amazing though---even with 100 channels , there's often nothing on that I'd want to watch ! __eou__ do you watch a lot of TV then ? __eou__ I guess so . I'm bit of a couch potato . How about you ? __eou__ I don't have a TV at home , so I rarely watch anything . Is there anything worth watching after the office ? __eou__ there's actually a documentary on the history channel later on that I'd like to watch . Do you want to stay and watch it with me ? __eou__ why not ? I don't have anything better to do ! __eou__
Good afternoon , ma'am . Can I help you find anything ? __eou__ No , thanks . I'm just looking . __eou__ We have a special on these skirts this week . Would you like to try one on ? __eou__ No , thank you . I don't need any skirts . __eou__ How about a blouse ? This one here is the latest fashion . __eou__ No , thank you . __eou__ Why not try on this lovely pair of shorts ? I'm sure they'd look fabulous on you . __eou__ No doubt . Look , I'm just browsing . If I need your help , I'll let you know . __eou__ Take a look at this dress ! Don't you think it's perfect for you , ma'am ? Uh , where are you going , ma'am ? Ma'am ? __eou__
You say your products are aimed at the green consumer . In what ways are they environmentally-friendly ? __eou__ We produce household cleaning products - detergents and so on .

Also , all our bottles are made of recyclable plastic and we use recycled fibre in our boxes . That's what our customers want . __eou__
Excuse me , Alex ? __eou__ What can I do for you , Kim ? __eou__ I was wondering if you could get together with me to go over the payroll . __eou__ Sure , anytime . __eou__
I don't know about you , but I'm famished . Are you interested in getting a bite to eat ? __eou__ That sounds great . I'm absolutely starving ! What kind of food are you in the mood for ? __eou__ I'd love something spicy . Maybe we could get some Sichuan Hotpot . __eou__ You're a woman after my own heart . I don't know many people who can handle spicy food . Are you sure you are up for hotpot . __eou__ Sure . If I could , I would eat hotpot every day ! __eou__ Ok , you're really all eyes when it comes to talking about food , aren't you ? __eou__ Well , let's stop dragging our feet and find a Sichuan Hotpot restaurant for dinner ! __eou__ Let me think about it for a minute . Let's see ... oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue ! Give me a second and it'll come to me . __eou__ Well ... ? Have you thought of it yet ? __eou__ No ... __eou__ Never mind . There's an authentic tasting hotpot restaurant not far from the China World Trade Towers on Chang An Street . Have you been there ? __eou__ That's it ! That's the one I was thinking of ! I told you I'd remember it ! __eou__ You really have a bid head , don't you ! __eou__
I lost my wallet . __eou__ I'm sorry , that's bad luck . __eou__
Can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little ? __eou__ Sure . If you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . It ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective . __eou__ I need to excise my arms too . How can I do that ? __eou__ One good way is to do push-ups . Another way is to use weights . Make sure you grip the weights firmly . You don ’ t want to drop them on your feet ! __eou__ When I do push-ups , should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ? __eou__ You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important think is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend their bodies at the waist , which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise . __eou__ What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ? __eou__ One that I recommend is that you lie on your back . You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out either side of your body . __eou__ So I need plenty of space for this exercise . __eou__ Yes , you do . Lift the weight up , keeping your arms straight all the time . __eou__ Great . Thanks for you advice ! __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , could you cash these travaler's check for me , please ? __eou__ Sure.Please sign your name here ... and here . __eou__ Ok , here you are . __eou__ Thanks.How would you like them ? __eou__ It doesn't matter . __eou__
Room reservations . Can I help you ? __eou__ Hello , is there a room available ? __eou__ What kind of room do you have in mind ? __eou__ A twin room , please . __eou__ Hold on , please . ... I'm afraid we're fully booked.The only room available at the moment is a suite . __eou__ Oh , I see . Thank you anyway . __eou__
Look , who's here , Peter ! __eou__ Oh , Tom ! I thought you were in Paris . __eou__ Just got back.Good to see you ! __eou__ Good to see you too ! __eou__
Are you going to the annual party ? I can give you a ride if you need one . __eou__ Thanks a lot . That's the favor I was going to ask you for . __eou__ The pleasure is mine . __eou__
Tristan , could you stay a few extra minutes to discuss your project with me ? __eou__ Sure . We're on a pretty tight schedule , but we should be able to finish it just on time . __eou__ Are all of your team members on schedule ? __eou__ A few of the graphic designers are a bit behind in their work because of computer problems . __eou__ How have they decided to deal with that ? __eou__ They've agreed to work over-time until it's finished . They've even decided to come in on the weekend . __eou__ That's true dedication . I'm impressed . When is it due ? __eou__ We agreed that the deadline was next Friday . __eou__ Right . Well , given that your colleagues are working so hard on this project , I suppose we could change that deadline to Monday morning , I won't have time to look over it on the weekend anyway . __eou__ That'd be very helpful . An extra weekend is all they really need . Thanks . __eou__ That's alright . Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the new deadline . __eou__ I will . __eou__ I know you have a tight schedule , so I won't take up more of your time . Have a good evening . __eou__ You , too ! See you tomorrow . __eou__

Maybe tomorrow . __eou__
Well , tell me something of yourself . __eou__ What would you like to know , Mr . Green ? __eou__ What working experience have you got ? __eou__ In 2004 , I got a job in the sales department of a trading company near Guangzhou . I started a sales representative . A year later , I was promoted to the position of sales manager . I had that job ever since , which is just over a year now . __eou__ Oh , good . Irene , can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant ? Don't you like your present job ? __eou__ Frankly , some part of it I enjoy very much , but I prefer something more professional . It happens that I have a friend working here in this company .

I don't know what to do.Could you tell me what should I do before an interview ? __eou__ sure , you should prepare so that you can give proper response when you're being interviewed . __eou__ yeah , besides my personal introduction , what else should I prepare ? __eou__ you should collect as much information about the company and the position you're applying for as you can .

What's your ideal boss ? __eou__ I have had an incredible boss , who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience . A-bout two months after I began working for her , she really let me spread my wings . She encouraged me to work independently , because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment . So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day . Of course , I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports , although she didn't specifically ask me to . Without her support and encouragement , I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time . But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change . I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs . And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described , I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone . __eou__
Hello . I'm leaving . Here is my key . __eou__ Just one second , sir , and I'll give you your receipt . Here you go . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ Sir , did you enjoy your stay here ? __eou__ Well , most of my time here was pleasant . And New York itself is fantastic . __eou__ I'm glad you enjoyed the city , anyway . But please don't think too unkindly of us . __eou__
Wow ! What ’ s the hold up ? __eou__ It ’ s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . Nobody sticks around in the summer . __eou__ Really ? Then , I guess I won ’ t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ? __eou__ Actually , you might because there ’ s a big convention in town this weekend . __eou__ I ’ m not too worried about it . I always seem to find something . __eou__
What do you think a job means to you ? __eou__ It is a way to make a living , but beyond this it's a way of fulfilling one's development .

We will need that number if you need to make a claim . __eou__ OK , I'd like to purchase 500 US dollars worth of Traveller's Cheques , please . __eou__

Now please tell me something about your past work achievements . __eou__ All right , madam . When I was sales manager at the Beijing Friendship Store . I succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent . __eou__ That is quite an achievement !

I got the title of Advance Worker in 2006 . __eou__ Do you have any publications ? __eou__ Yes .

Catherine , have you ever seen the movie Fast Food Nation ? __eou__ Yes , I remember it was inspired by a New York Times best-seller of the same name . __eou__ It's very thought-provoking , isn't it ? __eou__ Exactly . It reveals the dark side of the all-American meal . __eou__ So what do you think of the American fast food culture ? __eou__ I think America really deserves the name of " fast food nation - as people can find McDonald ' s , KFC and Pizza Hut almost all over the States . __eou__ And everyone knows that Americans ' favorite food is the hamburger , isn't it ? __eou__ Sure . You see , Tom , fast food is a lifestyle that craves convenience . People just don't care whether it is healthy or not . __eou__ But I think some healthy menu options are also served at fast food restaurants .. __eou__ What are they ? __eou__ Such as fat-free milk , whole-wheat rolls and fish sandwich . __eou__ They're much better __eou__ But I'm not sure if they're well-rcceived . __eou__ That's the point . People usually don't have much time to think about it when they have a on-the-go meal . __eou__ Well , Americans may need to find a way to make the most of their fast foods . __eou__ I suppose so . __eou__
You ran into my car . __eou__ That was my fault .

We would be happy to cash it for you . __eou__ I was going to cash it at the hotel , but one of my friends said that banks always give better exchange rates . __eou__ Well , any bank will cash it at our present traveler's check buying rate , for which we ’ re somewhere cheaper than hotels because of the service charge . You see , hotels really aren ’ t in the money exchange business although they will cash traveler ’ s check for their guest . __eou__ You mean there is really not that much of a difference . __eou__ No , madam . Not very much . __eou__ Well , may I cash these three checks for 100 dollars each ? I think that will be enough . __eou__ Yes , I'll be happy to cash these for you . Would you please countersign them here ? __eou__ Ok . __eou__

Which services offered by your band do you use most ? __eou__ I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money form once currency t __eou__ Do you ever ask you bank for traveller's cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around . __eou__ I sometimes use traveller's cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash . __eou__ Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit . __eou__ Yes , I do . It saves me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines . __eou__ That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too . __eou__ Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others . __eou__ I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher . __eou__ I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use . __eou__ That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain . __eou__
Rose , is this you ? __eou__ Yes , what is up ? __eou__ This is Susan .

It's so earlier this morning , Mr . Li ! You just came back yesterday , you should have rest much more . __eou__ I'd like to have rest , but I have many things to do . __eou__ How about this post-trip ? __eou__ It's very good , and the result isn't too bad . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Of course . I will write a report about this post-trip , and then you'd better type it at the moment , OK ? __eou__ OK , it's no problem . __eou__ ( Afternoon ) Miss Liu . Are you typing my report ? __eou__ Yes , what can I do for you ? __eou__ Nothing . I just tell you take care of it when you type , especially the address and telephone number of those new guests . You should make sure that it's no mistaken . __eou__ OK , please don't worry about it . You should set your mind at rest . __eou__ Ha , I know you are great secretary . __eou__ Thanks your flatter . __eou__
I'm pleased to meet you again , Mrs . King . __eou__ Pleased to see you , too , Mr . Brown . __eou__ You've had a good trip , I hope . __eou__ Yes , a very pleasant journey , thank you . __eou__ It's been a full two years since we last saw each other . __eou__ So it is , I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years . __eou__ We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement . __eou__ I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products . __eou__ Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end . __eou__ That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ? __eou__ 500 pieces . __eou__ No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts . __eou__ All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission . __eou__ I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged . __eou__ We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own . __eou__ No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction . __eou__ Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products . __eou__ Yes , we've already prepared one . I've brought it with me . I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow . __eou__ Good , that's all then . __eou__ Good . __eou__
I think we have had a very pleasant conversation , haven't we ? __eou__ Yes , I think so too . __eou__ Do you have any other questions ? __eou__ Let me think ... I want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee . __eou__ I'm sorry we can't now . __eou__ I really hope that your company could provide living places ; otherwise I have to rent a house to live . __eou__ Maybe the company will build dormitory for the employees in the future . __eou__ That would work too . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ Some companies will pay part of the phone bills for the employees . Will this company do so ? __eou__ I'm sorry we won't do so for a new employee . We only provide this benefit to employees who have made significant contributions to the company . __eou__ I understand . Will the company provide training ? __eou__ Yes , we will , and the staff will have a chance to travel every year . __eou__ That's great . Thank you very much . __eou__
Can I help you , sir ? __eou__ I'd like a table for two , please . __eou__ Do you have a reservation , sir ? __eou__ No , I'm afraid not . Can I sit over there ? There's a table free by the window . __eou__ Sorry , sir . That table has been reserved . This way , please . How about this one , sir ? __eou__ Fine . I'll sit here . __eou__ Would you like some drinks ? __eou__ I'll have a double whiskey on the rocks . __eou__
What ? What ’ s up ? __eou__ Our softball team is in the finals ! We ’ re playing the McGrath office on Saturday . __eou__ Fantastic ! I ’ ll be there ! __eou__

So , Emily , how was your day ? __eou__ I don't think you really want to hear about it . __eou__ It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it . __eou__ To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck ! __eou__ Why ? What happened ? __eou__ Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! __eou__ That's not very fair . What did you do ? __eou__ There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired me for sure . __eou__ Does he treat everyone in your department like this ? __eou__ He treats everyone pretty badly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! __eou__ Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ? __eou__ I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! __eou__ Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at your company ? __eou__ Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion . __eou__ That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders . __eou__ I try to be sensible about it , but it's not very easy . Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it . __eou__ That's so true . When you have a taste for success , you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way . __eou__
I was wondering if someone in your office could help me with a question I have about my payment . __eou__ I would be happy to answer any questions you might have . __eou__ My paycheck seems to be smaller than the one I received last week . __eou__ What about income ? Did you make any money during that period ? __eou__ My old employer gave us a couple days of work during that period . __eou__ When you filled out your Continued Claim Form , did you show that income ? __eou__ Of course I wrote down the work that I had done on the Continued Claim Form . __eou__ What happens is , when you make money , we take part of your benefits away . __eou__ I am not going to show any income from now on then . __eou__ I wouldn ’ t do that if I were you .

Jane ! What an enchanting skirt you have on ! __eou__ Thank you ! Guess how much it costs . __eou__ Bright colors , smooth material , exquisite craftsmanship , soft lines ... Darling , it looks elegant on you ! It can't be any cheap stuff . Something around two hundred , I guess . __eou__ Your offer is way off the mark . It set me back only sixty-five . __eou__ Then you got a windfall ! Was sixty-five the original price , or did you get a special discount ? __eou__ Neither . I drove a hard bargain with the vendor before I got the price down . __eou__ How much did she ask for ? __eou__ Three hundred ! That's daylight robbery . How dare she play tricks on an old hand like me ? Without hesitation , I gave my offer---no more than fifty . __eou__ She must be fuming with anger at such a bid , wasn't she ? __eou__ Not at all ! She's really been around , and seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this . That's the trade . She only demanded a higher bid , saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy . She was lying ! Then I inquired , ' May I have it at sixty ? ' she waved her head . __eou__ Then you pretended to go without buying it ? __eou__ Yeah . I turned around and started to move out . Just then , she yelped behind my back , ' all right , all right ! I may sacrifice a little . Let's fix it sixty-five ! Can't be cheaper . ' __eou__
How can we avoid the jam ? __eou__ Let's take a roundabout way . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Look , traffic jam again ! __eou__

I think if I ’ m going to find a job , I ’ ll look over the job board . __eou__ Well , there ’ s no doubt that lots of people have found employment in the help wanted section . __eou__ Right , so I picked up a copy of the Sunday Globe this morning . __eou__ Did you get a copy of the Herald too ? __eou__ No , why should I ? The Globe ’ s help wanted section is the best . __eou__ That ’ s true , but still the Herald lists some jobs the Globe doesn ’ t have . __eou__ Not enough to worry about . Why do I waste the money buying two papers ? __eou__ It's only a couple of dollars more . For that much money you can afford to risk it . __eou__ I guess you ’ re right . I'll get a Herald as soon as I finish looking over the Globe . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__
Mary , today a man from an intermediary gave me a call . __eou__ What did he say ? __eou__ He said he saw my job-seeking information on the Internet , and could offer me an appropriate job . __eou__ What kind of intermediary is it ? __eou__ It's a recruiting agency which specializes in introducing talented people to companies and businesses . __eou__ What job did he recommend to you ? __eou__ It's on telemarketing . __eou__ Does he ask you to pay some fees ? __eou__ No , he said the employers will pay for it . __eou__ Then what do you think about it ? __eou__ I feel it is OK and I want to give it a try . __eou__ Sure , but you must verify that first and don't easily make a promise . __eou__ Of course , I will . __eou__ Good luck ! __eou__
I have a parking ticket to pay for . __eou__ Did you bring your ticket ? __eou__ Yes , I remembered to bring my ticket with me today . __eou__ Did you bring your ID ? __eou__ I didn't bring my ID . __eou__ You're going to need your ID to pay the ticket . __eou__ What do you need my ID for ? __eou__ We have to know that this ticket is really yours . __eou__ All right , I see what you mean . __eou__ Next time you come back , bring your ID . __eou__ Will everything be cleared from my record ? __eou__ Yes , everything will be cleared . __eou__
Here's the dress you wanted it to be made . __eou__ Oh , dear ! __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ It's not what I asked for . __eou__ What's wrong with it ? __eou__ It's not the right material . Or the right color . I can't possibly accept it . __eou__ This is a pity ! __eou__
Can I help you , sir ? __eou__ Yes , please . I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife . __eou__ What kind of presents do you want ? __eou__ Actually , I don't know exactly . Do you have anything recommended ? __eou__ OK . How about some very cool sneakers for your children ? Anyway , it won't cost you much . It's only around $ 59.95 for each pair . It might be cheaper than that in America . __eou__ Hey , How did you know I came from America ? __eou__ Just a hunch , sir . __eou__ How much again ? __eou__ $ 59.95 . __eou__ That's really cheap for shoes like those . OK , I'll take 5 pairs . __eou__ Sorry , sir . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Because in this duty-free shop , your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife . __eou__ Oh , my God . I've totally forgotten about that . Anyway , I think she would like a bottle of perfume . __eou__ That's good . And I can also recommend you a good one . It's the brand of DENY . __eou__ DENY ? That's very expensive in America . It costs nearly $ 70 for only 50ml.DKNY ? __eou__ It's $ 60 here . __eou__ That's very unbelievable . Is it fake ? __eou__ Of course not , sir . __eou__ OK , I'll take one . __eou__
Ouch , it ’ s unbearable . __eou__ Please keep calm . I know the pain isn ’ t what flesh and blood can stand . But be brave . __eou__ All right , doctor . But it really hurts . __eou__
Your office called and said that the owners had made a counter-offer to my offer to purchase their house . __eou__ To your offer of three hundred and twenty thousand dollars , the owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars . __eou__ I think that maybe I should accept their offer . __eou__ You , of course , have two ways of responding . You can say yes or come up with another offer . __eou__ I want to make another offer , but I am afraid that they will decline and I will lose this house . __eou__ There is always a chance that someone could outbid you , but you could try one more offer if you like . __eou__ I would now like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter-offer . __eou__ After the owners get home from work tonight , I will approach them with your offer . __eou__ Can you tell me how long it will take them to get back to me ? __eou__ I don ’ t think that it will take as long as the response to the first offer . __eou__
You heard who won the election , right ? __eou__ Who was elected ? __eou__ McCain won the election . __eou__ That can ’ t be true ! __eou__ I ’ m upset , too . __eou__ I can ’ t believe people voted for him . __eou__ People must want him as our President . __eou__ That doesn ’ t make any sense . __eou__ I have more bad news . __eou__ How could the news get any worse ? __eou__ I was only kidding , because Obama won the election . __eou__ That ’ s great news ! __eou__
When could we meet to discuss the project ? __eou__ I will be available on Monday or Tuesday . Choose which day is best for you . __eou__ I prefer Monday . __eou__ Good .

When you come , be prepared to do your presentation . __eou__ I will be prepared to do my presentation . __eou__ Who would you like to see there ? Just the sub-committee or should we ask the whole committee ? __eou__ Everyone needs to be there . __eou__ That will probably be best . Do you need help with directions ? __eou__ I think I know where it is . Maybe you could send me directions just to make sure . __eou__ OK . We will e-mail you all the information you need tomorrow . Have a good day ! __eou__

Do you want some dessert ? __eou__ No thanks . We just need our check . Have you seen the waitress ? __eou__ Where is our waitress anyway ? __eou__ Yes , the service hasn't been the best . Is that our waitress over there ? __eou__ I'll walk over and get the bill , since I don't think the waitress is coming over here any time soon . __eou__ Good idea . Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together . __eou__ So the bill is $ 36.00 . __eou__ How much do you think we should leave for a tip ? __eou__ My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip . __eou__ I agree , but we don't really know the whole story . There may have been problems in the kitchen beyond her control . __eou__ Let's leave 10 % , so that we at least leave something for the service . __eou__ I agree . We will leave $ 3.60 for the tip . __eou__
Hello ? __eou__ Hello ? Mr . Bernie . My name is Lisa . I hope I ’ m not disturbing you . I just heard about your daughter .

It makes me nervous . I can ’ t concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished . __eou__ What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? __eou__ For me , this would be having good relationships with my family members . My family has always been very close knit , and we still spend a lot of time together . __eou__ What basic principles do you apply to your life ? __eou__ Working hard and being frugal are both virtues . I strive to practise these two virtues in my life . __eou__
You look really wiped out ? __eou__ I had meetings back to back all morning . And phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office . __eou__ Not a good day . I hate to tell you that Mr . Thomas wants to see the profit ’ s statement for new project tomorrow morning . __eou__ I can ’ t believe it . I guess I ’ ll be here until 10 again tonight . __eou__
I'm having problems with my computer . __eou__ What's wrong with it ? __eou__ For some reason it won't turn on . __eou__ Have you checked the connections on your computer ? __eou__ What connections ? __eou__ There are cords that connect your computer to a power outlet . __eou__ Will the cords keep it from turning on ? __eou__ It won't turn on if the cords aren't connected . __eou__ I didn't think of that . __eou__ Try it and see if it works . __eou__ I think that I will , thanks . __eou__ It should work , but let me know if it doesn't . __eou__

I just go to sleep whenever I feel tired . __eou__ Have you been under a lot of stress lately ? __eou__ I just lost my job , and I am unsure about being able to find another one . __eou__ Have you ever tried doing relaxation exercises before you go to bed ? __eou__ I haven ’ t ever tried that , but it sounds like a good idea . __eou__
So how was your interview ? __eou__ I haven't gone to the interview yet . It's tomorrow . I am so nervous . __eou__ Don't worry . You should do fine . You have the experience . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__ Remember , they want someone who works well with people . You've got to show them how easy-going and personable you are . __eou__ Thanks , I'll keep that in mind . __eou__
How are you doing ? __eou__ I'm pretty good , you ? __eou__ I'm awesome . __eou__ How long have you been on the bus ? __eou__ I've been on here for like , 15 minutes . __eou__ Do you catch this bus a lot ? __eou__ Not much , I have a car . __eou__ So , you have your own car ? __eou__ I sure do . __eou__ Then , why are you on the bus with me ? __eou__ I'm waiting till our President gets out of office , and the gas prices go down . __eou__ That's good thinking . __eou__

How do you put this seat back ? I know there is a lever somewhere . __eou__ What are you doing ? __eou__ I'm getting dressed , what does it look like ? __eou__ It looks like you are about to get dressed .

can you help me pick out some fabric for a suit ? I'm going to get one made for a friend's wedding . __eou__ sure . What kind of material do you want for the suit to be made from ? __eou__ it depends on the price , but I was thinking of getting a wool / cashmere blend . __eou__ that will probably be quite expensive , but the more you pay for the fabric , the longer it'll last and the better it'll look . What color do you want the suit to be ? __eou__ I was thinking of a brown pin-striped suit . __eou__ brown , huh ? Isn't that a bit dull ? __eou__ haven't you heard ? Brown is the new black . __eou__ why don't you just get black ? Black suits are always fashionable and can be worn for anything — a funeral , a wedding , a job interview — anything ! __eou__ that may be true , but black is so boring . Anyway , I already have three black suits . I might as well get a suit that stands out from the rest . __eou__ here are two different shades of brown . Which one do you prefer ? __eou__ I like the one on the left , but I don't like the pattern on it . It's too much . I want a pattern that's a bit subtler . __eou__ how about this one ? __eou__ I think that will do . Let's go talk to the tailor about getting it made . __eou__ ok , let's go . __eou__
What do you think of your personality ? __eou__ I am quite alive and energetic . I am a curious person , and I like to learn new things . __eou__ Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? __eou__ I am quite outgoing , I think . __eou__ How do you get along with people whose characters are different from your own ? __eou__ I try to adapt myself . __eou__
Ok , I ’ Ve got an up-to-day map . Let ’ s check the route from here to the airport . __eou__ Where are we ? Oh , here we are . So we drive to the A120 and turn left . __eou__ No , we turn right . Remember that we are coming from this direction . __eou__ Oh yes ! Sorry ! Then we drive to the M11 motorway . __eou__ How far is that ? __eou__ It ’ s only seven miles . We turn left to join the motorway and drive south . __eou__ According to the map , we get off the M11 at the second junction and join the M25 . That ’ s the motorway that goes around the edge of London . __eou__ That ’ s another 15 miles , so that ’ s 22 miles total so far . __eou__ Then we drive west on the M25 . we must be careful to turn in the right direction ! __eou__ Then we drive on the M25 . it turns south . When we reach exit 15 , we turn left and go west along the M4 . __eou__ Then we take the first Heathrow Airport . What ’ s the total distance ? __eou__ The journey around the M25 is 33 miles and then 3 extra miles to get to the airport . So how many miles is that together ? __eou__ 22 miles to the M25 , 33 miles on the M25 , and 3 after that . That ’ s a total of 58 miles , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ It shouldn ’ t take us very long to cover that distance . Remember that we can go quite fast on the motor way . __eou__ We can only go fast on the motor ways if there isn ’ t much traffic . I think we should allow ourselves plenty of time to get there . Being early is much better than being late . __eou__
May I order , please ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ I would like sirloin steak and tomato salad . __eou__ Do you take dressing on your salad ? __eou__ Yes , blue Cheese please . __eou__

And I ’ Ve been awarded Zu Jingle Scholarship two times . __eou__ Besides your major , do you know some in other fields ? __eou__ Yes . To develop my knowledge , I studied Economics , Business Administration and Accounting through self-study . Nowadays , I have passed three courses on CPA . __eou__ Have you ever been a student leader ? __eou__ Yes , I used to be the monitor of my class . __eou__ Did it affect you much ? __eou__ It ’ s a very important experience for me . First , it improved my organizing ability , and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective . Second , it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who I like or dislike . __eou__

I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received __eou__ absolutely . With your expertise and experience , you're clearly working below your pay grade . __eou__ that's exactly why I decided to quit the job and find a new one . __eou__ this way , you'll earn more at the new work place . __eou__ that's right . I am not the only one who has done this . Job hopping is quite common in the IT industry . __eou__ that is to say , most IT professionals can get a pay rise more easily by changing a job than waiting for a rise . I'm wondering why IT companies are always willing to pay more to new employees instead __eou__
I want to take a photograph . __eou__ All right.Which kind do you prefer ? __eou__ I like one taken half length . __eou__ That's fine . __eou__

Cathy , I'd like to introduce the new microwave stove of mine to you , because it is easy to use . __eou__ OK , it so happened I want to buy one . __eou__ This microwave stove has many functions . Let me show you . For example , if you want to cook meat , you just need to put meat in it , and press the button with a picture of meat , that ’ s OK . After several minutes , you can eat the delicious meat . __eou__ I think it ’ s good , and it suits me , because I'm not good at cooking . Is it expensive ? __eou__ Oh , it is not so expensive . It only costs me 280 dollars . __eou__
We're supposed to check in at the Air China's counter 30 minutes before take-off , Joe . __eou__ Yes , I know . The boarding time on the ticket says 17:05 , and now it's 16:15 . I guess we have plenty of time . __eou__ Do we need to show our ID cards when checking in ? __eou__ Yes.It ' s essential . __eou__ What about our luggage ? __eou__ We can check it and hand carry the small bags . And we have to open each for inspection . __eou__ Are they going to frisk all the passengers ? __eou__ I think so.We certainly don't want a hijack to happen on the plane today . __eou__
I need some flowers for my wife . It's her birthday . __eou__ Very well . We have some fresh red roses . __eou__ How much are the roses ? __eou__ $ 20 per dozen . __eou__ That sounds like a good deal . __eou__ Yes , they're on sale today . __eou__ I'll take a dozen . __eou__ Splendid . Will there be anything else ? __eou__ No , the roses will be fine . __eou__ I'm sure your wife will love them . __eou__
Mom , I'm starving . __eou__ Here are some biscuits . Why are you back so early today ? __eou__ My teacher had a sudden stomachache , so the class was cut shot . You ? __eou__ Me what ? __eou__ You are cooking at least two hours earlier than the usual . __eou__ It's not for us . __eou__ Then it's for Dad , isn't it ? It's so unfair ! __eou__ Don't be a smarty-pants . It's for Grandma Wang . __eou__ What was that again ? __eou__ It's for Grandma Wang . She is sick and her only daughter went abroad weeks ago . So she needs our help . __eou__ I'm sorry , I didn't know that . But I wanna help . __eou__ Umm , let me think for a moment . We can meet her together after I finish cooking . __eou__ I'll get knee to knee with her . __eou__ Good boy . I can only imagine how happy she will be to see you . __eou__
I'm glad we came here . This is really delicious ! __eou__ I was worried you would think it was too far to drive . __eou__ Well , it's true I've never driven two hours just to get lunch.But really , I think it's worth it . __eou__ I think if you try some more authentic Chinese food , you might understand how we students from Taiwan suffer . __eou__ How do you mean " suffer " ? __eou__ I mean , in Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food.So we miss the food in Taiwan too much.Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better . __eou__ Even in the winter ? __eou__ Yes , even in the winter . __eou__ And even if it takes two hours , huh ? __eou__ Why not ? I've been craving good food for three weeks now . I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza ! __eou__ Well , this really is delicious , I have to admit . I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining . __eou__ Don't tease me ! Good food is really important to Chinese ! __eou__ I know . I can see that . This is what is called " dim sum , " right ? __eou__ Yes , all these dishes are different " dim sum " dishes.You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America . __eou__ So when you Chinese think of Chinatown , you mostly think of food . Is that right ? __eou__ Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too.Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment . __eou__ And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner , after the museum.Chicago has some great Italian restaurants . __eou__ No way ! __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ We're going up to the " new " Chinatown for dinner . I already know where we're going to go . __eou__ Alright , alright . I am happy to try more Chinese food.Will it be dim sum again ? __eou__ No , dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time , or sometimes closer to breakfast.We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the " new " Chinatown . __eou__ Taiwanese style ? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style ? __eou__ No , dim sum is more Cantonese style.But of course you can buy it in Taiwan . __eou__ I wonder if you can cook things this good . __eou__ I'm a great cook actually . You will see . __eou__
Pam , where's the closest ATM ? __eou__ It's not that far . Do you see that Yellow building over there ? __eou__ The big one or the small one ? __eou__ The big one . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ It's right next to it , on the right . __eou__ Do you know if there's a convenience store around here ? __eou__ I don't think there's one around here . The closest one is on 3rd street , but that's probably closed now . __eou__ I really need to get some things before I leave . __eou__ Well , you could go down to 22nd street . There are lot of stores down there that are open 24 hours a day . __eou__ Can I take the subway to get there ? __eou__ Yes , but that'll probably take about half an hour . You should just take a cab . __eou__ Won't that be expensive ? __eou__ No , from here I think it's only about 5 dollars . __eou__
Jane , we are going to have a board meeting next Friday . Will you please arrange it for me ? __eou__ Certainly , Mr . Robert . But can I have your plan ? __eou__ Sure . Actually it's a routine board meeting . The things to be discussed are all written here . __eou__ Very good . May I keep it ? I need it to draw up a notice of the meeting and the agenda . __eou__ Go ahead . It's for your reference . While you are at it , make me a special agenda and don't forget to have enough room at the side for notes . __eou__ You mean you need a more detailed agenda for yourself ? __eou__ Exactly . As I am supposed to the chair of the meeting , I don't want it to get out of control . __eou__ I see . Ok , then where do you think we will have the meeting ? __eou__ The conference room on the second floor , is that ok ? __eou__ Yes , I will see that the room is ready by Friday . And I will check there are enough chairs , and the lighting and air-conditioning are all right . __eou__ Good , and please get some water , glasses and ash tray ready as well . __eou__ Sure , I will . What about the minutes ? Do you think I am responsible for that too ? __eou__ Definitely . The minutes have to be taken accurately . __eou__ But I am not familiar with the members of the board . __eou__ Oh , that's easy . I will write you a list of their names . You can make a seating plan with the names and give each one a number . __eou__ That's a good idea . All right , I ’ ll withdraw and get down to it if you don't mind . __eou__
Please tell us the exact time when the big fire broke out . __eou__ The exact time ? Let me think . You know , it happened at night . __eou__ But we need the exact time . What time ? __eou__ Oh , I remember . It was about 10 o'clock . When I was about to go to bed , suddenly I heard help outside . __eou__
Do you have any sales experience ? __eou__ Yes , I worked in a fashion shop as a part time salesgirl . __eou__ What kind of work are you doing now ? __eou__ I'm working as an export sales staff member for a trade company . __eou__ Where are you working ? __eou__ I work at Yangshi Trade Company Ltd . I have been working there since 1997 . __eou__
Hi , I need broadband for my computer . __eou__ No problem . Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer , and you're good to go . __eou__ That's a problem . My laptop has no Ethernet port , it's wireless only . __eou__ Hmm . Well , we have some alternatives , if you're interested . __eou__ Go ahead . I'm all ears . __eou__ We have a computer lab on the first floor . __eou__ That's great ! How much is it ? __eou__ It's absolutely free to guests . Except for printing , of course . __eou__ Okay . What about the other alternatives ? __eou__ You could use your wireless right here in our lobby . __eou__ Yes , that's the ticket ! And if I need to print something there ? __eou__ Well , we don't have a printer in the lobby yet . You'll have to use the lab . __eou__
I really want to take a nap . I feel very sleepy today . __eou__ What ’ s the matter ? Didn ’ t you get enough sleep last night ? __eou__ I fell asleep very late . It was almost two o ’ clock in the morning when I finally fell asleep . __eou__ Are you worried about something ? Why couldn ’ t you sleep ? __eou__ You know how it is when you ’ re in a strange country . Everything is new , and you get tired and nervous sometimes . Then you worry about your family , about conditions back home , about your courses , about your money , about everything . I tried to fall asleep but I just had too much on my mind . __eou__ Well , take it easy . Things will look better tomorrow . Maybe you should try exercising or a hot bath to help you relax . __eou__ Anything is worth a try . But right now I really just want to find a quiet place to take a nap . __eou__
Mr . Li , the report has been finished . __eou__ So fast ! Thank you . __eou__ You're welcome . This is my duty . Anything else ? __eou__ Yes , you'd print out the address and telephone number of those guests from your computer , and then send those materials to each business worker . __eou__ OK , I'll do it right now . __eou__ By the way , to tell them try to persuade those new guests to cooperate with us . Because I found a biggest opponent from this post-trip . __eou__ Yes , I get it . __eou__ OK , it's no anything . Do what you should do . __eou__
Dad , do you know where Mom is ? __eou__ I think she is in her room putting a little something together for you to take to school with you . __eou__ She'd better not start crying like she usually does . __eou__ I know , but she is going to miss you something awful . Have I told you how proud I am of you ? __eou__ Dad , now don't you go getting mush on me . __eou__ I mean it . You have really shown us that you are prepared to take on the adult world . __eou__ That means a lot to me Dad . Thanks . __eou__ We have great confidence in you . __eou__
Well , sir . We are asking all our guests to wear a jacket and a tie in our restaurant . __eou__ Is that so ? I didn't know it . can I possibly borrow a jacket and a tie ? __eou__ I am sorry ; you can't borrow a jacket and a tie . __eou__ Then we'll return to the hotel and come back , will you change the appointment ? __eou__ Certainly , what time will you come back ? __eou__ At 7 , please . __eou__ How many in your party ? __eou__ A party of 13 . __eou__ Alright , we are waiting for you at 7 . __eou__

Move to the rear of the bus . There are plenty of seats in the rear . __eou__ Wait . I want to ask you if this bus goes down Fifth Avenue as far as Greenwich Village . __eou__ That's right.Move along , please.There are more people waiting to get on.Move to the rear . __eou__ I thought this bus Went down Park Avenue . __eou__ No , that's the number l that goes down Park Avenue.This is the number 2 . __eou__ But I thought this was the right bus to go to Washington Square Park . __eou__ It is.Get in.please.You ' re holding everyone up.You can't miss Washington Square Park . __eou__ Would you tell me when we get there ? __eou__ It would be better if you watched out for yourself . I might forget . __eou__
How do you spend your free time ? __eou__ I read or go swimming , go shopping , usually . I run or play tennis or do something else like those to get some exercises to keep fit . __eou__ Are you introverted or extroverted ? __eou__ I wouldn't call myself extroverted . Sometimes , I enjoy being by myself very much . But other times , I like sharing activities with others too , especially during these last few years . __eou__ What kinds of sports do you like ? __eou__ I like almost all sports , and I enjoy both playing and watching . I especially like tennis and mountain climbing . __eou__ What kind of personality do you think you have ? __eou__ Well , I approach things very enthusiastically , I think , and I don't like to leave something half-done . It makes me nervous-I can't concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished . __eou__
I need to eat something . __eou__ You just ate . __eou__ I know , but I'm hungry again . __eou__ There's no food left from dinner . __eou__ I think I'm going to go make myself a snack . __eou__ Do you know what kind of snack that you want ? __eou__ I'm not exactly sure . __eou__ Why don't you make yourself a sandwich or something ? __eou__ I have no idea what kind of sandwich I want to make . __eou__ A PB & J is pretty easy to make . __eou__ I'm going to do that . __eou__ Knock yourself out . __eou__
Waiter , bring me the menu , will you ? __eou__ Just a moment , I'm coming . ( ten minutes later ) . Now , what would you like ? __eou__ I'd like to see the menu . Would you get me one , please ? __eou__ Yes , certainly . Here you are . __eou__ Thank you . Ah ! But this is in French . Would you mind giving me the English menu ? __eou__ It's written in English too , in smaller print . There . __eou__ Thanks . I'll need a while to choose . Could you come back in a minute ? __eou__ Right . ( five minutes later ) Now , what are you having ? __eou__ I'm sorry , I haven't decided yet . Do you mind giving me a couple of minutes ? __eou__ All right , but would you be so kind as to make up your mind soon ? We're very busy just now as you can see , sir . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ Hi , this is Sharon in Mr . Reynolds ’ s office . One of your delivery men picked up a package here about an hour ago . __eou__ Yes , is there a problem ? Ma ’ am ? __eou__ Well , it still hasn ’ t reached its destination . I wonder if you could track it down for us . Mr . Reynolds is a bit concerned . __eou__
You know we went great lengths to promote the sales of your products . Through our continuous effort , consumers tend to accept your product . So , there will be a potential market for your product in this area , and would you let us act as your agent ? __eou__ We appreciate your efforts in promoting the sale of our clothes in the market of this city . But according to our record , your annual turnover is not too big , so I think it is premature for us to discuss the question of agency . __eou__ If that's the case , we can talk about it first . What's your concept of a big amount ? __eou__ I mean to double the amount for your sales this year at least . __eou__ I'm afraid that's too much for us . __eou__ We know you have done a good job in building up these exports for us . However , our company has the regulation for the agency . __eou__ All right , we accept the challenge . What about the commission ? You know , we usually get a 20 % commission of the amount on every deal . __eou__ I am sorry to say that it's a little higher . Our agents in other areas usually get a 3 % to 6 % commission . __eou__ You may have known that we have competitors from South Korea and other countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and TV programs . A 20 % commission will not leave us much . __eou__ Our price is worked out according to the costing . A 20 % commission means an increase in our price . So , I'm afraid we have to decline your proposal of acting as our sole agent . __eou__ Oh , that's pitiful . __eou__
We ’ Ve got a lot of work to do now , but take your time over this project . We don ’ t want to make any mistakes . __eou__ Ok . I should have it finished by Friday afternoon . Then I can check those account over the weekend . We need to have them finished by Monday , right ? __eou__ That ’ s right . We ’ ll finish them just in time . The Macy project can wait for the time being . We need to spend several days on that project , but it isn ’ t due to be finished until the end of the month , so we have plenty of time to get it done . __eou__ Some next week on , we should be in less of a rush . __eou__ I ’ m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . Everyone deserves it . __eou__ Don ’ t say that yet . A new project could suddenly appear . __eou__ That ’ s true . Right . I ’ m going back to the meeting . It ’ s been going on for hours and there ’ s no indication that it ’ ll end soon . __eou__ Carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is up-to-date with their work . __eou__ Good . I have to go right now . I really hope this meeting doesn ’ t last too long . __eou__ They usually go on for ages . __eou__ I ’ ll stop by if I have time later . Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines . __eou__ I will . Enjoy your meeting ! __eou__
Where did you get assigned to go this time around ? __eou__ They asked me to go to Paris to check on the new office that was just established there . And you ? __eou__ Hong Kong again . I would like to go somewhere different for a change . __eou__ Teach me Cantonese and I'll pull some strings to get a trade with you next time around . __eou__ If you really want to learn , remind me when you get back from your business trip . __eou__ You're on . __eou__ When do you leave ? __eou__ I'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth . __eou__
What bus can I catch to get to the Gold Line ? __eou__ Tell me where you live . __eou__ I live in Altadena . __eou__ You can catch the 264 . __eou__ It goes to the Gold Line ? __eou__ Yes , it does . __eou__ What street do I go to to catch it ? __eou__ You can catch it on Altadena Drive . __eou__ I had no idea that bus went to the station . __eou__ Yes , it does . __eou__ I'm glad you told me . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
Can you skillfully operate the computer ? __eou__ Yes , I can . I have three years experience in operating computers . __eou__ What kind of software can you use ? __eou__ I can skillfully use Dos , Windows . __eou__ Do you have any certificates on computer ? __eou__ Yes , I have ACRE certificate , rank 2 . __eou__ Any other certificates ? __eou__ Yes , I have a Cambridge Business English Certificate and Lawyer ’ s Qualification Certificate . __eou__ Do you have any other special skills ? __eou__ I like photography very much . I used to be awarded second prize in a photography contest at our university . __eou__
Hello everyone , and welcome to our CPR for beginners course . First of all , does anyone know what CPR stands for ? __eou__ Cardiopulmonary resuscitation ! __eou__ That ’ s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest . __eou__ What does that mean ? __eou__ Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ’ s begin ! I need a volunteer . __eou__ Me ! Me ! __eou__ Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this . __eou__ Wait , what are you doing ? I ’ m a married woman ! You can ’ t just try to kiss me like this ! __eou__ Madam I ’ m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency . __eou__ Well , OK . But no French kissing ! __eou__ As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . To do this , we place our hands over the person ’ s chest , and press down firmly two or three times . __eou__ Wait , what are you doing ! You can ’ t just kiss me then go for second base ! __eou__
Hello ? __eou__ Hi , David . You are very difficult to reach . I called several times . But I kept getting a busy signal . Is your phone out of order ? __eou__ No , not out of order . But we seem to have a bad connection on the phone line . I can ’ t hear you clearly . __eou__ Ok . Let me call you later . Is that okay ? __eou__ Sure . Thanks . __eou__
Excuse me , can I have a look at the green coat ? __eou__ Certainly . Here you are . It's a new arrival . __eou__ Yes , I like the style.Can I try this on ? __eou__ Sure . The fitting room is in the corner . __eou__
Excuse me . I need to refill this prescription . __eou__ It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills . __eou__ Yes , I need to refill it today . __eou__ Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice . __eou__ I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not . __eou__ Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription . __eou__ Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ? __eou__ I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out . __eou__ But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription . __eou__ Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never . __eou__ But I have a prescription . I just need more of it . __eou__ A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you . __eou__ Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor . __eou__ Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry . __eou__ This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . __eou__ Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too . __eou__
Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ? __eou__ I don't want to . __eou__ Well , come over and talk to me then . __eou__ Certainly not . __eou__ May I turn on the TV then ? __eou__ Turn on the TV , for what ? __eou__ So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . __eou__ Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ? __eou__ I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner . __eou__ To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it . __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ I'd like to buy some Chinese-style cakes . Could you recommend me some ? __eou__ Certainly . What about moon cake ? It's typical Chinese food . __eou__ Moon cakes ? What is that ? __eou__ The moon cake is round and looks like the full moon . That's why it's called the moon cake and the moon cake symbolizes family reunion and harmony . __eou__ Sounds very interesting . I'll buy some to family people . __eou__ All the moon cakes are generally classified into two styles , Cantonese style and Suzhou style . __eou__ What's the difference between these two styles ? __eou__ The skin of Cantonese style cakes is soft and puffy with heavy stuffing while the skin of Suzhou style cakes is puffy filled with fragrant nuts . __eou__ Get me some of each . __eou__ OK , here you are . __eou__
How would you comment on the paper ? __eou__ The paper editorials always stick to the quick . __eou__ Don't you think it's a bit conservative ? __eou__ After all , I'm somewhat conservative . __eou__

The key to play volleyball is to cooperate with each other . __eou__ What should I do ? __eou__ You go figure it out yourself . __eou__ Got it , Mom . __eou__ OK , Ben and May , here we go . Be careful , Danny , the ball is coming . That is the green one . __eou__ Mom , don't worry about me , I can do it . __eou__ Danny , back to your position . Move ! __eou__ OK . Bingo ! We win . Give me five , Mom . __eou__
What's the matter ? __eou__ Which subway should I take to get to the East Side ? __eou__ Oh , you have to take the shuttle to Grand Central . __eou__ Which train is that ? Which platform does it leave from ? __eou__ It's not on this platform . These trains are uptown and downtown , not crosstown . You have to go up these stairs over there . __eou__
Hi ! Does this hotel have an exercise facility ? __eou__ But of course ! We have a great exercise facility . __eou__ Good . Now exactly where is it ? __eou__ It's located right under our lobby . Just take the elevator or the stairs one flight down . __eou__ Is this going to cost me anything ? __eou__ No , sir . The gym is absolutely free . However , be sure to take your room key with you . __eou__ When does the gym open and close ? __eou__ The hours couldn't be better , 24/7 . __eou__ Very good . Now , is there a trainer down there ? __eou__ I wish I could tell you yes , but no , there isn't . __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ I'd like to buy a new mobile phone please . __eou__ Ok , would you like a phone with camera and MP3 player ? __eou__ Yes please . And I ’ d like to be able to make video calls too . __eou__
I guess you should know that you need to be hospitalized . __eou__ Of course I know . __eou__ Now you can go to the in-patient department to go through the admission procedures . __eou__ OK . I'll go right now . By the way , do you think I ’ ll have to stay in the hospital for long ? __eou__ It's hard to say . It depends on your recovery condition . But you need to stay for at least one day for observation . __eou__ Thank you , Doctor . I will go now . Bye-bye . __eou__ Bye ! __eou__
Sir , I am very glad to tell that we have successfully registered the trademark for our new product . It is the time to think of some effective promoting strategies . We are beginning to get more attention from overseas . __eou__ Well done , Fred . Do you know something useful for our promotion for our I-series ? __eou__ OK , Let me see . I suppose we must strengthen our promotion , because our brand is still new to some consumers . Maybe we should start our advertising program with our local and overseas distributors simultaneously , because they stand on a better position for selecting the best ways to advertise in market places . Besides , the advertisement fund can encourage them to spend more attention on advertising our products . __eou__ That is a good idea to start with . I also think the mass media is also a good approach for advertising . __eou__ Yes , the mass media has wider influence . One of my classmates works in an advertisement company . I can get help and inspiration from him . And we can also try some less expensive approaches of advertising , such as on-line sales . Personally , I prefer to the on-line sales , for it is cheaper , faster and wider . __eou__
Waiter , come here please . Could we have a doggie bag ? __eou__ Sure . Wait a moment . __eou__

I ’ ll see you tomorrow when you return to work . __eou__

Don't worry about your work.It ' s silly to worry . Take regular exercise . __eou__ But I may lose my job , doctor !

What did you cook ? __eou__ Well , as you know I was in Thailand last month , and I took a cooking class ! So I prepared some of my favorite dishes . __eou__ Great idea ! As long as I don't get food poisoning ! So what is on the menu tonight ? __eou__ Ok , for starters we have Tom Yam soup . It's a bit spicy , but really good ! __eou__ This is delicious !

It ’ s time to get up . __eou__ I just went to bed . __eou__ You shouldn ’ t stay up so late watching TV . I told you we had to get an early start . __eou__ I know , but that movie was just too good to leave . I guess I ’ ll just have to pay the price anti-sleepy . __eou__ Do you want to eat breakfast here ? __eou__ No . why don ’ t we describe and buy at the coffee shop next door ? __eou__ Ok by me . __eou__
Hi ! Someone has reported a fault on one of your copiers . __eou__ That's right . I'm glad you're here . It hasn't been working properly for the last few days . __eou__ When was it serviced ? __eou__ Just a couple of weeks ago . It's usually very reliable . __eou__ What's actually wrong with it ? __eou__ Well , it's making a strange noise when we try to change paper trays . __eou__ I'm sure it's nothing serious , probably just a minor fault . I'll have a look at it . __eou__
I don't know , but he gives me the creeps . __eou__ Just take it easy . If he starts to bother you , let me know and I'll call security . __eou__ But what if he knows my name , where I live ... __eou__ Don't get all worked up over him . He's probably harmless . __eou__ Actually , he's really good-looking . Too bad he's a weirdo . __eou__ You never know . Maybe he's just an innocent , lonely guy ... __eou__ Now he's looking over here ! He's coming ! __eou__ OK ! I'll call security . __eou__

Hello , Doctor . __eou__ Well , What seems to be the trouble , Mr . Williams ? __eou__ It's nothing serious actually , doctor . It ’ s ... Well , I get tired very easily recently , and I often doze off during meetings , office hours and sometimes even while I'm dining . __eou__ How long has this been going on ? __eou__ About two months . I didn't pay much attention to it in the beginning , but you see , I got fired this morning . I dozed off while we were having an important meeting , right in front of the boss .

Good afternoon , you look a little stuck . Can I help ? __eou__ The thing is , I've got all of this information here , all of these leaflets , but I can't make head nor tail of them ! __eou__ I see . What is it exactly that you are interested in ? __eou__ I'm not sure which would be better for me ; buying some insurance or putting my money in a Savings Deposit . __eou__ Well , that all depends on how much you want to invest . __eou__ I was thinking of around 10,000 RIB . __eou__ That's a nice round figure to deal with ! OK , if you were to buy this insurance policy , your yearly fixed income from it would be 94.35 RIB . __eou__ And for the Savings Deposit ? __eou__ For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more . You see , in time deposit , the interest rate is 1.58 % after the 20 % interest tax . So , technically you could get more than a third more . __eou__ Wow ! A third more ? Very good . __eou__
Name and examination number , please . __eou__ My name is Han Ran , number is 050920 . __eou__ What part of the country do you come from ? __eou__ I ’ m from Living , Yunnan Province . __eou__ Where is it ? __eou__ It's a very beautiful place in Southwest China . __eou__ Do you have a big family at your hometown ? __eou__ Not very big .

That's bad news . __eou__ It sure is , but I'm going to call HP first , just to make sure . __eou__ Will you lose all your files ? __eou__ No , I always back up my files . __eou__ You're smart . __eou__

We have termites in the wood , cockroaches all over the place , and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard ! __eou__ Well , there ’ s nothing we can ’ t handle . I ’ ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches , but the termites will be harder to get rid of .

Did you go out at all that day to see what was going on ? __eou__ no , we decided to stay in our apartment .

I've read your report , and I'm not sure I agree with you.You think you can get attendance improved by requiring salaried employees to take their all of their sick days ? __eou__ That's right . I know it must sound crazy to you , but we believe there will be fewer absences this way . __eou__ We give them 10 or 15 sick days per year . Surely requiring people to take them couldn't possibly help . It sounds like a counter - productive policy change to me . __eou__ Right now , we have incentives encouraging employees to come to work as often as possible.But employees with colds and the flu are coming to work and infecting their colleagues . __eou__ I see . So our current policies are encouraging sick people to come to work , resulting in more sick employees . __eou__ That's right . If sick days were mandatory , sick people would stay home . We wouldn't have these company-wide epidemics . __eou__ Let's give it a shot ! __eou__

What is your favorite coffee ? __eou__ Irish coffee is my favorite . But I'm not particular on it . __eou__ All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ? __eou__ Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee . __eou__ I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient . __eou__ Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world . __eou__ I agree . I heard that in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ? __eou__ Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee . __eou__ No , we don't , especially the elder people . But more and more young people fall for coffee nowadays . __eou__ I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffee houses in China now . __eou__

We'll get this case worked out in no time . __eou__
when do most children start school in your country ? __eou__ In America , most children start primary school at the age of five . __eou__ How much time do primary school students usually spend at school every day ? __eou__ Kindergarten students usually only go to school for about four hours every day , but after that , they spend about eight hours in school every day . __eou__ do they have to go to school on Saturdays ? __eou__ no , most children in America only go to school Monday through Friday . __eou__ how many subjects do they have to study ? __eou__ In most schools , they study about nine subjects . __eou__ do students have to wear uniforms in schools in America ? __eou__ some private schools require their students to wear uniforms , but public schools don't . __eou__ did you go to a public school or a private school ? __eou__ I went to a private school for elementary school and university , but went to a public school for high school .

Of course , as you can see from the content of our presentation today , with renewable resource , there is a much larger sustainability than with non-renewable resource . __eou__

The paper is then coated . And finally it's wound onto reels and cut down into smaller lengths . __eou__

I think we have everything in the contract . Shall we sign it ? __eou__ Wait a minute . I think we have missed an important point .

But I still think the provision of arbitration is of great importance to both of us . __eou__ All right . I agree with you . But where do we hold arbitration ? __eou__ I suggest the arbitration be held in a third country . __eou__ It sounds reasonable . The clause should be like this - any disputes arising from the execution of this contract shall be settled in a friendly way . If no settlement can be reached through consul - nation and conciliation , the disputes shall be submitted for arbitration by a mutually nominated arbitrator . The arbitrator's decision on the dispute is final and binding on the both parties . __eou__ Ok . __eou__

Anyway , I'll prepare some vegetarian food for the barbecue . See you then ! __eou__

Can you help me set up my voicemail message ? I just got this service and I am not really sure what I am supposed to say . __eou__ Sure !

I will call you later , so leave me your name and number " . __eou__ That's more or less the idea , but try something that sounds more friendly . __eou__ Ok , so how about this , " This is Abby and I am really happy you called ! I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can , so please leave me your name and number . Talk to you soon ! " . __eou__ A little too friendly Abby .

I think I should join a fitness centre . I am getting a little fat and I'm totally out of shape .

That's the main reason you're unhealthy . __eou__ I guess you're right . I've tried stopping , but I just can't seem to quit . __eou__ Why don't you try smoking one cigarette less each day ?

You don't need to jog far . __eou__ If I do a few exercises at home , like crunches , I'll soon deal with this waistline . __eou__ Be careful when you go jogging . Don't put yourself under too much stress . You're still a smoker shouldn't do too much exercises in your condition . __eou__ I'll join a fitness centre .

The trainers at the fitness centre will be able to advise you on your diet . __eou__

I think it is easier to buy a car than to maintain it . What ’ s worse , I just don ’ t trust those vehicle maintenance shops . Sometimes , they overcharge or don ’ t build those parts I have been paying for . Last week , they even tried to persuade me to buy new parts which really need not to be changed . You know , my car is just half a year old and also good brand . I was just wondering about all these . __eou__ There are such shops living on selling parts . I don ’ t like their service either . All they want is your money . But in the long run , they will be losing costumers . Anyway , car service business is new in China . We all have to control what they are doing . Otherwise , they will not improve . __eou__ Is it possible to make a compliant call to some organization what it ’ s someone gets rip-off . __eou__ Yes , there is . Those organizations exist . You always can call a lawyer if you need legal help . __eou__

Using my speciality in marketing and management . And getting advancement in salary and position . Show my enterprise , confidence and character in passing . __eou__ If you were choosing a person for this job , what kind of individual would you select ? __eou__ I would select the individual that has the most qualifications among all the applicants . He doesn ’ t have to be the person if we have to fill the vacancy . But he has to be the best , even if we have to pay him higher . __eou__ If we do not employ you , what are you going to do ? __eou__ I will feel it is a pity . But I will not feel so bad .

Bobby ! Come here , look what I got you ! __eou__ What is that ? __eou__ A chess board ! Daddy is going to teach you how to play ! __eou__ Cool ! __eou__ Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward .

The one with the tall hat is called the bishop . See this little horsey ?

Good idea ! I've heard that the Expo is doing pretty well now , and ads are seen everywhere in the country on all means of media , newspapers , TV , street signs , etc . __eou__ Yeah , it's the last world-wide horti-cultural exposition in the century , and one of the grand festivities of cross-century significance held by the China's tourism industry . __eou__ what's interesting to see there ? __eou__ Oh , there's plenty . Flowers and plants from all over the world , of course . Besides , gardening techniques are demonstrated , modern facilities displayed , academic exchanges and seminars organized , and folk performances of different nations shown almost every day . __eou__ I visited the First International Flower Festival in the city last year , and was impressed with so many beautiful flowers ! __eou__ Oh , can't compare with the Kunming Expo at all ! The Kunming Expo covers an area of 218 hectares , and more than 9000 flower enterprises from over 100 countries and regions are invited to participate in the Expo . __eou__ It would be a rare occasion to be able to appreciate so many fine species of Chinese and foreign flowers fully blooming in one park ! __eou__ Far more than that , I dare to say ! Inland provinces and cities , Hong Kong and Macao , as well as many countries and regions in the world have an exhibition area of their own to display their unique flowers and plants . Each month there's a special day for a particular country or region , and folk performances are given . You will feel it a great pity if you missile Kunming Expo . __eou__

Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background . __eou__ I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used . __eou__ What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ? __eou__ Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input . __eou__ Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ? __eou__ There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort . __eou__ Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome . __eou__ I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done . __eou__ What are your strengths and weaknesses ? __eou__ My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more . __eou__ Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss . __eou__ I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day . __eou__ When do you find a job satisfying ? __eou__ My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner . __eou__ How would your coworkers describe you ? __eou__ First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously . __eou__ Do you have any questions ? __eou__ Yes , I do . On a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ? __eou__
Where do you want to go ? __eou__ I am going to the Capital Hotel . __eou__ Get in . I will take you there . __eou__ About how much it will cost ? __eou__ $ 50 . __eou__ On the meter ? __eou__ Ye , of course . __eou__ OK.let ' s go . __eou__
I see by your resume that you have just graduated from college . I assume you haven't had any working experience . Is that right ? __eou__ That's right . I've only had some part-time jobs working in department stores . __eou__ Well , experience is not important in this job . We are looking for a man we can train to be a teller . By the way , do you like to work with figures ? __eou__ Yes , I liked math in school . __eou__ We are more interested in finding someone who is alert and quick at figures . Do you like meeting the public ? __eou__ Yes , I enjoy working with people . __eou__ We have very pleasant working conditions and I think we have a fine staff to work with . You would be assigned an experienced employee to help you . He would be responsible for training you . Have you studied English conversation ? __eou__ Yes , I had an American tutor for two years . I had two lessons under her every week . Would I be using English every day is this job ? __eou__ Yes , many of our customers are Americans , so you would be speaking English with most of them . Do you know anything about various kinds of savings and checking accounts ? __eou__ No , I'm afraid I don't . I'd be glad to learn . __eou__ That's good answer . I appreciate your being frank . __eou__
Would you mind doing something for me ? __eou__ I would if I could . __eou__ Will you please explain the meaning of this word ? __eou__ Yes , with pleasure . __eou__
What games do you like ? __eou__ I like word games . __eou__ How about a game of bridge ? __eou__ I don't like it at all . __eou__ What about guessing games ? __eou__ I'm not one for the games . __eou__ Let's play other game . __eou__ What about playing go ? __eou__ OK . __eou__
Excuse me . Could you tell me where the post office is ? __eou__ Sure . If you get on this road and turn left at the second intersection , you'll see it on your right-hand side . __eou__ Thank you so much for your assistance ! __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__
Your English has really improved in the two months you've been here , too . __eou__ Do you have to work late at the computer company again tonight ? __eou__ No , I'm going to leave the office early today . My annual medical check-up is this afternoon . __eou__ How much longer will Mr . Schmidt be up in the mountains ? __eou__ He's on a weeklong meditation retreat and won't be back until this weekend . __eou__
Can you work over tonight ? __eou__ Sorry , I'm supposed to be with my son . __eou__ Okay , I'll ask Bob to cover it . __eou__ Thanks . I appreciate it . __eou__

Do you have enough plates and utensils ? __eou__ I think so . I bought some paper plates and cups for people to use . It will save on the washing up ! __eou__ And if people drop them , they won ’ t break . We ’ ll need to buy some buns to make hot dogs and hamburgers . __eou__ They sell them at the shop around the corner . We can go and get some in a few minutes . __eou__ I brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs . We ’ ll need some tomato ketchup and some barbecue sauce . __eou__ I have the sauce , but remind me to get some ketchup at the shop . __eou__ How long does it take to cook meat on a barbecue ? __eou__ It only takes a few minutes . Some people like their meat well done . Others like it rare . The great thing about a barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked . __eou__ They can cook it themselves to make sure it ’ s exactly how they like it . __eou__ I hope you haven ’ t invited any vegetarians ! __eou__
How would you describe your ideal job ? __eou__ I think the job should make use of the professional experience I have obtained , and offer me opportunity for advancement . __eou__ Why do you think you might like to work for our company ? __eou__ I feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and I am very interested.What ' s more , your company is outstanding in this field . __eou__ What makes you think you would be a success in this position ? __eou__ My graduate school training combined with my experience as an intern should qualify me for this particular job .

The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat ! __eou__ I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets ! __eou__ Our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes . __eou__ I see . Well , then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . It was really tiring for me . __eou__ I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today . __eou__ Thank you . I can't imagine getting much done today . I'm just too exhausted ! __eou__ No problem . Did you bring any gifts back for your department ? __eou__ No , should I have ? __eou__

Good morning , everybody . Welcome to IAM Technology . I'm very pleased so many of you could make it here today . My name's Sam Weiss . I'm the Production Manager . I'd like to show you the layout of the factory before we go and visit it . As you can see from this diagram , everything is under one roof . We've designed it this way to help the flow of materials and to avoid bottlenecks . __eou__ This area here is where we keep our raw materials . The main production area - our machine hall - is situated next to it . Maintenance is situated between the stores and the production area . Just to the right of Maintenance , there are steps up to the Lab and the Admin Section . Process Control is also on the upper level . It's located above the factory floor so that the operators can monitor everything that is going on below . __eou__
Excuse me , driver , where is the main area for restaurants ? __eou__ It's near the Wall Street , a bit far from there . Why not get on the car __eou__ OK .
